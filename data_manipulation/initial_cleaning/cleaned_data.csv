https://archiveofourown.org/works/46990717,Bait,Hey Mastriani.Jess grinned leaning back against her bedroom door and relishing the sound of Robs voice through the tinny speaker of her cell phone. Between Robs hectic work and college schedule and her own classes and commitments to her family restaurants Jess Were so glad youve moved back home Because we really needed a hand with the new steam table at Joes. they had barely seen each other over the last three weeks. Jesss mom had outright forbidden her from moving in to Robs place and much to her chagrin Rob hadnt argued still trying to gain the approval of the Mastriani elders. So it was that despite the shiny nugget of gold nestled on her finger this was the first time Jess had heard from her fianc√© in days.Hey yourself she said unable to keep the grin out of her voice. She never was able to keep to Ruths Rules for Boys when it came to Rob. Hows it goingBetter now that Im speaking to you came Robs reply. Jess felt a happy flush creep up her neck at his words. How was class todayIt was actually really cool. We had this lecturer come in and talk about cognitive overload and how that can really affect kids retention of new facts and thats why so many students struggle with taking in new information day after day because its like their brains have soaked up everything they can and its like trying to put more water into a sponge when its already full and Jess caught herself. Sorry I was going on again wasnt IRob chuckled down the phone. I would listen to you go on for hours and not get bored he said making Jesss stomach flip flop. Unfortunately Jess heard a car horn beeping in the background I have a customer so I cant.Ugh youre taking another night shift Youll work yourself to death.Passes the hours until I get to see you again.You softy Jess replied her heart soaring.Ive just missed you is all. Speaking of which you still on for tomorrowWouldnt miss it even if a tornado blew through town.Great. Jess was amused to hear that Rob sounded relieved. How could he still be in any doubt of her affection Ill pick you up from yours at eight.See you then.Jess held her phone to her chest after hanging up not caring that she was still acting like a high school student with her first crush. Something about Rob just undid her and she wouldnt have it any other way. Although she hadnt risked a skirt in the hope that Rob would bring his Indian rather than his truck Jess felt pretty good about her ensemble as she checked out her reflection in the glass of the French doors. She had to reluctantly agree that Ruth was right that heeled boots would make her legs look way sexier in jeans and she already knew Robs weakness for a simple Vneck shirt so all in all she was fairly confident that she would be getting an invite back to Robs place after dinner tonight. A touch of cherry chapstick and he was sure to be putty in her hands.A quick glance at her Robs watch told her that he was due in five minutes. Unable to stand her dads amused glances at her endless pacing Jess called out her goodbyes and went to sit on the porch swing straining to hear the sound of an engine coming down the lane.Eight oclock came and went. As did ten past. By quarter past Jess was starting to get cross.Robs cell went to answer phone. By half past she was starting to get worried.Rob was normally very punctual especially when it came to dates. Once again there was no answer on Robs cell. Making up her mind Jess went back into the house to grab her bike keys and helmet.Jess Is that youJess resisted the urge to cringe. She had hoped that her mom wouldnt notice her come in but of course she saw her from the kitchen.Yeah.I thought Robert was picking you up tonightYeah slight change of plans Im going to ride out to meet him save him coming over all this way Jess lied through her teeth. She didnt want to have to explain anything to her mom just now it would only end in a row. Grabbing her stuff from the pegs she opened the door again but was stopped before she could escape.Jess It was her dad leaning over the back of the sofa and looking back at her. Everything okayJess felt a lump rise in her throat and quickly swallowed it back down. Lying to her dad was much harder. Yeah everythings fine Rob just got held up at work is all.Her dad narrowed his eyes at her but nodded. Hmm. Okay. Ride safe.Of course Jess said before flinging herself out the door and slamming it behind her. She leant against it for a moment before pulling out her bike and heading off down the road.As soon as she was on the road on her bike Jess found herself able to think a bit clearer. Rob probably got caught up on a job at work or something. She started to head towards his garage when another thought occurred to her. Perhaps he had gone back home to change and had ended up falling asleep. He had been working a lot recentlyWhile Jess was hesitating at a junction trying to decide whether to head towards the garage or Robs house her cell suddenly started ringing the sound making her jump. She pulled over to the side of the road and fished her phone out of her jacket feeling equal parts relieved and irritated seeing Robs name on the caller ID.Where the hell are you she started her worry bubbling over into irritation now that he had finally called.JessUhoh Jess thought knowing it was never a good thing when Rob addressed her by her first name.Jess Im real sorry but Im Rob cleared his throat and Jess could hear what sounded like him shuffling uncomfortably. Im going to have to call off tonight. Somethinguh something came up.Something came up Jess repeated letting her anger cover the hurt that felt like a punch to the gut.Yeah and uh dont try calling me.Jess struggled with a wave of rejection at Robs words. She could hear lots of noise in the background and someone elses muffled voice. Rob what the hell Who are you with Whats For a moment all Jess could hear what sounded like someone dragging a chair over the ground before Robs voice came over the phone his words hurried and urgent.Its not gonna work between us. Its over. Dont contact me again.The line went dead.Jess stared at her phone in horror her brain refusing to process what had just happened. Eventually the disbelief was pushed aside by a wave of pure agony and with a primal scream Jess threw the phone with all her might at the nearest tree. It smashed against it with a crack dropping to the ground in pieces. Slamming her helmet down Jess took off for the city limits somewhere she could let off steam by pushing 100. You goddamn punk Rob squeezed his eyes shut unable to defend himself from the fist he knew was coming with his hands being held behind his back. You were supposed to get her to come here to find you and you go and break up with her A backhand snapped his face to the side. Now theres no way shell come here for you. Despite his bleeding lip Rob smiled. Mission accomplished. You think its funny do you boy All youve done is sign your death warrant that little bit faster. No point in keeping you around if she wont come for you. Rob felt no regret about his actions as the fist connected with his temple and the world started to turn black. He only wished his last words could have been to tell Jess how desperately he loved her rather than breaking her heart.,Teen And Up Audiences,KidnappingRescueBreak UpMotorcycles
https://archiveofourown.org/works/27849038,"Missing You, Are You Missing Me?",Hi. Hows it going Long time no see. Hey I need a favor Jess Im madly in love with you and I swear I never cheated on you please please please come back to me Okay I admit I should have known that there was no way Id be able to plan what to say ahead of time. But I tried. I ran through a million things in my head tried to picture all the different scenarios most involved a slammed door all the things that I could and couldnt do. I just didnt know though. How could I Until I saw her again really saw her in person as opposed to in photos I wouldnt be able to predict my own reaction let alone hers.And yet somehow in every single one of my imagined scenes I hadnt pictured this.The room the door opened onto was full and loud with a TV blaring two guys shouting at it and some girl way in the background saying something in a loud voice. I mean it was a pretty nice room but you could easily tell that it was currently just too full.And in the front standing holding the door was Jess.Jess. I hadnt seen her in person in about a year not since shed broken up with me. Which didnt really count as seeing her. Really it had been two years since wed even properly spoken so I honestly didnt know what to expect.But Jess still looked the same sort of. I mean she still had the same short hair the same face even the same clothes and she looked just as good as ever in them. I mean she was hot. From her hair shorter than mine like always to her sneakered feet. Jess managed to make simple clothes look good. She just did. I could go on but you know Im just not gonna start. Any more than I already have anyway but I could still tell that shed changed. The changes were invisible but I was all too aware of them seeing as if they had never occurred I wouldnt have spent this past year very unhappy.Now Im not gonna say that Id rather Jess had never gone out and helped with the war after all she saved a lot of lives and Im not that selfish and preferred that she stay home with me and never let that invisible change occur. Really. Im not.I will however freely state that Cyrus Krantz the FBI agent who got her into the whole mess Yeah I hate his weaselly black guts.Jess I said addressing the owner of that name for the first time in far too long is this a bad timeShe stared at me shocked. I guess I cant really blame her. I would be shocked too if some girlfriend from a year or two ago just randomly showed up at my door after Id moved out of state and asked if it was a bad time to talk.God Rob you were thinking about this for hours and you blurted out Is this a bad time Idiot.In the background one of the guys yelled Ask him if he can break a fifty without looking over apparently thinking I was some sort of deliveryboy. I wondered who the two guys were. I couldnt see their faces since the couch faced away from the door and could only hear their voices.Please let them not be boyfriends. Please no.Make sure he remembered the hotpepper flakes. They forgot last time the girls voice called and I remembered that the previously termed Bitch also known as Jesss best friend Ruth was living with her. Id learned this from Doug who for some reason had actually believed me when Id told him about the circumstances of the reason for the breakup.See theres this girl. Woman. Whatever. She has this car that frequently breaks down just bad handling its not like it isnt a perfectly decent car so shes coming in relatively often and well shes not Mensa material is all Ill say. Shes also very excitable blonde and has really big you know. Boobs. Its kinda awkward for all of us mechanics who have girlfriends or wives or whatever because whenever someone successfully fixes her Mercedes Nancy gets very excited and kisses them although sometimes she doesnt generally when its one of the older or more homely guys. Of course since shes pretty a lot of the single guys really like to be the ones to fix her car.Unfortunately that day it was my job and Id just finished and she had jumped forward and kissed me. That must have been what Jess saw. I mean I didnt even know she was there. At the garage or in town. I only found out when I stopped by at the comic shop to buy a SpiderMan and chat with Doug for a bit. But she cant have been there long or else she would have seen me push Nancy away.Nancy Id said We talked about this. I have a girlfriend. And we had talked about it last time Id fixed her car.Sorry she said smiling. I just get so excitedI really wasnt that mad. I mean Nancy might have seemed bad but she was really actually a pretty sweet girl. Just flaky dumb and sort of slutty.But nice.Anyway when I visited Jesss house later that afternoon I was obviously pretty excited. Id had some big plans for that evening really big ones that I dont specifically want to get into right now. But Jess hadnt reacted the way I expected.Yeah to say I was surprised when Jess told me to get the hell off her property I could practically see a rifle held threateningly in her hands well thats probably the definition of understatement.I mean the Jess I knew would never believe Id cheated on her right Okay yeah she could be a little insecure at times but come on Id always thought it was obvious how I felt about her even if I never did work up the guts to admit I loved her before she left.I dont know maybe if I had then Jess even afterthewarlosingherpowers Jess would have had a little more faith in me. Wouldnt have given up so easily. Maybe if Id already told her Id have been smart enough to do more than just get mad and tell her how different shed gotten how damaged. Maybe if shed known I loved her was in love with her I wouldve followed her and not let her run away.But shed never known I guess and I never did follow her. I waited yeah sometimes it feels as if thats all Ive been doing for the past two years waiting but I still let her leave and try to work through everything fix herself on her own.Who knows Maybe its better that I did. I never held much stock in maybes or ifonlys anyway. I mean sure the Jess standing in front of me didnt look exactly happy but much as I might hate to admit it that was probably a direct result of my unexpected presence at her door.God she probably hated me now.This is a bad time I said seizing onto The Bitch and the two mysterious guys they were NOT boyfriends they were NOT boyfriends if they were boyfriends I was gonna have to punch somebody as convenient excuses. Youve got company. I can come back later.Of course I didnt want to leave completely but maybe if I went away for the moment at least Called ahead next time arranged something I dunno. I was beginning to regret not warning her ahead of time that I was coming. But Id suspected and had it confirmed by Doug that if Jess had had any clue I was coming she would have been long gone by the time I arrived.And I guess I could have sent her an email or something. But I felt like this was something I had to do facetoface. Plus I just wanted to see her facetoface.Jess just continued staring at me shock and a couple other expressions I really wished I could interpret on her face. She didnt say a word in response I wasnt sure shed even heard what I said.But one of the male voices did speak again shoving past Jess waving a fiftydollarbill and revealing himself to be much to my relief because Jess would never touch the guy Skip Abramowitz.Hey can you break this he asked. Then I guess he noticed I held no pizza and wasnt wearing a uniform. Ever slow on the uptake I dont really know that. Im just inferring it from him a wanting to go out with Jess so continuously not getting that she never liked him the weekend after my dinner with the Mastrianis and Jesss and my following breakup though it wasnt not really he actually asked her out again and b being The Bitchs brother and such an annoying brother that even she was horrified by the idea of him going out with Jess Skip frowned. Hey wheres the zaFinally he looked at my face and seemed to actually recognize me. Sort of. Hey he said slowly and Christ couldnt he start a sentence with another word There were plenty of options I know you.Before he could continue or I could respond The Bitch walked up holding a pile of plates. Did you remember the hotpepper she stopped midsentence staring at me in shock.Okay she definitely recognized me.Oh she kind of gasped Its itsRob I helped her out sneaking a glance at Jess who still hadnt moved not even when the two Abramowitzes squeezed into the tiny entryway with her. Just continued to stare.Right The Bitch glanced at Jess in much the same way only looking more worried. Rob. From back home.Yeah. Thats me. Rob from back home.You remember Rob Skip The Bitch went on sounding well actually sounding a lot less bitchy than she used to. In fact she really just sounded worried about Jess I guess. Maybe she didnt really deserve that nickname anymore. Maybe I should just start calling her Ruth.I dont know though thats a pretty big stepHow could I forget Skip asked flatly. Now he remembered me properly as Jesss old boyfriend. He glared at me.Okay maybe I was willing to at least consider being nice or civil anyway to his sister even in my head but Skip was still and always would be at the top of my to mock and forever dislike list. No matter what.Right. The BRuth see I can do it if I really try sounded uncomfortable confused and worried now. I guess I couldnt blame her. Well. Do you um do you want to come in RobOkay now I just felt sorry for her.Whats the holdup I heard the voice of the other guy who turned out to be Jesss older brother Mike from what I could see of his face peering over everyones shoulders. Thank god no boyfriends Thank you You guys need change or something he asked.Its not the pizza guy Skip told him without taking his eyes off me Its Rob Wilkins.Who Mike sounded beyond shocked. HereThis was getting ridiculous. And Jess still hadnt said a word or even moved. I was getting kind of fed up.Look I said ignoring everyone else and speaking to Jess. If this is a bad time Jess I can come back All eyes turned to Jess who blushed a little under our collective gazes but still didnt break her mute silence. A long awkward pause followed.Until amazingly enough Ruth no not The Bitch Ruth broke it and took my side.Well just go out and let you two have some time alone together she said beginning to put down her stack of plates on a tiny hall table.Which was nice of her and all but I kind of wanted to leave for the night at least by this point. And I was still getting the very distinct impression from Jess and Mike and Skip too that I wasnt very welcome. Actually Ruth probably didnt want me here either but she was making an effort for Jesss sake despite her dislike of me a first in all the time Id known her. The friendship had seemed to be all give and no take from Jesss side that Id seen which had been yet another contributing factor in me calling her The Bitch.Go out Skip asked sounding very affronted. What about the pizza we orderedHearing that even though I normally wouldnt pay attention to a word out of the guys mouth sealed the deal for me and I shook my head. You know what I said turning Ill come back later.I began to walk away feeling more than a little disappointed even though in all honesty Id feared worse than dead silence Skip aside and still reeling from seeing Jess myself though I obviously didnt show it as much as she did. Or hate the experience as much for that matter.But then as I walked away I heard it. For the first time in a year and for the first time in two years not yelling at me.Her voice.Wait Jess said and I froze pivoting my head around to look back at her. Now that she seemed to have gotten over her shock andor horror at me resurfacing from her past I had no idea what Jess would say. Especially when you factored in our rapt audience.Let me grab my keys were her chosen words We can talk while we grab something to eat somewhere.My heart corny as I am painfully aware it sounds seized up a moment before thumping faster than before.After a brief halt at the little table in which she seemed to be arguing with her brother Jess returned pulling on a coat and tucking her keys into a pocket as she walked. She passed the Abramowitz kids in the hallway saying goodbye to Ruth quickly before joining me in the hallway.She didnt I noted with pleasure even acknowledge Skips presence. Not even when she stepped on his foot in the limited space.Well not until he called after her. I thought we were having pizza Idiot.But Jess still seemed to care what Skip thought of her exactly as much as she had two years ago that is not at all. Save me a slice she told him drawing even with me.And just like that we turned and headed down the stairs together.Mission accomplished,Teen And Up Audiences,RetellingPOV Rob WilkinsImplied/Referenced Underage Sex
https://archiveofourown.org/works/518190,all that's gilded,Jess had fallen in love with the antique ring as soon as she first had laid eyes on it which unfortunately was after it was thrown across a garage. It was fine now and made a nice home for itself on the fourth finger on her left hand. It was beautiful really. She could look at it all night if it was up to her. Jess had never been one for flashy materialistic thingshell Ruth had to force her into wearing skirt her junior year in high schoolbut somehow the glint of the modest ring diamond made Jess want to cry out with joy.Shes been engaged for two years now. She was supposed to wait until after college before getting married but they decided to change things after Douglas made aninteresting announcement. Jess had transferred to the University of Indiana but she wouldnt be graduating on time thanks to that brief stint at Julliard. Now instead of majoring in orchestraor whatever exactly they called it at Julliardshe was attempting to get her teaching degree. So of course she would have to put in another year before she could get her teaching diploma.Then Douglas just ruined everything. He had been her favorite brother until this. Douglas might have let it slip that at Thanksgiving dinner that really they only wanted to hire the best teachers at the alternative and really he thought shed be great but it really wasnt his final decision to make and that a masters degree would look better than just a plain ole bachelors.The conversation ended with Jess promptly shoving her elbow right below his ribcage.She wasnt looking forward to added years of school. College wasnt the piece of crap known as high school and there wasnt as many people she wanted to punch in the faceonly Joey di Josepho but honestly the cheesy Guido accent and the hair gel were the Big Nothere. It was just school and learning. Jess was so over learning.She wanted to graduate and get married and move on with her life.Well at least now she was getting onto the married. After some heavy convincing she managed to get her mother motivated to set the date for this fall. After all if she was going to be in school through her mid twenties she felt it was just accepted to get it over with. Only she didnt use that phrasing with her mom. She used more you can out the decorations type words.Only her mother didnt quite see it that way.Honestly Jessica you make it sound like youre crossing the street. This is important. Its a milestone. A milestone Now what are we going to do about invitations Have you even thought of theme No Jessica you are not going to send out of mass email.So that settled it. This fall she would be Mrs. Jess Wilkins. This September.Which was in one week.Thinking about that Jess tried to calm the panic that threatened to seize her throat. She loved Rob. Really she truly did. Its just that when she actually thought about marriage and settling down She didnt want another boy thats for sure. But she just felt nervous. That was it. Just the nervesIt was three in the morning when she looked at the clock. Less than a week now. Oh God. But no she would be fine and Rob would be fine and everything would be done and good. Right. Oh honestly Jessica you shouldnt be sleeping in so late. Theres just too much to do today. Her mother chided her at seven in the morning.Jess tried to answer but the response was some sort of mashed up gurgle. Instead she threw the covers back over her head regretting that she opted to spend the week leading up to the ceremony at her parents house rather than Robs which she had been living inmuch to her mothers controversyfor the past two years.Jessica Her mother tore the comforter off. Up. Now.And thats how Jess fully woke up that morning. She realized again that though she briefly slept it had been a dreamless sleep. As usual.Its just the nerves she told herself ignoring the photo of a missing infant Rosemary had emailed to her to find.Its just the nerves. The nervous energy that had come from getting engaged. The nerves from starting over at a new college. The nerves of moving in with the boy of her dreams. The nerves of pushing the wedding forward.It was really just the nerves. Thats why she hadnt been able to find anyone since Hannah those long two years ago. She was just too nervous. And too stressed. Only it frustrated Jess to no end because she wasnt broken anymore. She was Jess Mastriani who had her life in control. So why couldnt she find anyone So much of her time spent with ESP she thought of it as a burden which it was. But now that the Feds had backed off Jess thought she could finally make peace with it.Only nothing.Its just because of the nerves.I should have skipped lunch Ruth groaned looking at her reflection in the mirror.Jess shrugged you look fine. Really Ruth. Ruth had managed to drop those extra forty pounds shed been carrying around throughout her adolescent years but she would forever remain selfconscious about her waistline which is why she choose to don a silver bridesmaid dress. Supposedly it was the new slimming shade. Jess didnt know. She let Ruth pick out the dress. Jess had implied that a quick elopement in Vegas wearing jeans and a tshirt would suit her well enough but both Ruth and her mother had put an end to that.Ruth grimaced once more at her reflection. Ill just do a fruit salad for dinner and skip breakfast for the next five days. She pulled out her purse and started rummaging in it. So about your hair. I was thinking maybe we could curl it She let the sentence hang in the air.Curl it Jess ran a finger through her short kept hair. She had let it grow enough so that it was halfway down her neck. If you curl it Robll have longer hair. I thought we were just going to do like a poof with my bangs and I dunno. Maybe put in a nice headband and uh spray in some glitter or some crap.Ruth blinked.Spray in glitter Jessica Mastriani this is your wedding not your eighth grade semi formal Like either Ruth or Jess had gone to that. Plus I bought you these. She pulled what she had been searching in her bag for.No way in hell am I wearing those.But JessI like my short hair. Jess answered scowling at the hair extensions Ruth held up.Dont you just want to feel like a princess JessWhile Jess knew that Ruth was trying to be a good friend like she had been since forever Jess was getting sick of everyone trying to change her.No. I want to feel like Jess Mastriani not like Barbie. Ruth didnt say anything after that. That night Jess Mastriani woke up in a plane. Hold on. Lets back it up a minute.She was riding Blue Beauty downtown when her cell phone started ringing. She ignored it as she did the speed limit. But by the time she made it through three red lights it didnt stop buzzing. She pulled over to the side and didnt recognize the number or the area code.HelloAn unfamiliar voice answered back Jessica MastrianiNot answering the question she replied who is this Howd you get my numberSilence greeted her which only increased her nerves. Great. Jess felt a lump form in her throat. Just what she needed. Creepy guys calling her.Please dont feel threatened Ms. Mastriani. I need your help. My daughter She detected a large trace of sorrow in his voice. I need you to find her.Jess groaned.Look I dont where you got this number but I dont do that anymore okay The sparks gone. The energys fizzled. The bombs defused. Its not like she didnt want to help. Its just that this time she really couldnt.She was about to press the end button until his voice interrupted her please Miss Mastriani. I would not be calling an amateur if I wasnt desperate.Whoa whoa whoa wait just a minute. Amatuer. Amatuer. Jess Mastriani was not an amateur. She had not found every single missing person for two and a half years including notorious war criminals to gain the reputation of an amateur. Maybe the ESP turned itself off now but that didnt mean her record did.Uh excuse me but I am a professional. With a military record. She couldnt contain the annoyance in her voice. Im sorry about your daughter. But I cant find her. Im busy too like Im getting married in a few days. Seriously the ESP isnt working anymore. Im sure the policeYou dont get it The voice blared back at her. The police havent even ruled it as a kidnapping yet. They And suddenly the hardwired started crying in the phone. Jess felt bad she really did. If it was up to her she would give this guy his daughter back. But it wasnt. Please just look at her photo. Then suddenly she got a new picture message. Lo and behold it was a girl no older than Hannah.Im really sorry sir. Then Jess hung up the phone.It was dark by the time Jess decided to head home. She was flying past the cornfields on a deserted road when the car came out of nowhere. Jess couldnt think coherently about what had happened until she was twenty feet in the air and Blue Beauty was in pieces in the road. Then everything went black.Are you feeling alright Ms. Mastriani I could get you an Advil or some waterMeeehrushpmph was the answer Jess gave finally sitting up. Man her head was pounding. And God did her back hurt. Then she remembered the accident. What happened Where am IThe man sat across from her smiled pleasantly as if getting your motorcycle totaled was good thing.You see Miss Mastriani I really need your help. That voice. A few hours ago it sounded unfamiliar but now she was quite acquainted with it.You serious right now Jess said. She could feel her eyes practically bug out of her face. You did not just kidnap me. You have no idea how upset my mother is going to be when I dont come home.His face darkened considerably. As a matter of fact I am well aware of how devastated mothers can be when their children dont come home.Oh right. His daughter had been kidnapped.Youve been out for a good few hours. I expect that you know good and well where Pierce is.Jess was about to started her I Dont Have The Gift Anymore speech when suddenly she realized somethingShe did know where Pierce was.Ohmigod she said incredulously. It felt like suddenly the breath had been knocked out of her.Pierces dad seemed to look a tad uncomfortable. Miss MastrianiThat snapped Jess back into the current situation.First of all I have connections with the United States Government so you are going to be in some very big trouble. Second of all you need to get this plane to bring me back to Indiana right now. Thirdly I need to contact with the Isla Huesos police department immediately.Mr. Pierces dad seemed to perk up immensely.You found her Oh I must tell her mother right away. Where is sheIm not telling you Jess said crossing her arms. It may have seemed childish but Jess new better than to let a parent interfere. Especially if it involved a teenage runaway and the boyfriend. The parents always mess things up. Im going to need to the police.His stupid smile vanished from his face.She ranaway Jess shrugged as if that would explain it. You think the minute her dad appears shes not going to bolt.Pierce did not runaway his eyes narrowed. Of course now she would have to go through the My Child Isnt That Kind of Person act.Just let me tell the police. Then turn this plane around so I can go home capicheHe glared even more menacingly at her. Oh no. Youre not going anywhere until my Pierce is found safe and sound.Whoa. Uh excuse me but Im getting married in like five days. Im kind of tied up at the moment. The groom probably thinks I got cold feet and jetted. Once she said that a cold feeling suddenly crept into her stomach. What if that was what everyone thought right now What if they thought she left on purposeBut the motorcycle in pieces on the Indiana highwayThey probably think youre dead Mr. Pierces dad finished the thought for her out loud.I need to call my mom and Rob right now. She yelled at him. Then I need to call the Isla Huesos police. They can find Pierce and arrest your ass at the same time.He didnt seem so phased by her threat. Why dont you just tell them in person. Id like to welcome you to Isla Huesos Florida.I hate it Jess mumbled.That makes two of us.It was then that his phone rang did he let go of Jess arm after stepping out of the plan that Jess ran as fast she could from this guy.She didnt look back to see if he was following her.When she was far enough away she saw a payphone. Just a quick call and she could be back on a plane to Indiana where no doubt her mom was crying over what she thought happened to her only daughter.But then she thought about Pierce Olivieras mom. And how upset she must be.Oh this better just be quick Jess said to herself.Florida was not Indiana that much could be said for sure. In Indiana nobody rallied in the streets to celebrate death day or whatever it was they had going on. It was some festival Jess had seen the advertisements plastered all over the small community before arriving in the center of the town. People were dressed up in an odd assortment of clothing. Jess could have sworn they were celebrating Halloween.Despite the exhilarating crowd and the many obstaclesmainly consisting of people throwing food in her face to test outJess found exactly what she wanted surrounded by what she disliked more than most things. There Pierce Oliviera was right in the middle of Isla Huesos chatting it up with a cheerleader.Just like that the fear Jess had harbored about Pierce being in mortal peril vanquished. She got kidnapped for thisPierce was still talking with the cheerleader. Jess suddenly became aware that this cheerleader was also fitting the Halloween spirit splattering her outfit with fake blood. However dead cheerleaders brought back less than happy memories for Jess so she quickly brought her attention to the task at hand.Scanning the crowd she found what she was looking for. Assuming that Pierce had run off on her own and came back for a friendly visit Jess suspected that the guy from her dream would be nearby. Guys who get girls to runaway from home without a trace were typically clinging and possessive enough to not let the girl of their dreams out of sight for too long. He was brooding in a corner. He was tall and strong taller and stronger than Rob was and definitely more brutal looking than Jeff Day.And kept his eyes pierced on well Pierce.This wouldnt be any easy rescue mission.She couldnt just swoop in grab Pierce and get out without anyone noticing. No one could notice because then Jess would be the girl who found Pierce Oliviera all the way in Florida. Pierces name was already flooded in the press. Her rescuer would be too. And how could Jess say she just happened to find Pierce who lived all the Florida when she had been in all the way not in FloridaThe Spark Reignites Lightning Girl Returns She could envision the headlines already. And she really really didnt want headlines. This was going to stay out of the press and Jess was going to stay under the radar the way she liked it.The idea came to her when someone thrust a Capns Morgans Ra Ra Raspberry Whiskey Wonder into her hand and walked away before she could decline. And then she found herself much closer to a now cheerleaderless Pierce than she intended.Ohmigod I am so sorry Look at the mess I made Here let me help you clean that up Jess exclaimed much more enthusiastically than was needed as she looked at the huge red stain taking over Pierces shirt. She gripped her elbow and pulled her into the bathroom slamming the door behind them. And locking it for good measure. Then situating herself in front of it.Its really not that big of a deal Pierce said eyeing the bathroom. She didnt wait for Jess to help her with the shirt and began matting the stain down with water.Use this Jess handed her the TidetoGo she carried around with her. What She used to work the steam table at Joe Jr.s and had become very acquainted with ruined clothing. Old habits die hard. I know your shirt isnt a big deal but running away from home Thats pretty significant.The easer pen felt on the floor. Pierce whirled around looking defeated when she realized Jess was blocking her exit.Its not like thatJess rolled her eyes. I dont care what its like Pierce. But your parents do. And they called me so I could bring you home. So lets get a move on.Pierce shook her head looking like shes about to burst into tears.I already went home okay Theyll know Im safe now.How old was this girl anyway Jess wondered. She looked to be at least sixteen seventeen probably not eighteen but she was acting about twelve.Look Pierce I want to help you out. And you gotta go home. You cant runaway with some guyHes not just some guy She shouted sounding hysterical. I love him not that its any of your business. She said the last part a bit shortly. She stood up straight walking closer to Jess. She had to be at least five inches taller but that wasnt much to brag about. Size did not intimidate Jess Mastriani. Jess had been beating the crap out of people double her stature since kindergarten in order to cower to this girl. Though as of recent years she had retired her physical enforcements replacing them with more diplomatic ways.That didnt mean she wouldnt punch the girl in throat if the circumstance called for it.Im sure you love him Jess agreed toying with then ends of her hair. God she couldnt wait to get married and get a hair cut. The Florida humidity was not being kind to her longer locks.Pierce must have sensed the sarcasm in her voice. No you dont get it. We love each other. Hes protecting me.Let me guessed he asked you to runaway with him Jess needed to shake this girls idea.Pierce swallowed hard. Well not exactly.Well this was getting interesting. So he took you against your willPierce didnt answer. She couldnt even look Jess in the eye anymore.Its just I knew where he was going to take me and I didnt like it the last time I was there. She admitted but I like there now. It suits our relationship if you really think about because I wasnt sure about him at first but now I am. I love him. She seemed a bit embarrassed at her sudden rush of words.Jess gave Pierce an incredulous look. Okay Pierce that is very heartfelt but lets get this show on the road. Cmon.You dont understand This time Pierce was hysterical. I cant go back. I have to do this. I cant go back to them. Its dangerous. I told Uncle Chris that. He understands.Jess grabbed Pierces wrist and opened the door. Try not to make a scene. And then they were back at the fiesta.Stop Pierce begged although not loud enough to draw attention. You dont understand. John will be mad. Nothing and I mean nothing will stop him from finding me Youre only putting yourself in danger She tried to pull her arm away but Jess was expecting that only holding tighter.You dont get it Pierce repeated for what had to the millionth time. If you dont let me go hes going to hurt you.Sounds like you got yourself a real catch Jess answered in return. She may have caught a glimpse of the wellbuilt man but that hardly phased Jess. She hadnt gotten struck by lightning almost gotten her head bashed in inside of a cave took on a psycho football player raided a notorious white supremacists headquarters sought out terrorists throughout the Middle East and busted an underage porn ring to be scared off by some teenagers angry boyfriend.Hes trying to protect me she sniffed. You just dont understand. You cant let yourself get caught up in my mess. I dont want you to get hurt too.Jess didnt care to continue the conversation. Instead she brought Pierce into an alley where she could get through the crowd of people easier and get this kid to police cruiser that had to be lurking around due to the massive festival going down.Of course that was before Jess realized she walked straight into six foot three inches of massive chaos.John Well at least Pierce sounded relieved.,Teen And Up Audiences,Not Found
https://archiveofourown.org/works/27848862,The Girl I Like Is My Sanctuary,My mom was laughing at me.Oh she might think she was hiding it but I could tell. Just because she wasnt actually laughing out loud didnt mean she wasnt laughing. But then it wasnt really anything new for me. My mom had been laughing at me a lot lately sometimes out loud usually silently. And always for the same reason.Mastriani.I know this is just ink on a paper or text on a computer screen or something but please read that word with a full mental growl. And a glare. And maybe an armcrossing.Yeah. Now try it again.Mastriani.Quite possibly the bane of my existence certainly the reason my mom always laughs at me a very big thorn in my side at times the most annoying human being Ive ever met psychic not very girly too young for me in the eyes of the law too good for me in the eyes of most people in my town and my girlfriend.Thats her. Jess.Only I prefer saying Mastriani to saying Jess because Mastriani is just as a word so much easier to say angrily to growl out to scold with to yell and you get the point. Jess is more suited to saying nice things like declaring my feelings.And I cant do that.See the whole name issue aside from the fact that Jess very often needs to be yelled at really stems from the my feelings thing. And the eyes of the law thing. And the previously unmentioned Im irrationally scared of myselfJess thing.Because well The thing is Im pretty sure that Im only two steps away from falling in love with Jess. And thats illegal. And kind of terrifying.Which is why I was planning on breaking up with Jess that night.Of course that night was Thanksgiving. And somehow during a particularly stupid moment Id invited her over for dinner.Which meant I would be breaking up with her on Thanksgiving after inviting her over to my house to eat with my family or at least my mom and her boyfriend and dont even get me started on him which I was fully aware was a very shitty thing to do.Actually I hadnt even really been the one to invite Jess. I mean I physically told her she was invited but Mom was the one who originally offered. She actually really likes Jess and she told her too when Jess showed up just before dinner toting flowers and smiling at us.We just dont see enough of you. Do we Rob Mom had said somewhat pointedly as she let Jess in. She was of course completely ignoring the fact that even seeing Jess rarely on occasions like Thanksgiving was still illegal for me. Technically I guess I could invite her over and it would be fine but I knew very well that no kind of encouragement I gave Jess would be interpreted as just the friendly kind. Granted she had good reason to interpret it differently but still.Moms comment and the fact that Gary had already been there for about half an hour didnt exactly ease my guilty conscience instead I just got more sullen and glared at Jess. You could have called I told her grumpily Id have come and picked you up.She waved my comment away figuratively of course. Why should you have gone to all that trouble My mom was fine with me taking the car.If anything that annoyed me even more. Mastriani I said and just like I said before it was much easier to sound scathing saying Mastriani than it would be if Id said Jess I think youre forgetting something.What Jess asked me confused as Mom headed off to put the flowers in a vase.You dont have a license.Jess rolled her eyes and followed Mom and that pretty much set the tone for the entire dinner. Oh dont get me wrong. Everyone else had a great time. It was just me that was not at all happy. And for some reason Mom interpreted the cause for my anger to be nervousness.Which brings me back to my original statement my mom was laughing at me.She even took time away from Gary and Jess to talk to me before dinner while I was in the kitchen getting the drinks. Or tried to anyway. Normally I like talking with my mom but Jess is one topic I dont like discussing with anyone. Especially since Mom actually liked her.And since right that second as I was pondering all of this she was complimenting my mothers pumpkin pie.Gosh Mrs. Wilkins Mastriani said That was the best pumpkin pie I ever had.You really think so Jess Mom asked. I knew that the praise meant a lot to her since she hardly ever cooks for anyone other than me. And of course the fact that Jesss parents owned a restaurant and were pretty famous around town for their cooking had something to do with it.Yes maam Jess said sincerely. Who could blame her My Moms pie really is amazing. Better than my dads even.Well I doubt that.And then Gary had to butt into the conversation. Isnt your dad a gourmet cookAsshole.Okay so maybe he didnt deserve that. But a lot of the things Gary says make me think asshole. They didnt at first. I actually liked him at first. Back when we were just coworkers. Before I introduced him to my mom.Well Jess said not seeming to mind the comment as much as me I dont know about gourmet. But hes a good cook. Still his pumpkin pie cant hold a candle to yours Mrs. Wilkins.See there was another problem. Jess liked my mom too. They actually got along very well. And I know that Jess genuinely liked her because she doesnt do idle flattery. Not unless shes being sarcastic.Kinda like me actually.Go on Mom said blushing. Me Better than a gourmet cook I dont think so. She wasnt being fakemodest. Shes just unaware of how truly amazing her pumpkin pie is.Sure is good enough for me asshole Gary said and he started dancing with her.Ugh.Im not stupid believe me. My mom hasnt been married to my dad since I was six shes bound to have dated people. And she has. Ive met them before.But I never introduced her to any of them. And none of them ever came over for Thanksgiving dinner. Actually this was both my moms and my first time to invite people over. Which kind of says something doesnt itI left the room. I couldnt take it any more. And not just Gary either. Jess. I know I invited her and everything but I wasnt exactly feeling happy about having her over. Especially since I needed to break up with her soon. Soon being sometime before she went home.I flopped down on the couch in the living room and turned on the TV glaring at it without really processing the images. I could hear happy voices in the background and they just pissed me off even more.And then Jess came in.Hey She stood there looking at me for a moment then sighed and sat down next to me. Why so glum chumIt finally occurred to me that I was watching football a sport I am not fond of and I changed the channel. Nothing.Is it Gary Jess asked. I thought you liked him.God this was awful. She had the incredibly annoying ability to get right to the heart of things. Not all the time and she couldnt usually tell what I was thinking from my face which I am incredibly grateful for most of the time since a lot of it usually involves her but tonight at least she had gotten part of it on the first try.I flipped through the channels faster barely even pausing long enough to see what new channel Id landed on before switching it again. Hes all right. Please please drop it Jess.Then whats the matter She asked and I snapped without thinking.Nothing I told you.Oh.Great now I felt even more like a jackass. It wasnt Jesss fault I was in such a bad mood. Well it sort of was but not in that she caused it just that I was upset about her. And I had to admit Gary too.But I couldnt apologize because then shed just ask again. Jess can be a lot like one of those dogs you know the little ones that bite your ankle or pants or something and just hang on and refuse to let go even when youre shaking them around the room.So I just sat there in silence flicking through the channels and trying not to feel guilty or hear the sounds from the kitchen. But when I heard the playful splashing coming from the kitchen I just had to let some of it out. And besides Jess wanted to know rightIts just I said still staring at the TV though Id stopped changing channels. Animal Planet. A cheetah was chasing some kind of gazelle. she has to work tomorrow thats all. I mean the whole reason we stayed here instead of going to Evansville with my uncle is that she had to work tomorrow. And I got the feeling Mom wanted an excuse to stay so that she could have Gary over for dinner. But that wasnt the point.Oh Jess said again quietly and I started flipping through the channels again.I just hope he isnt planning on staying late. Moms got the breakfast shift.Of course Jess probably knew this seeing as her dad owned the restaurant my mom worked at but again that wasnt the point. I was venting. Maybe it was pretty bad of me to vent to the girl I was planning on breaking up with sometime within the next hour or so but I was too angry to really care.Im sure hes going to leave soon Jess said with a smile which just made me feel guiltier. Hey why dont we volunteer to do the dishes so they can you know visitVisit.I made a face at that but I turned the TV off and stood up anyway. It wasnt like I was watching it or anything. But when we got into the kitchen it was pretty obvious that Mom and Gary didnt exactly mind being left to do the dishes. They were both grinning and there were suds everywhere.Mom I said notquite gritting my teeth. Isnt that your good dressOh yes it is. Mom looked around Where is my apron Oh I left it in my bedroomIll get it Jess offered and I might have been suspicious of her wanting to snoop of course she did were it not for my Mom.Oh arent you sweet She asked and sprayed Gary right in the chest.I felt ill.After Jess had gone and a small fight over the nozzle had ended Gary turned to me and asked So thats your girlfriendNow I really regretted ever mentioning her to him at work. I hadnt thought theyd ever meet. Of course Id also never thought he would ask out my mother so I guess all bets were off now. I just nodded.He grinned at me. Gary had a tendency to do that as though we were friends. We hadnt even been friends before he started dating my mother just coworkers and now now it was out of the question. But he didnt seem to get that. Well congratulations.I had to physically try not to clench my hands into fists. I stuffed them into my pockets instead. CongratulationsGary grinned again and winked at me. Yeah. Youve got yourself a real catch there just make sure you dont let her get away.Considering everything that was very possibly the worst thing he could have said to me. I bit my cheek so as not to say anything and just nodded stiffly. After a couple more seconds during which I didnt say a word Gary started talking to Mom again leaving me to simmer on my own.How dare he I hadnt asked for his opinion I could let Jess get away I could throw her back in if I wanted And what was with that stupid fish metaphor anyway How did that even start AssholeMom was laughing at some joke of Garys when Jess walked back in and luckily my Mom took the time to look at my face and see that I wasnt exactly having fun so she said Rob why dont you show Jessica the progress youve made on your bikeI have no proof that she realized that she was basically inviting us to go make out but I have a sneaking suspicion she did. As I said my mom really likes Jess and she trusts me enough to be okay with it.Well it was either that or she wanted time alone with Gary and that idea was just disturbing.So I led Jess out there silently and then I started to work on my Harley a little. Jess kind of watched me for a few minutes and then she said Is this just because I drove hereI blinked up at her. For the few brief seconds I had gotten to work on the bike all my guilt and anger had melted away. Id almost forgotten she was here. What are you talking aboutThis Jess said I mean if Id known you were going to be so crabby about it Id have called you to pick me up I swear.This instantly made me angry and stressed again. Partially because it reminded me I was breaking up with her tonight and that this was probably the best time but also because it reminded me of something else. A phone call Id overheard.Yeah. I didnt mention that did I Didnt mention that Id walked past the kitchen when she was on the phone with her mom assuring her that she was safely at her friends house but warning her that Joanne refused to let her just take the history notes so she had to stay here while she copied them andThat was when Id walked away.No you wouldnt have I said twisting the wrench.What are you talking about I just said I sighed. You didnt even tell your parents you were coming here Mastriani I said not looking at her. So cut the crap.What do you mean She asked. They know where I am.I put down the wrench at that knowing that if I tried to continue working on my bike during this conversation Id probably break something. I folded my arms and looked her right in the eyes. Then why when you called to tell them you got here did you say you were at somebody named JoannesI could see Jesss face fall as she realized I knew shed been lying to me. Yeah that had hurt by the way the lying. Id actually thought at firstRight. Time to do it then.Look Mastriani I said flatly You know Ive had my doubts from the start about this you and me I mean. And not just because Ive graduated and youre still in the eleventh grade not to mention the whole jailbait factor. But lets be real. You and I come from different worlds.Jess looked outraged. That is so not I interrupted her. Well different sides of the tracks then.Just because Im a Townie she said and youre a I interrupted her again trying to ignore the memory of Gary saying Make sure you dont let her get away or my Moms words in the kitchen before Id managed to escape I just wanted to say that I know things have to be difficult for you with Jessica but I think you made the right choice. You two are made for eachother Rob and Im glad youre willing to fight for that.I held up a hand. Look Mastriani. Cold distant and blunt. Lets face it. This isnt going to work.Jesss face went blank and for a minute I thought that it was all over with.And I wondered just how this had happened. I mean I wasnt lying earlier I really did have my doubts about the two of us but even so I had been willing to fight for it in Moms words. I had been optimistic about it just a few months ago. How had that turned into thisIt was stupid of me to ask because I already knew. It was yes a variety of things the jailbait thing the different sides of the tracks thing the her not introducing me to anyone in her family or even telling them I existed thing that were all pretty big deals but mostly it had to do with the fact as Id said earlier that I was only about two steps away from being completely and utterly in love with her and that was really not a good thing.But then Jesss face went from blank to angry and she put her hands on her hips and cocked her head to the side. I was suddenly a little afraid.Does this have something to do with that Gary dudeI turned back to the bike. Why couldnt she just leave now No. This is between you and me Mastriani.Jess ignored me. Because I noticed you dont seem to like him very much.I closed my eyes trying very very hard to stay calm. Youre sixteen years old. SixteenJess continued ignoring me speaking very calmly. I mean I guess I could understand why you dont like him. It must be weird to see your mom with some guy other than your dad. But that doesnt mean its okay to take it out on me.I still couldnt look at her but I had to at least try. Jess. Youve got to see that this cant go anywhere. Im on probation okay I cant get caught hanging out with some kid I know that had to hurt but when she interrupted me Jesss voice didnt sound at all mad. I kind of wished she were. I would have preferred it if she just punched me as she is known to do to guys that annoy her and stormed out.What I hear you saying She said calmly is that you dont want to see me anymore because you feel that our age and socioeconomic differences are too great Dont even tell me you dont agree I warned her Otherwise why havent you told your parents about me Huh Why am I this dark secret in your life If you were so sure that we have something that could work youd have introduced me to them by now.I hadnt meant to sound so bitter but it didnt matter anyway Jess just ignored me again.What I am saying to you in response is that I believe you are pushing me away because your father hurt you and you cant stand to be hurt that way again. What I turned my head to look at her over my shoulder. She looked serious. I said the first thing that came to mind. Youre nuts.Jess just took a step closer shaking her head. Rob she said I just want you to know I am not like your dad. I will never leave you.Where the hell was she getting this Because youre a freaking psycho I told her but she still didnt get angry.What the hellNo Jess said as I turned around fully to look at her. Maybe shed hit her head on something coming into the barn. Why else would she be acting so weird Thats not why. Its because I lo Two steps away. Dont I shouted suddenly realizing what she was about to say and feeling completely frozen with fear. I shoved the rag I use to wipe off my hands after working on the Harley out in front of me as if it could shield me from what she was about to say. Dont say it Mastriani I am warning you It was a feeble attempt to distance myself from her from the whole situation and of course it didnt work. Jess just continued on like Id never spoken. Again.ve you.I wadded up the useless rag and threw it across the barn not looking at her. I told you not to say it.It. I love you. She had told me she loved me. Jess Mastriani had just told me Rob Wilkins that she loved me.Im sorry Jess said perfectly innocently. But I am afraid my unbridled passion was simply too great to hold in check a moment longer.She loved me. One step. I couldnt help it I reached out grabbed her by the shoulders and yanked her towards me until I could reach her lips and start kissing her.And kissing her. She loved me. My eyes were closed and I wasnt aware of anything else in the world at that moment. I was kissing her and that was all that mattered. I didnt care that I had been trying to break up with her. I didnt care that I had plenty of perfectly good reasons to do so. I didnt even care that we were getting more and more into the kissing and it was not only against the law but my mom knew we were out there and besides we were in a barn in the middle of the night in November and I had never planned on getting very far with Jess.But Jess did. The next time we pulled back for a moment to breathe she said I think I should go home now.I didnt want to stop kissing her. I didnt want her to go home. She loved me. I did not want her to go.But she was right. I rested my forehead on hers staring into her eyes and still breathing hard from the combined effects of our kissing and the shock of hearing that she loved meI couldnt stop saying it to myself.That I told her still panting would probably be a good idea.I waited outside while Jess went inside to say goodbye to my mom. I didnt want to spoil the moment by seeing Gary. I was no longer upset. Confused yes and having no idea where this was going but not upset. How could I beWell Jess told me as she got into her moms car Seeing as how we arent broken up anymore do you want to do something Saturday Like go see a movie or whateverI knew she was making fun of me and I needled her right back but I wasnt annoyed Gosh I dont know. I thought you might be busy with your good friend Joanne.Look Jess said My parents have a lot to deal with right now. I mean theres the restaurant and Mike dropping out of HarvardOkay now I was kind of annoyed. Youre never going to tell them about me are youJess couldnt quite meet my gaze. Just let me give them a chance to adjust to the idea. I mean theres the whole thing with Douglas and his job and Greataunt Rose and And you and the psychic thing I added not too bitterly. I didnt resent it for nearly killing her several times or anything. Dont forget you and the psychic thing.Right Jess said. Me and the psychic thing. She sounded just a tinge bitter too.Look I said straightening up. you better get going. Ill follow behind and make sure you get home okay.You dont have to Jess started but I cut her off.Mastriani I said but this time I was smiling. Just shut up and drive.For once she listened and I followed in a very good mood.She loved me.,Teen And Up Audiences,RetellingPOV Rob WilkinsRacism
https://archiveofourown.org/works/27843667,The Girl I Like Was Struck By Lightning,Mastriani Well duh you havent seen her in classes shes only 16 not a senior. You didnt seriously think she was did youI do have detention a lot and I admit I flunked Health the first time around because I never paid attention but generally I like to think Im a pretty smart guy. But sometimes I do something so incredibly stupid that I cant help but wonder if those Townies are right about us Grits being as dumb as the livestock some of us own.This happened to be one of those times.You see I had finally made a move and asked out this girl Jess Mastriani. Well I guess finally isnt exactly the word I havent really even liked her for a long time. I mean I noticed her before like last semester in Health. She sat in front of me and occasionally Kurt and I would talk and shed butt in with her own comments but for the most part she never really stood out on my radar.But then I got detention for two weeks because of that time Id left in second period to go help Chick out at the bar because he was sick rather than stay for math. And I saw her in there up ahead of me in the auditorium.I cant say that I was entirely surprised I mean any Townie girl who will actually carry out a conversation with the two Grits behind her about motorcycles lets just say I knew from then on that Jess wasnt much like most other girls.Well it was that and her tendency to just wear tshirts and jeans and not dress up not wear makeup and have very short probably easytomanage hair unlike other girls.Not that I watched her frequently or anything Im just a guy. We tend to notice when certain girls stick out.So anyway Id never really been interested in going out with Jess just mildly interested in why she was so well different. But then when I saw her in detention combined with what I already knew about her I kind of thought why notI guess it didnt really hurt that she was really hot.So I offered to give her a ride after detention. She refused apparently preferring to walk through what must be several miles of rain with her weird friend to getting a simple ride from me which annoyed me for a while until I realized that she probably hadnt refused because I was a Grit and more because she didnt want to leave her friend alone.Of course I realized this right about the same time that I noticed it was tornado weather outside and I got really worried for a little while. Sure there wasnt really much I could have done to get them out of the way of the storm my Indian good as Id fixed it up simply cannot fit three passengers but Id just left them there.Im pretty sure Mom wouldnt be very happy with me.But luckily the storm cleared up really soon and there wasnt too much damage so I figured they would probably have been okay. Besides I was a little busy at the time. The truck had been parked outside and hail had smashed the windshield in so I had to take it down to my uncles garage and fix it.I admit I still felt a little worried but all my fears relaxed when I saw Jess in detention the next day. Well actually more than saw her Miss Clemmings moved her to the back to sit right in the middle of the Ws I guess to keep us from fighting.Which was probably a good move. Miss Clemmings is pretty tiny and isnt equipped to keep us from fighting or even talking like shes supposed to. And yeah looking at her you wouldnt guess that Jess would be able to stop any of us either but if youd been in the cafeteria a few days ago youd have seen that shes got a pretty good right hook which is why she ends up in detention in the first place because she goes around punching people who insult her family or just really piss her off.Anyway Miss Clemmings pointed Jess back here to the Ws row because well I really dont like some of these people no matter if we occasionally hang out and it hasnt helped that Ive been forced to sit next to Wendell and Wylie for an hour every day.So half the row moved over for her everyone past me because she was taking my seat and she sat down. Everyone else was groaning and complaining pretty loudly but I cant say I really minded. Sure I had to move but it meant Id at least get the chance to actually ask her out.Welcome to hell I said when she sat down glad to see I still warranted a grin even after driving off yesterday. Of course as soon as she smiled that idiot Wylie had to grab his crotch and leer at us prompting me to threaten him Youre dead Wylie.See how fights break outMiss Clemmings said Shhh and clapped her hands whispering If I hear another word back there youre all getting an extra week in a way that was probably meant to be threatening but came across as more scolding like youd talk to naughty four yearolds in a daycare.Still we all listened mostly because we knew shed carry out her threat and then wed end up spending another week next to eachother. Of course we usually all had an extra week by the time two days had gone by anyway my original twoweek sentence was already five weeks long by that time and I still had two more left but we tried to avoid it.Wendell went back to playing with his paper football and all the other Ws went back to what theyd been doing before Jess had come down although some of them had to start over whatever theyd been scratching into their seats. I however didnt bother to go back to my spy novel. Id already read it anyway and I was too busy watching Jess pretending to watch the play rehearsal.But it was Endgame I wasnt exactly interested in it not when Jess was sitting right there anyway. I watched her for a few minutes she was doing some sort of homework. I think shes the only person in detention who consistently behaves well all she ever does is sit there and do homework or watch the plays. Its just another aspect of the mystery that is Mastriani she does enough to get detention every day for pretty much all of the school year but when shes actually in detention shes a model citizen.After a few minutes I decided there really was no better time than now we dont share any classes and shes always with her friend after detention and reached over to grab her book nodding at the geometry shed been doing before turning to a new page and writing her a note. So did you get caught in the rain yesterdayJess took the notebook and her pen back glancing up at Miss Clemmings like she was worried shed be caught. But really there was no punishment for notepassing in detention. Its not like passing notes is worth a detention normally not unless you do it all the time and always get caught and usually the detention monitors just grateful you arent talking out loud and disturbing whatever play is getting practiced at the moment.After a very long pause she handed the notebook and pen back with a short reply Yes.Yeah youre so encouraging Mastriani. I mean if it werent for the way shed smiled at me earlier Id have thought she was still mad and didnt want to talk to me.Maybe I could have phrased asking her out better than I did like simply asking if she wanted to go out but I never said I was perfect. I wrote back Told you so. Why dont you ditch the fat girl and come for a ride with me after thisThe moment she finished reading that she froze completely for a second with a really weird look on her face then started scribbling furiously. After a few seconds she passed the paper back. Are you mentally impaired or something That fat girl happens to be my best friend.I couldnt help but grin even though shed just insulted me. That was a big part of why I liked her her fire. And I had insulted her best friend. But that I didnt exactly feel sorry for unlike Mastriani her chubby friend was typical of all the other Townies in one very important factor she looked down on all Grits.I quickly wrote a reply Jesus sorry. I had no idea you were so sensitive. Let me rephrase. Why dont you tell your gravitationally challenged friend to take a hike and come for a ride with me after thisMastriani took a moment to reply then passed the notebook and pen back again. She didnt notice Wendell raising an eyebrow behind her or me glaring at him. Luckily he didnt say anything for once showing some sense. I took her note and read it with a sinking heart. Its Friday night you loser. What do you think I dont already have plans I happen to have a boyfriend you know.Okay she was definitely not being very encouraging smile earlier or no. But I wasnt ready to give up for several reasons. One she didnt really look angry or anything while writing this to the contrary she actually had a little smile curling her lips. Two there was the matter of my pride if I just quit now it would be pretty embarrassing and besides she seemed to be almost challenging me and Three something told me she didnt really have a boyfriend.So I wrote back something I knew shed appreciate being a motorcycle buff Yeah Well I bet your boyfriend isnt rebuilding a 64 Harley in his barn.I could practically see her begin to drool at the mention of the Harley but she quickly wrote back My boyfriend doesnt have a barn. His dad is a lawyer.Yeah somehow I was still doubting that right up until the point I remembered that there was a pretty good lawyer in town Mr. Abramowitz whod helped my mom with her divorce. Didnt he have a son about our age But I shook it off. I was probably making connections that didnt exist. So Dump him. Come for a ride. It was a little humiliating how many times Id had to say this especially considering that she was apparently nowhere near agreeing.Maybe that was why I reacted the way I did when Hank started calling Wylie. Wylie and Greg responded with a Suck on this Wendell.But Jess had told them to stop it more precisely Both of you shut the hell up before Clemmings looks over here. And they didnt listen to her. On the contrary Wendell threw his dumb spitandpaper football over to Wylie completely ignoring Mastriani. For some reason this really pissed me off. They just werent treating her with the respect she deserved.I caught the football before Wylie could grab it and told them both in a voice that sounded way more menacing than my normal one You heard the lady. Knock it off.I guess my voice sounded sort of scary to them too or maybe they just didnt want the hassle I dont know but they both quieted down and kind of glanced away ignoring us again. I have to admit I was a little worried when Jess started writing again. Maybe she didnt like me fighting her battle. But really they were both twice her size and anyway My thoughts were interrupted by Jess passing me the notebook and pen again. Okay it said On one condition.No conditions. I was seriously through with all this crap. I mean I just wanted to ask her out Why couldnt she just give me a simple yesShe started to write something back THEN I CANT GO but I grabbed the notebook before she was done angrily scribbling out All right.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/27848634,The Girl I Like Needs A Safe House,She was home for three days before I even knew she was here.Jess Mastriani of course is the she. She didnt come home after that camp because she went to Ruths summer home and I guess once she was gone I just lost track of the time. So I didnt realize when she got home.Oh sure that shouldnt be a big deal. I know that. Why should I care that I missed her for three days After all it wasnt like I was still in high school anymore. I had no reason to know that school was starting.And I hadnt called her house in over a month if fact Id only called it once and that was before I heard about her going with Ruth. Once I heard I decided Id just wait until she got home and then she could call me.Jess was always the one who called me before why should it be any different nowI had honestly expected that as soon as Jess got back shed call me or come down to the garage and say hi like she used to last spring. So it came as a big shock to me when I heard shed been back for three days.Of course maybe it had something to do with the way I found out. Yeah my mom told me in the middle of dinner completely nonchalantly.Actually shed said in the middle of a story about work and how the head chef always arranges the toppings on a pizza for a certain table into a heart if a couple sits there because its the most romantic spot in Mastrianis my mom works there as a waitress That reminds me You know who I saw there todayI just looked at her highly doubting Id be interested in who came and sat at the Date Table as its apparently called. And I wasnt not when she started talking anyway.She was there with this nice boy. He was very polite. I just nodded not really paying attention taking another bite of my spaghetti. And of course the moment I started chewing Mom added I just thought might mention that Id seen Jess that is how she prefers to be called right Jess It was really nice to see her again. I can see why you like her.I choked on my food and started coughing heavily. What Jess Why Mom just smiled innocently at me when I finally managed to stop coughing. I stared at her suspiciously. I had no idea what she was thinking my mom can keep a perfectly blank face when she wants to a talent Ive inherited. Its nice and all and a lot of the time very useful around Jess but its a little annoying when she turns it around on me because it always seems like she can see right through me.Mastrianis back When when did that happen Did she call while I was at workMom shook her head smiling at me with something like pity. No honey she hasnt called. And I dont know when she got back but Ernie Pyle started yesterday on Monday Rob.But she wait I was completely confused. It was Tuesday late Tuesday night my mom works the dinner shift so we eat our dinner late. Are you sure she didnt callMom shook her head.Oh I sighed with a sinking heart. Okay. So Jess had finally given up. That that was fine. Really. I was just It wasnt exactly Oh god I just hadnt expected her I hadnt actually wanted her toBut it was a good thing that she had. I couldnt try to stop her or anything. That would be well it would be pretty stupid of me. I mean Id just gotten exactly what Id been trying for for almost a year now Mastriani to leave me alone.So why did it hurt so muchI nodded. Oh Thats cool. Thanks for you know letting me know.Mom smiled at me amused and we went back to eating dinner and chatting about various things. After dinner I washed the dishes and then I went up to my room planning on reading a new spy novel. But something kept nagging at me.For the longest time I had no idea what it was. I finally had to throw down the book and go out into the barn to work on the 64 Harley Ive been rebuilding. Its almost done but tinkering with bikes always relaxes me. I was hoping at the time that working on it would help me figure out what was bothering me.And okay the moment I walked into the barn I thought of Jess but that was just because Id had to spend the night out in the barn with Sean Patrick OHanahan the first kid shed ever found last spring.And really a lot of things make me think of Jess lately. I cant go to work without being reminded of the times shed come and visit me sitting on a tool bench and talking to my boots as I worked on a car occasionally handing me tools. Every time I get on my Indian my mind snaps to her riding it behind me for a few seconds until I manage to shake it off. Driving past Lumbley Lane well thats obvious. Eating in the kitchen I remember the time she ate breakfast here hell even in my bedroom I cant help but be reminded of her because she slept in my bed one night the night when Sean and I slept in the barn.So when I thought about Jess as soon as I started working on the Harley I didnt think it was anything really. I mean okay so shed finally given up on the idea of going out with me. And I was upset about that. But I could accept it. It was fine even if it hadnt really sunk in yet. That wasnt what was niggling at me annoying me and making me feel like Id missed something.Id finished working on the bike for the night it was getting late technically tomorrow already and gone inside to take a shower by that point still thinking hard.But what else could it be Aside from the fact that Mastriani was back and was no longer interested in dating there wasnt any wait a minute.Dating. The Date Table. She was there with this really nice boy Wait a minute. Mastriani was back okay so I could handle that. She didnt didnt like me anymore That that one I wasnt doing so good with but I could deal really. ButShe was already dating other people Other guys How could sheI mean the entire reason Id been so relaxed about her still in high school where there were plenty of single guys her age was because none of them liked her Not that Id really be able to do anything if they had butShe went out with another guyThat was what I asked my mom once I finished my shower and got dressed although not in those words.Hey Mom I said glad she hadnt gone to sleep yet. Normally she would have but I guess she was off tomorrow.Yeah What is it RobShe was reading a book in bed and she folded it closed looking at me as she waited for me to continue. I cleared my throat awkwardly. Uh you said you saw J Mastriani today rightShe nodded starting to smile. I looked at my feet. So uh didnt you mention something about She was uh with somebodyI looked up when she answered then glanced away at the wall embarrassed. Thats right Mom smiled. A nice young boy I put them at the Date Table.Date Table. Right.Okay I said. Thats all Uh good night Mom.When I looked at her she looked as if she was trying not to laugh.I closed the door and went to my room where I stood frozen for about two minutes until I couldnt handle it anymore.I was gone before another five minutes had passed driving down the dark highway toward her house.I was going to pay Jess a little visit.,Teen And Up Audiences,RetellingPOV Rob Wilkins
https://archiveofourown.org/works/27848478,The Girl I Like Is Code Named Cassandra,It didnt work.Maybe I should have expected it Mastriani had already proven to me that she wasnt just taking no for an answer. But I mean her plan had worked. Her plan to rescue a kid and his mom from the Feds and hide her own psychic powers so theyd leave her alone too. And well it was a good plan really it was but it wasnt like shed even planned her plan.Well you know what I mean.Her plan was a spurofthemoment idea that got out of hand and we were incredibly lucky that it had worked at all. But my plan the one Id worried about and tortured myself over for weeks didnt work.Now how is that fairYeah yeah I know. Life isnt fair. Ive known that ever since I was six and my dad left us. Which also happened to be the year I attended first grade and found out that in this town all men are not created equal. No here were delegated into two very separate groups Grits and Townies.The Grits are kids like me who grew up outside of town limits and never went to preschool. Kids whose parents work at the plastics factory or at least until recently when it shut down and who speak in more pronounced southern accents than Townies. Grits are people like me who dont want to go to college and work at a garage for a living and intend to keep right on doing so. Grits are the ones who wear cheaper clothes and ride on Harleys or in old Toyota pickups rather than their brand new Ferraris or Porsches. Were the ones that are seen as less educated less intelligent less worldly less political less capable of taking care of ourselves and overall just less than the Townies.Then of course theres the Townies. The positive to our negative. The doctors and lawyers and the people who fired our parents from the plastics factory. Townies are the kids in school who are noticed and praised and popular. The cheerleaders the football players the drama club the band geeks and the science prodigies you name it theres a Townie. Except for one place. Detention. Sure occasionally some of the jocks got thrown in there for minor infractions but us Grits are the only ones who consistently stay there. Thats our territory and thats the way its always been. Because no matter how much the Townies look down on us we think theyre just as bad and we resent them. Sometimes even enough to act like they expect us to which leads to them treating us even more that way which provokes us more Its a vicious circle.Or at least it was until Jess.Jess was always different than the rest of the Townies you could tell that just by looking at her. Mainly looking at her punching a football star because he insulted her friend something that no other Townie would ever dare do.It was that very action in fact that led to me meeting her. She and I had just got out of detention and were walking home when I offered her a ride. Because I recognized that she was different and I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt and do what no Grit had ever done before ask a Townie out on a date.Well okay maybe its happened before. But I highly doubt any Townie has said yes before. Oh no. But Jess yeah she didnt mind. Didnt mind at all.Of course then she got struck by lightning and developed psychic powers and I found out she was only sixteen and therefore jailbait to my eighteen and never asked her out again. Not that that stopped me from blowing up a helicopter and breaking into a secure military facility for her or anything.Yeah. Jess Mastriani was weird like that. She made me do things.Things like watching her rather than the plays being performed in front of me each afternoon in detention like she thought I was and daydreaming about the three kisses weve shared. Things like driving past her house occasionally idling at the top of the street. Things like not telling her to go away.That last one was my big mistake. I mean sure it was my first real crush. Big deal. I would have gotten over it had I just told her flatout to leave me alone.But I never did.Not even when she started showing up sometimes at my uncle Randys garage to talk to me. Shed just walk in look around until she saw me and then shed come over and perch on a workbench or lean on the wall and start talking.Just like that.See and here was where my plan was going wrong. The talking and the visiting at all. Because that meant we were still seeing eachother despite the fact that I was already out of highschool and she was just on her summer vacation. We were still seeing each other and sometimes I gave her rides home and once she kissed me when I dropped her off.And its not like I did anything to stop her either. I mean she didnt exactly pounce on me or anything. I had plenty of time to pull back to put my helmet on again to drive away.But I didnt. I didnt pull away not at first anyway not until after my hands were on her shoulders and hers were around my neck and it was most definitely not the kind of kissing friends do. Not that we were even that.And then all I could seem to say once Id pulled away well more like jerked away was Were not dating in a voice that just like the last time shed kissed me couldnt seem to remain steady.But that was a onetime thing. The visits to the garage were more regular. Well okay they only occurred about three or four times but I think that was only because she left before a month was up.She came to tell me about it. I mean I was working on a car at the time so she was talking more to my boots but she told me all about it. Mastriani was going to some band camp to work as a councilor with here I finally learned the name of her best friend whom up until that point I had referred to only as that fat chick but not to Mastrianis face because you would not believe how sensitive she gets about people insulting her family and friends Ruth where I was informed she would watch over budding musical prodigies as they honed their already considerable skills.I just scooted out from under the Volvo I was fixing and said Oh yeah Well thatll be good for you to get away for a while. Hand me that wrench right there will youWell I wasnt exactly going to start weeping and begging her to stay was I I mean really. The way I thought of the whole thing was if Jess went away to some camp for the summer maybe when she came back she would have well forgotten about me somewhat. And then maybe my plan would start to actually work for the first time since I had concocted it months ago in math class right after Id found out she was only sixteen and my probation officer might have something to say about me dating her.And besides it wasnt like she was going to meet some other guy and run away with him right I mean she was working as a camp councilor. What kind of selfrespecting guy would take that jobYou might be confused what with me talking about ignoring Mastriani forever one second and then worrying about her finding someone else the next. Well I cant exactly help it. I like her okay So sue me. Even if I am the one whos always trying to get rid of her. I still like her. And sometimes I cant exactly control myself.Like when she kisses me.But for the most part that had never been an issue that being my tendency to get very protective of herjealous of other guys. I mean yeah when wed first met there had been that time that I threatened to snap Wendells arm off if he didnt leave her alone but nothing since then.Which I will admit was due mostly to the fact that no other boys in this town seem to have an interest in going out with Mastriani. I cant really see why. She is definitely very hot just not in a conventional way. I mean yeah her hair is even shorter than mine and she wears tshirts and jeans most of the time and she doesnt put on makeup but let me tell you all that works very much in her favor. It makes her genuine unlike everyone else in this damn town. And besides her natural looks are more than good enough.But I guess she drove any potential dates away you know with her attitude. She can be pretty abrasive at times. And then theres the whole punching people issue. And the Lightning Girl thing.But anyway I never ended up jealous or anything because she never went out with anyone else. Which is good. I mean not really because I should want her to go out with other people. I should hope that some other guy some guy her age asks her out and she says yes and they kiss andBut even just writing this is making me really want to go find her and kiss the hell out of her just to prove that she likes me and not him right before I punch his lights out for even thinking he could touch her and he doesnt even existSo it was good that she was going off to camp for several reasons. Not only could I hope that maybe the prolonged absence would make us both stop liking eachother but I also wouldnt have to worry my head off about whether or not she was dropping me for some other guy while she was gone because there wouldnt be any other guys.I never claimed to be logical.But anyway for those reasons I was happy she was going away and also because what I had said was true it would be good for Mastriani to get away for a bit. After the whole Lightning Girl fiasco it might do her some good to lay low for a while away from where it had all occurred.So basically I was happy Jess had gone and I even managed during the first couple of days to stop thinking about her all the time. Maybe if we hadnt contacted each other all summer well maybe I would have stopped liking her. Or at least I like to think so.But it didnt stay that way for long. Because on only the third day after she left she called me.,Teen And Up Audiences,RetellingPOV Rob Wilkins
https://archiveofourown.org/works/41961768,The Accident,As I waited the snow began to fall and I started to regret telling Ruth that I didnt need her to wait with me. I stamped my feet thinking about Rob. His eyeshis shouldershisoops where was I Oh yes Rob and his apparent inability to make it to the student parking lot before the end of school. He was supposed to be picking me up so we could go back to his but he was running late. Again.Finally he dew up beside me . Youre late. Okay so it was a bit harsh but it was freezing out here.He pulled off his helmet and looked at me that familiar smile flickering at the back of his gorgeous eyes. You may not have noticed Mastriani but its snowing. And Im taking you back to your house then going home and bringing the truck back to pick you up. I think I started to protest but its hard to be sure since he grabbed my shoulders and pulled me forward to kiss me hard and then dropped the spare helmet onto my head before I could regain the power of speech.As he did so I heard him murmur Ive been waiting all day for that. Glad to know I wasnt the only one.As we rode through town well under the speed limit for a change I began to see why he was leaving me in town. The streets here were bad enough so who knew what the back roads on the way to Robs would be like.As we started down the hill leading to my street I peered over Robs shoulder at the car smoothed snow and panicked. My psychic powers really do usually extend only to recovering missing children but I was definitely getting bad vibes off of this hill. That was my first mistake. Ignoring the vibes I mean. As we reached a side street half way down a van roared out and Rob slammed on the brakes to avoid hitting it. The wheels locked but the bike spun on the flattened snow and we were both thrown clear of the bike.After that everything became hazy a series of disjointed feelings sounds and images. Robs voice gasping out a panicky Jess the cold snow under my body the sound of a wailing siren a man in a paramedics uniform leaning over me his lips moving noiselessly pain in my leg the feel of a needle sliding into my arm.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/4058347,Imbroglio,I sat in the extremely crowded cafeteria of XX University reading my tablet as I ate my lunch. Of course I dont know why I even bothered reading the news on my device since it consisted of the same type of stories that were being featured for the past month the recent events revolving around the famous players of Life 2.0 namely the champion of the Battle Tournament Yi Min and Prince of Odd Squad. Ever since Infinite City Duel Incident all the media ever talks about is the whereabouts of the famed warriors as they have not logged in since then. This new face of evil in Life 2.0 that player named Fan from Moon City also appeared declaring war on Prince and his domain. This new rebellion as well as Princes lack of presence in the game is tearing the Central Continent apart almost at the brink of a civil warExcuse me Said someone bringing me out of my thoughts. I looked up to see two guys about my age standing in front of my four seat table which I was sitting alone at. One had jet black hair tucked into a baseball cap with glasses that were simply just too large for his face wearing a hoodie that was equally too much for his thin frame. He was on crutches with his left foot in a cast to the middle of his calf making him unable to carry a lunch tray that his friend was carrying for him instead. This friend was taller than him wearing a beanie and black thickrimmed glasses generally more normal looking than his blackhaired counterpart. can we sit here Everywhere else is taken. The black haired guy asked.Uh sure. Dont see any harm in it I replied moving some of my belongings closer to me that I had scattered across the table. They both sat down with the black haired guy resting his crutches against the table. I glanced over at their lunch trays curious as to what they had bought. The first one was pretty simple it had a hamburger fries and a soda on it since today the school was selling American food. When I looked at the other tray which was placed in front of the blackhaired guy I nearly did a double take by the sheer quantity. He had at least three hamburgers two things of fries as well as two slices of pizza as well. He dug in nearly immediately a hamburger in one hand and a slice of pizza in the other. AAre you going to eat all that... I couldnt help but ask.He looked at me inquisitively tilting his head to the side slightly. Hmm yeah. Why Did you want some They still have plenty up thereNo no. Just... Just curious. I replied slightly disturbed. Who could eat that much in one sitting And stay that thin at that Does he have a tapeworm or something I wondered.I returned back to my tablet to look at more news sites as the two ate though as to why I dont know. Every now and then I would sigh out loud as I went to another news feed only to find essentially the same stories once again. Is this what all people care about today Celebrities I mean I never had anything against either Prince or Yi Min so I hope nothing bad happened to them but this is ridiculous. Its been a month now Im sure more has happened outside of a pair of glorified gamers deciding to not play a game for a little bit. Apparently my sighs were not unheard when the black haired guy spoke up Is something wrongHm... I wasnt quite sure if I could speak so shamelessly about two famous players in front of two strangers. But theyre both men so at best they probably idolize or respect them unlike most of the girls here who squeal or faint at the mere sight of them. I reasoned. Well to be honest Im kind of frustrated with the news feeds lately. Its constantly Yi Min this or Prince that as if they are the two most important beings in the world Oddly both of them tensed up with the black haired guy looking anxious. Tch of course no one cares that Zhi Sano disappeared too... the taller guy mumbled before his friend elbowed him in the arm.The black haired guy relaxed a little bit an expression of empathy on his face. I completely agree with you People die every day of wars disease and famine yet all they talk about is silly celebrities The black haired guy gave a small laugh I mean they dont even know what theyre really like in the real worldYeah I mean Yi Min may shamelessly take peoples snacks The taller guy joked which resulted in a strange death glare from the black haired boy. The taller guy seemed to look over past the black haired guy towards the floor squinting his eyes a little bit. Hey I think you dropped some of your changeAgain Asked the black haired boy acting exasperated. Its these damn pants I swear. If it wasnt for my stupid cast I could wear my normal pair... He mumbled as he leaned down towards the floor to pick up the coins.OH MY GAWD ITS HIM ITS REALLY HIM A couple of girls suddenly screamed a couple of tables over from us looking right at the black haired boy. He suddenly shot straight up his hat completely gone and his glasses in his hand. With the hat and glasses gone it exposed his messy jaw length hair and a face that could make any man jealous and any woman lose their composure.No way youre... I mumbled realizing who was actually sitting at my table now.Damn it Feng Wen Your hat fell off again And why did you take your glasses off The taller man griped ripping off his hat and glasses to quickly stow them away in his backpack.Because they would have fallen off as well Hong Peng He replied his eyes growing larger as he saw the girls quickly getting up. Hong Peng hurry you know the plan Feng Wen quickly grabbed his crutches as Hong Peng swung his backpack over his shoulder. In one motion Hong Peng scooped Feng Wen into his arms firemanstyle and preceded to make a dash for the exit. Before they had left the cafeteria I saw Feng Wen wave at me and shout Thank you and nice to meet you by the way,Mature,Action/AdventureDarkOriginally Posted on FanFiction.NetMinor Canonical Character(s)Canon CompliantPost-CanonAmbiguous RelationshipsPOV First PersonPOV Alternating

https://archiveofourown.org/works/27744673,Love Me as Me,Prince sang drunkenly as he wandered the palace halls. He was king. He was alive. The spell of whatever monster he had just slain didnt even have any affects He just felt like he had a night out with Nan Gong Zui so of course he was having a good time before he had to go back to life as XiaoLan. She was boring and pressured and he wasnt ready for that. He wasnt ready to go back to hating mirrors and changing who he was. The notes died in his throat when he saw Gui. Something unfamiliar bubbled inside his chest as he took in the bastard just lounging there as if he hadnt spent the entire week fawning over Prince with purple hair fluttering in the breeze and the cool toned bard armor rippling with every motion and emphasizing his fluid movements. The way he lounged now was a beauty he really got to see more of the cool professor side that made his stomach clench when he said something so profound and so beautiful. The gay bastard. He would never look at XiaoLan like that and he was still XiaoLan. Its bad enough he hated being a girl but when everyone already thought Prince was better... Guis gem like eyes opened slowly woken by some scream or another that always carried way too well in these stone walls. When he noticed prince his eyes shone with starlight but all Prince could see was the sadness from their irl date and the hurt and anger the burned her insides at the realization that no matter how he hated XiaoLan she would never be good enough for anyone. The anger took over at Guis cry of his name. He didnt hit the bard too hard He wasnt turned into a pillar of light so he was fine. He only hit Gui are hard as the gay fucker deserved Whats wrong He said immediately as if Prince didnt just try to melee him to the rebirth point. He tried to swallow his feelings like XiaoLan did but he wasnt XiaoLan. XiaoLan wasnt good enough. XiaoLan didnt exist in Second life. He wasnt her and he was too drunk too angry to care. He hit Gui again. Why did you have to be gay He meant to just think the question not scream it. As if screaming a summons instead Lolidragon ran in barely acknowledging Doll in shadows of the doorway with Feng Wu Qing and Nan Gong Zui following shortly behind. The first thing they saw was was Gui health significantly depleted and Princes fist raised feet unsteady ready to attack the bard again. Nan Gong Zui jerked forward to steady his stumbling. Prince punched him too. Stay out of this All I want to know is why this homo keeps pour all him energy into chasing me Ive told him no He rounded on Gui again. Ive told you no Nan Gong Zui looked to Lolidragon and Feng Wu Qing at a loss. They wore matching grim expressions but Feng Wu Qing had a tinge of pity in his eyes. He seemed to know something the rest of them didnt. He was ready to ask if something came to light through their infamous rivalry but Prince was yelling again progressing on Guis panic frozen form. Just admit it You know who I am dont you Nan Gong Zui considered stepping between them but Feng Wu Qing tapped his fan to his chest. He needs to let this out. He needs to see that its all in his head. You see me all damn day and you still just ignore me and know. You get off at the power difference dont you Hope Ill come crawling to you like some teachers pet or something Or are you such an asshole that you only give a shit when I have a dick Piece of shit I hate you Lolidragon took a sharp breath but was the only one to do so the only one to outwardly process the slip. Between the foul language and the reveal no one moved. Gui was too busy trying to tame his spinning mind. He promised he wouldnt wouldnt look into Prince or his identity. He said that no matter what he wouldnt care who Prince was in life. But knowing from Prince himself that he saw him everyday none the wiser brought questions. Would he really be okay with whoever Prince was Was he really able to go back in his word by sorting through each of his students speech patters and habits Was he really gay and why would that be such an issue Once upon a time a classmate after listen to him grieve about another suitor bothering him the friend ended the night with a suggestion. All he said was research Demisexual but he never did. Now looking at Princes angry tears he regrets his negligence. He had gathered a vague definition from his time in second life and the evidence fit. He only started bothering Prince to amuse himself but somehow fell in love. He dont know when or how but it just happened... Was that why he was upset Was Prince odd like him in some way He missed the incoming swing to his face. He only watched as his health chipped further away. Why the Fuck arent you saying anything Prince screamed as Nan Gong Zui captured his arms. Lolidragon snapped her patience and resolve crumbling as one. Get him out of here Ill deal with Gui They need to resolve this themselves Feng Wu Qing snapped back. Its Guis fault for not responding Princegege is cursed. Dolls soft voice from the shadows made them jump. Its probably from a ghoul type monster he fought but nothing will be resolved. He will just get angrier... thats why the more he yells they more his health drops. With little more than a glance and a curse Feng Wu Qing moved to save his stupid older brother. Hey Dage he took one of Princes hands and brushed a hand through his hair. It was a familiar motion to both of them from those few times their parents were around for sick days. Something warm and comforting just enough to get his feverish eyes to focus. See youre okay. You called me... I know he gave her a smile and nodded to Nan Gong Zui to set him down. He had to move quickly to grab him from his away to the floor but when he did Prince clung to him. Princes fist curled into his baby brothers robes. I hate him he whispered pathetically into his shoulder. Rubbing his big brothers shoulder Feng Wu Qing sighed I know. Of course he knew XiaoLan was carrying some kind of burden. He had heard her rage and curse Guiliastes before for his indirect insults and ignorance. He could remember the rare moments he walked in on moments she tried to hide. Her wrapping bandages around her chest a pair of scissors in hand as she held her ponytail the way she was slowly carving all femininity out of her closet. He didnt understand why but he knew she was in pain. It didnt matter that they didnt look like twins anymore. It didnt even matter that they tried to keep their distance despite living in the same house and going to the same school or that they found each other annoying and insufferable. She was his twin and weather she was his brother or sister they were his family and they needed help. If nothing else they always had each other. Lets go find Wolfgege he said softly. Wolf always knows how to make you feel better right Prince nodded slowly pulling away but still clung to his brothers arms. Yeah okay... but Im not lying about cramps this time. I know he said through a laugh. Every time he thought he was starting to think of his twin as a brother they would say shit like that He took his time guiding them both down the hall and pulling up the messenger. It would be weird if you did. Prince nodded along with his baby brother when suddenly another sob ripped through him. God I feel like I drank a bar Im sorry I dont think Ill be able to make you breakfast. Please dont hate me Feng Wu Qing frowned at the words realizing yet another topic they would have to address. Just as he was pondering a therapist he smiled when he heard Loli snap all the way from down the hall. What did you do Gui fumbled. I didnt I dont Prince just started yelling me Nan Gong Zui joined the accusation. You had to do something. Prince would not just turn on one of his teammates without reason I dont know He was singing then just started yelling at me I though he was going to kill me this time. Doll huffed shoving the large warriors it of her way as she placed herself between all of them. I told you he was cursed It was a Ghoul Type Soul Burn. He was forced to bare all the negativity in his soul until he burns his health away. Princegege is upset with Guigege and the spell just made him actually say it Remember that controversy about the gear affecting the users brain Lolidragon went quiet but Guis stricken look was enough. So he really hates me Doll shrugged. If he was what would you do about it. He said pretty clearly why even if youre too shocked to notice. Slowly he traced back over every insult and stab at his heart. Every word and connotation until finally it hit him. Only if I have a dick for you to suck implying that irl he didnt have one. He all but said Prince is a girl. He breathed. He froze at Lolidragons sharp breath. You knew He growled. Dont you think the members of this team would have deserved to know Girls are treated differently in games He didnt want anyone to know He wanted people to figure it out Nan Gong Zui rubbed his temple face pale from all the signs missed plots that Prince hatched or went along with. Who else knows Wicked Doll sang. They were childhood friends. Guis eyes widened Wicked Feng Wu Qing they both knew Prince irl. They were close. So where the two from the Eastern continent who where students in his class and swiftly joined Princes inner circle. They all interacted like family and their only common factor was... Gods FengLan.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/13823829,A Prince?,Game Start Harry browsed the game shelves loosely holding onto the one game hed come here specifically for. Hed never been a gamer not really having time the time what with the Dursleys and the Wizarding World basically controlling life but now he actually had a chance to try it out and if he could meet his little sister in the game all the better. Nothing else popped out at him though so he brought his prize to the smiling attendant at the counter. The girl was much too chipper in his opinion but he was able to check out with little fanfare.Cautiously the wizard made his way back to the new apartment in T City pulling up his hood to avoid being completely doused in the chilly rain. His purchase was safely tucked away inside his charmed jacket so that wasnt a worry. Instead he kept a careful eye out for any suspicious activity. He knew the war was over intellectually but his paranoia was a constant friend. Not that it wasnt needed what with the constant dodging of Death Eaters that just didnt know when to give up. They were the entire reason Harry had been literally all over the world the Asiatic countries just being the last on the list of places during his three year running stint.Oh Merlin. Hed had the shock of the lifetime as soon as he set foot in Tokyo Japan. Surrounded on all sides hed freaked out thinking of a Death Eater ambush and started powerhousing through the local authority. Not that hed know thats what they were at the time of course. Eventually he ended up fleeing all the way to Kyoto where he was taken down by the elite guard of the Emperor of the magical world. Yea he had so not learned how to deal with Yokai though hed impressed them with his tenacity and ingenuity in spell usage.Waking up pain free and in an overly opulent gold and red room decorated by moving statues of Japanese Kirins had shocked him enough not to attack the people surrounding him immediately. Lucky for him at the time. Thats when he learned hed basically been abducted by the Emperor himselfthrough his guards of course because they thought he was some long lost child of the Chinese Emperor. Yeah right.Well turns out they were right. Magical signature and DNA tests were conducted post haste turning out positive. That well it wasnt one of the most embarrassing meltdowns hed had but it definitely ranked high on the list. Being the overprotective Hero he also had to shoot down the idea that they reveal him to the public. Why Because he was Harry bloody Potter thats why. And heres the scar for proof.That hadnt gone over so well Japan almost ready to declare war on Britain if he hadnt dissuaded them from their honorable intentions. Merlin if he thought the Japanese were miffed well The Chinese had them beat by a landslide. That argument went down in the history books for longest correspondence with the fastest hawks ever. Harry won in the end if only due to the birds exhaustion and refusing to deliver messages.For the next few months Japan got to play host to the Heir to the Chinese throne and Harry or Wang Fei as he was named at birth got to learn a little a lot about his history. He learned his birthday was actually August 1st at 233 am he was stolen at barely 13 months and was declared officially dead in his home country after three years of searching. His younger sister was born 1 year and 4 months after him causing quite the celebration she preferred to go by Doll and his parents were actually quite nice when not worked up into a towering fury. He also was forced to learn of the past Emperors political crap and allied nations including Japan. His favorite thing to learn during his whole time there though was about the magical creatures and beings of each country especially Yokai and demons from other countries and the sparslessons he received from the Royal Guard.Overall it was the most intense but relaxing time hed had since before Hogwarts and it gave him much needed time to rest from being hunted.Eventually he agreed to move to China but absolutely refused to go near the palace just yet. He loved his time in Japan but being an honored guest was much better than being the Honored Heir and Harry particularly liked his freedom. There was also the fact that he couldnt quite kick his paranoia and saving people thing so he couldnt allow the Death Eaters to get near his family even if they were warded to the nines with guards everywhere. He wanted to meet his family but didnt want to be trapped or cause any trouble just yet so T City it was. It was fairly close to the palace and also had convenient marketplaces all around.His apartment was in a larger building not tall being only three stories compared to a lot of the skyscrapers around but fairly spread out over some acres. Not too expensive but also not the hovels he was used to staying in. The stipend his parents sent him helped with that but only after they won the argument over money. It was his money too they had said. Well now his money had also bought the newest game on the market called Second Life and if he was lucky hed be able to meet his little sister who also had an account. It was actually sort of cute how she raved about it in her letters.Right now how in the world does this thing even work he muttered turning the helmet over in his hands. Technology was not his forte at all. He despaired at see the wires and the helmet but if he wanted to do this and not look like a complete idiot to his friendly neighbors he had to do this himself. Sucking in a breath he glanced over the manual again noting the little ports on the bottom of the helmet. Hed have to get it hooked up to the internet for the downloads.Cmon Harry Its an instruction manual with step by step instruction It cant be that hardWith having said that encouraging little tidbit to himself he grabbed the first wire a light grey with a weird shaped doofer on the end and glanced at the manual. According to this the weird bit went into a wall for hardline internet or he could use a computer for wifi and forgo the wire entirely. Well seeing as he didnt own a laptop just yet and he knew wifi was wireless internet thanks Poland hed have to use the wall. The wizard vaguely remembered the landlady saying something about free internet in these buildings being included and there was a funny shaped outlet behind his bed. Couldnt hurt to try rightWith a little maneuvering the bed was pushed up against the wall of his bedroom the dresser that had been there previously now blocking the door but that could be dealt with later exposing the funny outlet where Harry then proceeded to shove the funky end of the wire into. It was a perfect fit Right he could so do this. The other end was flat with a more trapezoid shaped head. That easily slotted into the helmet and he waited for the light at the top to start flashing green signifying that it was downloading. He sat on the floor and stared at it for a few good minutes just waiting before he finally gave up and looked to the manual for help.The helmet didnt come charged. Of course it didnt. Now Harry just felt like an utter fool as he snatched the black wire from the bed. Once again he slotted the wire into the helmet port and dragged the pronged end over to the outlet a few feet away from the funky one. A red light flashed near the visor as soon as it was plugged in. Well at least he wasnt a complete numpty then. The manual said it would take a few hours to charge so he left the helmet on the floor and walked into his small living room after shoving the dresser to the opposite side of the room. It contained a beautiful brown suede couch a matching recliner chair and a coffee table. Where a telly might be in a normal house sat his inconspicuous trunk that contained mostly all he ever needed while on the run. Plus a few extra rooms for brewing and libraries and such. He could have gotten a bigger place but this one bedroom apartment was perfect for him.Passing through the living room he made a beeline to the fridge pulling out some fresh greens and veggies to make a salad. Now that he had a nicer place to settle and lower risk of Death Eaters tracking him at least for a while he could make himself something healthy. Harry stared at the computer screen in front of him as the little boy chattered on about the different classes and how assigning your ability points was crucial to character development. The little instruction booklet in the games case didnt have near as much information. It only told him how to work things and explained a few of the classes. This was an overload of information.Bao didnt seem to notice his new friends glazed eyes but his mother sure did. She called for dinner making the small boy pout and Harry sent her a thankful look. A few days ago he hadnt been expecting a knock on his door and an invite to dinner seeing as hed only been here around a week and he didnt know any of these people. He politely declined but An Di could be a bloody dragon with her stubbornness. She was a force to be reckoned when she found out that he was alone in his apartment and usually just ate salad for dinner. He still had no idea how shed figured that out as he rarely left but he appreciated the effort she put in for him and his therapist said he needed to to socialise more. Hed also done a thorough check or as thorough as he could with limited resources as he so wasnt going to involve his new family to make sure she wasnt an imperial guard or some form of threat to him. She passed with flying colors. The single mother was just a strong independant woman raising her son in a society that frowned upon such actions. He gave her props for that alone.The only reason hed finally given into her daily invitation today was that her son Bao Di was chattering behind her into a small phone about the awesome quest he had finished just that morning in Second Life. Wanting to learn more about the game he agreed and once the boy was off the phone asked for tips. An 8 year old boy grinning manically was a slightly terrifying sight. He was dragged to a very worn laptop under protest and trying to get the boy to release his wrist without hurting him. Then the info dump of massive proportions was dropped on his head and he forgot all about someone touching him. Harry swore he was going to be dreaming of stats in nightmare format tonight.So what prompted you to buy the game Wang Fei You dont seem the type An Di commented laying the serving bowls on the table. Grilled whole fish rice and an assortment of grilled veggies was an absolutely heavenly smell.I have a little sister that I cant see right now. I wanted to meet up with her in the game Harry replied.Oh how sweet of you she giggled as Bao dug into the rice and snapped up some fish really quickly.After dinner I want to show him all the bosses Mom can I pleaseBy the time he got back to his apartment Harry was absolutely exhausted and had just enough energy to make sure everything was locked up. He barely missed tripping over his helmet as he dropped in his bed the springs bouncing underneath him and he was out like a light.When he woke up the next day it took him a minute to understand why he was still fully dressed and on top of his covers. With a grunt he pushed himself up onto his forearms shaking off the last vestiges of the strange dream hed had. He could honestly admit that was one of the best rests hed had since coming to China even if it was filled with floating numbers and different character routes. Speaking ofHe turned his green eyes onto the helmet on the floor noting the steady green light that signaled downloading was complete. He glanced down at his sleep wrinkled clothing. Perhaps he could afford to be lazy for today. Its not like he had anywhere to be until the next semester of school started anyways. With a little bit of excited glee he flipped over and kicked off his shoes and pants onto the floor before working on freeing himself of his button up shirt. If he was gonna be laying down for this he was going to be comfortable one of the upsides of living alone. Once he had stripped to his boxers he gently lifted the helmet from the floor and wondered if it was supposed to stay connected.With a huff he set it down on his bed and picked up the discarded instruction manual and game booklet and flipped through them. Okay so the charge would last for almost 24 hrs if it was unplugged but it could be left in during gameplay. Charging and playing at the same time too often would start to damage the battery which could lead to small amounts of radioactivity Wait. They seriously sold these things to kidsOkay Calm down Harry Just dont play and charge it at the same time. Its not like youll be playing for more than 24 hours a day anyway.With a decisive nod he searched for the internet wire instructions. Apparently he was supposed to leave it in if he didnt have wifi because the game needed to be connected as it was a MMORPG Whatever that was. But internet was needed so hed leave that cable alone it was long enough to reach the bed with extra to spare. So hed tossed the books onto the dresser stepped over his clothes and picked up the helmet again. With a pop the charger cable came out and was dropped carelessly on the floor. He sat gingerly on the edge of the bed staring at the game helmet.This was it. The first video game he would ever play and the machinery was a knowledge that was mostly lost on him. And then there was his magic which he had no idea how it would react. Technology was not the antithesis to magic as hed thought during Hogwarts. Running through the very technologically advanced America Poland and Italy had proven that and then Japan had proven his mistaken belief wrong on many occasions as well. Unfortunately magic could still fry machines and anything running on electricity if given in high enough doses that it wasnt ready for. The Emperor found that out the day of Harrys meltdown when practically everything technological short circuited within a mile radius.The wizard really needed to stop thinking of all the negatives. This was his chance to see DollBut first he laid the helmet on the bed and did a quick check of the apartment. Everything was locked and secured nothing out of place. It was finally time Harry almost skipped back to the room but forced himself to only slightly speedwalk.He took a breath grabbed the helmet and stuffed it on his head wincing a bit at the tight fit the padding still needed to be broken in before carefully laying down. Slowly he drifted into unconsciousness as the game activated completely missing the three shimmering orbs that sank into the headset.Black. Everything was pitch black and for a moment the war veteran felt a peace hed not had since his first introduction to the wizarding world. That peace was shattered with a blinding flash of dizzying blue as his surroundings melted into a white chamber that seemed to stretch for eternity on all sides.Harry blinked dazedly body tense and ready to fight glancing at the floating chair that held a small girl wearing a helmet with wires coming out of it from nearly the entire thing. The different colored wires all went back into the chair behind her making her look like some macabre parody of some cheesy old scifi science experiment. The front had a giant three emblazoned upon it which meant absolutely nothing to Harry. She shifted her curtain of long chestnut brown hair waving slightly and smiled down at him. Hello and welcome to Second Life Here you will be creating your avatar and once it is made there can be no changes afterwards. Because it is supposed to be 99.9 realism guaranteed there will be no changing of genders or anything of that sort she chirped cheerfully with a small twinkle in her brown eyes.She opened her mouth to talk again but paused cocking her head to the side as if listening to someone speak. After a moment her attitude became even more cheery if that was even possible. Wow You are our one millionth player to create an account. How extremely lucky The creators will give you wish in celebration so choose wiselyUm. Harry muttered in shock Ill choose my wish later.The girl nodded energetically.Can I Harry paused thinking over the race options Bai had explained to him last night. While choosing the angelic race would give him the freedom of flight it was also the class that had the least amount of physical and magical defense. So that was out. He didnt really want to be human even if overall they had the most wellrounded stats. He wasnt into becoming a beast either. Really the only choice he even remotely liked was the elves and that was mostly because of his fascination with High Elves during his schooling. It was a wonderful day when hed stumbled across an ancient tome in the Black library that spoke of the Elvhen people leaving for another dimension. Actually that was pretty much the start of his fascination with all types of beings and creatures. That day he had been in such a fantastic mood that not even the cruciatus he had suffered in his dreams via Tom had brought him down.The game elves had extremely high agility but just like the angel race had pretty terrible physical defense. The magical defense was decent at least. ... see myself as an elfSlowly a form fizzled into existence in front of him and Harry had to admit that he liked it. His tan skin had lightened to a fairer tone and his hair fell slightly flatter but not enough to make a difference in the birds nest of flyaway hair it normally was. His ears were long enough to poke out of the black hair. Other than that he looked just as tired and thin as Harry himself. It was pretty realistic.Would you like to either beautify or uglify by 30There was actually an option to uglify Okay Ill do the beautify I guess the wizard said softly.The girl nodded her head even though Harry couldnt see it and added the beautification to the bishie that was already in front of her. The end result had the small girl trying in vain to stem a nosebleed. Harry stared critically at the healthier looking avatar. For once he actually looked like a normal person. A normal person that had a normal life with no nightmares or paranoia haunting his every step. It was oddly satisfying.When the avatar opened his eyes there were twin gasps and a resounding thump behind Harry startling him into turning around. The girl had fallen off the chair the helmet rolling a small distance away. He turned his attention back to the form in front of him keeping an ear open for the person behind him. The sclera were completely pitch black where there should have only been white. It made the elfs already glowing eyes seem ominous and his face took a more feral expression. It was disconcerting but slightly awesome.Oh my Im so sorry There must be a glitch in the system that I can have fixed right awNo Harry interrupted. Id like to leave it like this. If you would pleaseHe glanced up at the still blushing female slipping the fallen helmet back on clumsily. A thoughtful look stole over her face and hesitantly she nodded. In a firm tone she said But if it gives you any problems Pm me. My name is Lolicat and Im a GM okayHarry nodded and turned his attention back to the elf version of himself. There was just something saying that he should keep those eyes and there was nothing saying there werent muggleborns that played this game. He could not allow himself to be recognized in that case. He was being extremely risky in only barely glamoring himself while in China and that didnt even seem to apply here in the game world. So he needed to make him look different and while the eyes were definitely a distraction he needed something more.Ah Could you turn the scar into a tattoo and elongate it through my eye and and to the bottom of my chin Is lengthening hair possibleOf course And how long would you like itHm calf length please. It would be easy to braid out of his way and long hair was quite different than his normal rats nest. The tattoo was perfect looking nothing like how his original scar did. The hair was also nice with the length weighing it down there was only a slight wave to it instead of the mess he was used to. Can I change the colorWell its possible butHarry turned to her with a raised brow ButMay I make a suggestionPlease do. If I dont like it I reserve the right to reject it though.But of course With your current skin tone and the way youre opting for a more intimidating look Is that what hed been going for Hed just wanted to make himself unrecognizable Id say to darken your hair. Right now its very dark brown but making it black or blue black no just regular black as the blue would contrast your eyes too much. Anyway the dark would make your skin pop in a very pleasant wayHarry mulled it over. He was trying to change his appearance entirely but.. This was the first time hed seen himself so pleasing to the eye. It was the first time ever that Harry actually enjoyed looking at himself. He supposed the previous two changes would sufficiently hide him from most common sense lacking wizards. Well it wasnt like he wasnt already risking his hide with the glamors already. His paranoia could kiss his ass for once he wanted to enjoy this game and search for his little sister.Alright he agreed watching the very long hair darken. It was definitely very pretty to look at.Is there anything else now Lolicat had to try very hard to hold in her squealing. Lolidragon was going to be so jealous that shed met a bishie on par with Prince or even better considering his more masculine lean compared to Princes distinctly feminine look. And shed even gotten to help him if only slightly with his character designNo.Of course Have you thought about what youd like your wish to beHe hadnt. Not really. Harry had been too busy admiring himself embarrassingly enough. Hed never had the chance to be vain like this after all. It definitely had to be something nonrestrictive and his mind flashed briefly to the angel class. It was like an epiphany and with a smile the soontobeplayer turned to Lolicat and asked for wings.It was such a strange request that she hesitated but the full force of those pleading green eyes and that hopeful little smile did her in. She contacted the creators and was silent for a few minutes while Harry fidgeted impatiently forcing himself to still. Fidgeting was movement that could give away your position.Her eyes opened and she jerked her chin at the avatar. There just barely poking over the shoulders were the tips of what looked to be tiny bird wings. The wizard walked behind his avatar to study them. They were a beautiful brown that turned white at the tips but...they werent quite what he was expectingYoull need to level them up just like any skill. The more you use them the larger theyll get. This makes it fair to all the players okayThat made a lot of sense.Alright. Im done with my character then.Oh no youre not You still havent decided on a name Lolicat exclaimed.Harry looked startled at her exuberance but nodded and started thinking. There wasnt anything he could think of that would fit. Obviously he was not going to use his titles from the wizarding world that would be a dead giveaway. Hermiones voice popped up exclaiming his people saving thing. Harry shook his head. That would be a dead give away and Saviour of the Wizarding World was one of his titles.But her voice nagged at him in the back of his mind. Hed always been the Saviour even of the bullied and downtrodden. The wizard groaned and rubbed his eyes. Why was this so hardWould you like some suggestionNo no I would like to be named Savior. Hermione always did win those arguments in the end. And just because it was his screen name didnt mean anything There was going to be no funny business in this game. Id like to start on the Central Continent please.Happily flouncing back to her chair Lolicat sat and activated the players life. Oh yeah All players stats are randomly assigned so you dont have to worry about that she beamed cheerily as the man and his avatar merged and disappeared.,Teen And Up Audiences,YaoiPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder - PTSDWarAnxietyAnxiety AttacksRomanceI suck at writingHow Do I TagRewriteDeal with your emotions dammitHarry whyswitch - FreeformI suck at describing thingsSurvival PersonalityCaelus loves his elfJust Add Kittensthey make everything better

Somehow against all odds theyd saved Second Life from being completely shut down. We did it We actually did itAnd yet......And yet...Even as she grinned up at the empty ceiling hot tears coursed down the sides of her face. Hes gone.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/14785772,Prince or Princess,Feng Lan Have you heard The new rumor about Second Life a strangers voice filled the cafe where Feng Lan sat sipping at her coffee with a book in front of her. She really did need to keep up with her homework a little better especially with how much of her time Second Life took these days. Since she was no longer just a casual player and instead the most recognizable face in the entire game certain things felt expected of her. She definitely didnt have enough timeor indeed enough interestto keep up with the various gossip about the game outside of playing it. Thats what Lolidragon was for after all. Anything important that Feng Lan or Prince needed to know Lolidragon would be sure to tell her right away. So even though she couldnt avoid overhearing what the girl was saying Feng Lan didnt think there was any reason to be concerned.You mean about the tranny player Or at least she hadnt until the other girl spoke and Feng Lans blood ran a little cold. Some people knew about her by now sure but it wasnt spread to anyone besides her best friends immediate family and Lolidragon. How did anyone else know about thatYes I couldnt believe it either the pair continued gossiping unaware that the subject of the conversation was slowly trying to sink more and more into her chair as she could feel panic building within her. I didnt think Second Life allowed that kind of thing.They dont.How could they make that kind of mistake That poor person.I dont know about that. Do you want to know what I heard The other girl leaned forward with interest and very clearly did. I watched this video on it and they said they think its actually not a fluke. They think it was intentional.What ReallyYeah there was an interview with the developers where they admitted to giving a special prize to the very first player to log in.Is that fairThats what the interviewers asked but they were very clear in saying that it wasnt any kind of prize that would give the person an unfair advantage.Whoa.I know rightBut then why would it be listed like it wasI dont know maybe it was new staff working on itSo this tranny player if they were the first to log in theyre probably pretty high level. Theyve got to be one of the strongest players in the game. It could even be Prince There was a pause after the one girl declared that before the two of them quickly dissolved into laughter shaking their heads and dismissing that idea as impossible. Of course there was no way that Prince could be anyone but a cool guy of that they were sure. They were still laughing when Feng Lan approached the table awkwardly shuffling on her feet.Sorry I didnt mean to overhear but where did you guys hear about that she found herself asking the pair trying to seem much more confident than she was.Everyones talking about it the first of the girls said once shed recovered from her surprise at being approached and seeming all too willing to talk about the juicy gossip even with a stranger. Well not everyone yet but a lot of people are figuring it out.Apparently it was written in the changelog as a bug that was going to be fixed added the other and the two continued their debate on the subject but Feng Lan was only half listening. She didnt even remember to take her book with her as she exited the cafe making a beeline for home despite not having planned to log in for quite a while longer. All she knew was that she had to find out just what was going on. Prince The very first thing Prince did when he logged in was to try and sort out the menus but it became very clear that he almost never used any other than the basic ones which left him helplessly looking for a while before giving up and sending out a team message asking for Lolidragon. Of course that meant that when he showed up where she wanted to meet the entire Odd Squad was there looking curious about what the team meeting had been called for. Mentally kicking himself Prince grabbed Lolidragon by the arm to pull her away and whisper conspiratorially to her.How do you find the changelog he asked desperation clear in his voice despite not wanting to give her information about just why he was so concerned about that. Lolidragon looked at him confused but even if it wasnt like Prince to be concerned with these kind of game aspects it was definitely like Prince to do things out of the ordinary. It took her just few seconds to explain.Why did you want to know she asked him but Prince was already focused in on the menu and scanning through the log that had popped up in front of him. Identified a bug in character gender recognition to be fixed in the next patch And there it was. The thing that terrified Prince so much was now staring back at him in simple back letters. Maybe it was a small thing and ultimately there was no way of knowing if it would ever mean anything but even if it wasnt about him specificallyand there was no way it wasntdidnt it still expose himLolidragon Prince began having ignored all her questions and the concern from his other teammates as well as hed lost himself in his own panic. Whens the next patch supposed to happen Once again she looked surprised that Prince would take any kind of interest in such a thing. Prince couldnt help it the words to be fixed continued to stick out in his mind and he felt a flood of panic. Fixing a bug wasnt that just the same as trying to remove it altogether This wasnt just about being exposed as Prince looked at the words he truly panicked.No not Prince. Feng Lan was panicked. Prince would always be Prince but what would she do if Prince was removed All the time effort and emotions that had gone into this game for them all to just be gone And what about her friendsPrince looked over at the Odd Squad members feeling almost like he wanted to cry. He couldnt lose them. It really wasnt fair was it Just because hed wanted to play the game and not be coddled for his gender Prince now stood to lose everything. It just wasnt fair.Uh It should be any time now Lolidragon was replying to his question but Prince was only barely listening to her now. Too much was going on in his head that there wasnt any answer that she could have given him to snap him out of it all. Prince. Prince are you okay Had it not been for the expression on his face in that moment Lolidragon would have likely been much more forceful in her questions and even giving him a smack on the head to try and wake him back up but Princes expression looked so hopeless that she was almost afraid to do anything and fear was not an emotion Lolidragon felt lightly.Any moment. Prince repeated the cold feeling of dread still running through his veins. There was no guarantee of anything he feared but somehow he still knew that something terrible would happen. He could just feel it. Suddenly Prince gasped and his eyes unfocused. The others turned to him worriedly Gui rushing to his side.Prince he asked worriedly his hands cupping the elfs face. Prince was unresponsive. Guis eyes continually widened with terror. Then just as suddenly Prince collapsed to the floor. Gui made to catch him but he had been taken by surprise like the rest and he only just managed to keep Princes head from smacking the stone floor. The room was silent for an entire ten minutes as Gui cradled Princes head and then all at once Prince suddenly recovered. He stood pushing Gui lightly away with one hand pressed to his own forehead and began to turn around in a slow circle as though not really sure what he was seeing. His eyes were still unfocused.Where am I he whispered. His companions all traded worried glances before turning their near terrified eyes on Prince once again.Prince Ugly Wolf asked carefully. He was the only one brave enough to approach their disoriented friend. At his voice Princes eyes snapped back into focus and he furrowed his brow at Ugly Wolf. He opened his mouth to say something but closed it again with a shake of his head. He shook his head again and then another time each shake more violent than the last. It was as though he was trying to shake some image out of his head. Finally he turned to Lolidragon.Something very weird is happening he said. Princess When she opened her eyes Princess found herself staring up at an emerald green canopy. Of course she didnt know that she was called Princess or that she was even a she at all. She thought she was a male elven warrior named Prince and she had been up until a moment ago or so it seemed anyway. Lolidragon was always better with the computer stuff and it was generally best to leave it to her. Slowly Princess stood and turned in a slow circle to examine her surroundings. Where had the castle gone And her friends Why were there so many trees Was this all part of the patch that Lolidragon claimed was incoming It didnt seem like it was considering Princess doubted that even a major patch wound leave her stranded out in some unfamiliar forest. At least not without leaving her feeling other odd effects as well. So many important questions flooded her mind but there was only one that felt immediately important.Where am I she asked the forest. The forest didnt answer and maybe that was for the best. It brought her no closer to an answer but talking trees might have presented an even bigger problem. Still she could hear someone call her nameher other namebut the voice sounded far away and muted like a shout trying to fight its way through the depths of some great ocean. Putting it all together she came up with the definitive analysis of the situation.Something very weird is happening she told the forest. Once again the forest didnt seem to care.,General Audiences,ComedyRomance
https://archiveofourown.org/works/670002,Prince For a Day,It just isnt fair Prince royally declared. He had whined er declared this during one of the meetings held by the department leaders of Infinite City. The meeting had almost reached its completion when he had declared this.You dont listen to my suggestions you dont seek my advice. Prince counted off two fingers here as he stood impressively not slouching a liege lord didnt slouch.Im supposed to be the lord Infinite City but Im always the last to know about the plans. A third finger counted.I cant go out and just slaughter mobs. Four fingers now.I always need to keep up the blood elf fa√ßade. He stuck out his thumb to emphasize this point but realized he had run out of fingers as Meatbun was happily snoozing in his other hand. Not wanting to break the flow of his moaning or rather of his proclamations he put his used up hand away and continued on.None of my friends treat me the same calling me lord all the time. The famous blood elf was not pouting like a petulant child.You dress me up like a decoration and parade me around. This remark was especially directed at a certain thief but she feigned ignorance of that and continued to clean her nails with a knife.I am the liege lord yet what do I even do Finally Prince finished his royal proclamationor tantrum if you will.Do White Bird parroted back after several minutes of silence. You are the face of Infinite City.But what do I do Repeated Prince insistently.You take care of the ceremonies and you uphold the reputation of Infinite City said White BirdThats it Thats got to be the simplest job in the entire city Why cant I help with something else for a change Prince was still insistent.Because that is all you are capable of Lolidragon replied simply insensitive as ever.The Odd Squad felt quite sure that they knew Prince better than anyone there and they felt that they could predict with near certainty all his actions. Yet none of them had ever seen Prince truly angry. They had seen him depressed and guilty. Happiness seemed more or less a usual state of affairs for him but anger they hadnt seen. Prince had been annoyed before usually directly preceding Wolfd√°gƒì having to heal Gui but the Odd Squad had all just assumed that by now he had resigned himself to his fate and would go along with whatever came. This being said they were all noticeably surprised when Prince neither stormed off in a huff beat up Gui or commented back. He just logged off.,General Audiences,HumorMistaken IdentityMisunderstandingsepisodicBody Swap
https://archiveofourown.org/works/3414113,Magic,I woke up to ringing in my ears. I do not know were it came from or why I had heard it but I did. And now I fear that it ment something like a warning of some kind. A warning that I can not begin to understand. It started when I was 13. I was walking to class when these boys ripped my binder out of my hands and started tearing all the pages inside. All my school work and essays gone. I bent down on my knees trying not to cry while picking up the papers when the leader of the boys kicked me down and exclaimed You are such a FREAK Have you ever been called a freak Because if you havent let me tell you this It is the worst thing you could EVER imagine. Its worse than any beating and it can tear a person apart I stopped picking up the papers and looked this boy straight in the eye and opened my mouth to speak but the words that came out wernt my own. They were words that i had never heard of words that sounded like an entirely different language but i knew what every word meant as if someone had told me. Rolem alem ersa verda nerage. was what came out of my mouth but Raise the boys to the ceiling is what it meant. And as if the boys were magnets and the ceiling metal the boys very rapidly flew to the ceiling. I had no idea what to do or what just happened but i knew i had to get out of there. I ran as fast as I could the tears burning my face as I ran. But I HAD to leave i just had to. I felt like a monster that I would be understood by no one. No one knows what its like. I had started talking to myself when this feeling came over this burning needing feeling raced through my body. Starting in my fingers it quickly went to my arm then my chest through my legs and then back up Surging to my head. My head began to throb. I quickly lifted my hands to my head as a ringing filled to air. I collapsed laying on the ground squirming and unable to breath suddenly everything went black.,General Audiences,Not Found
https://archiveofourown.org/works/49524868,The price of salvation,What was the price of salvation If you asked different people in this world youd get varying answers.For some it was a chest full of gold. For some it was caught and killed deer for dinner. For some it was safety. For others It was much more than that.This was something that one Abby Griffin learned soon after she and the rest of the Ark people had landed on the ground.Abby had sold out her own husband Jake Griffin to Thelonius Jaha the chancellor of the Ark. And because of this Jake Griffin was executed. Jake had found a flaw in the Arks system and had been about to report it but he was sold out to Thelonius Jaha by his own wife.This was before the Ark arrived down on the ground.Now that the Ark people were on the ground A step had to be made to make sure that they could survive here when apparently there were other people on the ground.Tribes. Tribes that didnt use weapons like the Ark did.But dangerous people nonetheless.From what Abby and the Ark people had learned There were twelve tribes on the ground plus one group in a mountain referred to as The Mountain Men and several other civilizations that were closer to the Ark people in culture than to the twelve tribes that didnt use firearms.These other civilizations were represented by a group that decided to speak for those civilizations.And they made a deal with Abby Griffin and the rest of the Ark people. They would give Abby and the rest of the Ark people safety from the Mountain Men and from the rest of the tribes if Abby and the Ark people gave them something in return.Or rather someone.At first Abby hadnt understood but all one of these figures had to do one of the women was raise her right hand and show Abby her palm. As soon as the woman had Abby understood with a shock.She had seen that soulmate mark on the other womans hand. She had seen it on her and her husbands daughters chest.Jake and Abbys daughter Clarke Griffin had only been seven when Jake had been executed.Now Clarke was behind Abby far back waiting at one of the shacks that the rest of the Ark people had built the small blonde girl waiting with her best friend Wells and with another adult Callie unaware of the transaction that was being made.Abby stared at the mark on the womans palm. The mark was of a red hourglass.Several of the other messengers raised their own hands and Abby gasped seeing these marks.Do you understand The first woman who had raised her hand Natasha asked We felt her presence as soon as your Ark landed. I know that she feels us. She just doesnt understand what she feels right now. Our price is that when the time comes You will let us take her and let us marry her.Wwhen the time comes Abby asked feeling numb looking at the messengers in confusion.Yes one of the men answered stepping forward When Clarke is twentytwo years old well come back for her alright Shes a child. Were not going anywhere near her. When she is twentytwo fifteen years from now Were going to come back for her and make her ours.You wont have to worry another woman added her voice possessing a Russian accent Well give her everything. Shell be very well taken care of. And in return your people will be protected by our people. Youll have protection both from the twelve tribes and from the Mountain Men. From now on you will have that protection. In return in fifteen years you wont interfere when we come here to take Clarke with us.Abbys eyes widened and her jaw dropped.Now she understood why these people had demanded to speak specifically to her only and not to Thelonius Jaha or to Kane or to Callie.It wasnt that Thelonius Jaha or Kane would have refusedthey wouldnt have. If it meant the safety of their people They would have sacrificed ten children if that was what was needed.Callie probably wouldnt have agreed to it.But Abby was Clarkes mother. This concerned her a great deal. That was why these people had asked to speak with her specifically.Abby looked over these people noticing that at least three of Clarkes soulmates appeared to be young teenagers barely more than fourteen or so.Abby half thought of protecting Clarke from these people because she knew that that was what Jake would have wanted.But she instantly decided against that.Jake was dead. And the best way to protect their people from threats now Was to get protection.And if these people offered salvation then if she had to The only right thing would be to pay any price that they demanded of her. And of her daughter.Besides Abby had never cared all that much about Clarke anyway.She couldnt help it but she often hadnt been able to see Clarke as anything else except for a burden.Well all Abby would have to do was wait fifteen more years.She almost thought of asking of the group wanted to take Clarke with them now but stopped herself.If these people were really Clarkes soulmates Then she should at least give off the impression that she was a somewhat decent mother to Clarke.Clarke nodded to the men and women in this group. Alright she said As long as you provide Clarke with everything she needs for the rest of her life and that shes comfortable and happy and loved then thats all I care about.Of course Mrs. Griffin one of the men said smiling respectfully but Abby detected deception behind that smile We will give Clarke everything she could ever want and more. Thank you for understanding. I know this is a lot to ask of a mother.Abby nodded pretending that she cared about Clarke.She suspected the deceptive smile of the man meant that Clarke wouldnt actually be treated well. But Abby didnt care.Clarke and Jake had always felt like a unit like Clarke adored her father and Abby was in second place.That would teach Clarke not to favor someone over the woman that gave birth to her.After the agreement was made and the Ark peoples salvation had been found for the price of Clarke Griffin being married off to these people the group of messengers and Clarkes soulmates left.Little did Abby know that the deceit that the group were keeping from Abby was all about their disrespect for her.They had meant what they said that they would give Clarke literally everything the girl wanted and more.Their deceit was meant for Abby.They didnt respect Abby. Not in the least.Any good loving parent Would never sell their child into marriage.It was why after the group had left absolutely meaning to protect the Ark people from the Mountain Men and the twelve tribes and from any rebellion within the Ark people themselvesthis last part had been particularly requested on Abbys part they agreed amongst themselves that when the time came to take Clarke with them to their homes They would kill Abby themselves.Kill the odious woman who had sold out her own daughter.Over the years the messengers who Abby had learned the names of to be Natasha Romanoff Tony Stark Bruce Banner Steve Rogers Sam Wilson Thor Odinson Hela Odinsdotter Loki Laufeyson Sylvie Laufeysdotter Pepper Potts Luke Cage Jessica Jones Danny Rand Frank Castle Carol Danvers Wanda Maximoff Pietro Maximofftwins who were the barely fourteenyearold individuals that had been in the group Clint Barton Laura Barton James Rhodes who the others called Rhodey Charles Barton who everyone called Barney Simone Barton Yelena Belovawho had only been fifteen at the time when the deal had been made Melina Vostokoff Elektra Natchios Brunnhilde Maria Hill Stephen Strange Christine Palmer and Peggy Carter would inquire about Clarke.And she learned that they were deeply curious about Clarke no matter what age the girl was.That was why there continued to be letters from Clarkes soulmates would ask about Clarkes interests and what Clarke did as throughout the years and how she was holding up after her fathers death.These people in the letters wanted to know literally everything. What foods Clarke liked what her interests were everything.A few years went by and Abby got used to the letters asking things like Does Clarke still love dinosaurs or Does Clarke still like to draw and paint or Did Clarke get that teddy bear we sent herAll the while Clarke grew up unaware of the deal which had been made which involved her so intimately.four years after the deal had first been made bombs hit Mount Weather. Bombs obviously coming from the more civilized societies.Those that Abby had made the deal with apparently took their arrangement very seriously.So they got rid of all of the Mountain Men before the Mountain Men could become a large threat to the Ark people.They bombed Mount Weather and killed all of the Mountain Men inside including all of the children.It had been a shock for everyone who wasnt the Mountain Men. When the mountain was dust and everyone inside dead The tribes no longer lived in fear but knew to stay away from the Ark people realizing that these ground societies were providing protection for the Ark people.It had made Abby relieved but also aware of what might happen should she cheat those who she had made the deal with of their prize.But at least the Mountain Men were no longer a threat.And technically speaking the savage tribes were no longer a threat either because they feared the other ground societies and their weapons too much to move in on the Ark people.When at last fifteen years had gone by and Clarke was twentytwo Abby knew it was time.And knew that the least she could do was tell Clarke what was going to happen.So she seated the young woman down in front of her and explained as best as she could the deal she had made.When Clarke learned of what her mother had done she stared at her mother as if the woman were a stranger.You.you made that deal about me without my consent Clarke demanded disbelief in her voice You traded me off like I was cattleAbby sighed Dont be so dramatic. Youll be treated very well. Theyre your soulmates. Its not like I had the chance to marry my soulmate.This earned a blueeyed glare from Clarke to Abby. Is that why you had dad executed Because he wasnt your soulmateAbby gasped staring at Clarke in shock at this accusation.Clarke had found out Abby had thought that everyone else had kept it quiet. But had Kane or Thelonius told Clarke Or CallieOr someone elseClarke Abby stared trying to keep her voice reasonable I didnt know that was going to happen. I thought Jake would be imprisoned. I didnt know hed be executed. That was Thelonius Jahas decision.She wasnt lying when she said that. But she wasnt all that choked up that Jake was dead.Yeah Clarke nodded her blue eyes hard And you were the one that gave him to Jaha. You chose to sell him out. Just like you chose to sell me out. Fucking piece of shit.Abby stared at Clarke like she had been hit.She had never heard this language from her daughter before.Clarke snorted something close to hate in her voice when she spoke Fine if this keeps the rest of our people safe Ill go along with it. But lets be honest about whose fault this is. Its not mine. And you know Im not even sure I can say its the faults of my mates. It was your responsibility to keep me safe. And you fucked that up. Ill marry them to keep my people safe. But do you think if I told my mates that I wanted you dead that youll have long to liveA chill went down Abbys spine.Clarke wanted her deadClarke got up from her chair and stormed out of the room.Clarke fought the tears that she could feel coming on their own accord.Her mother had given her away. Like she was nothing. Her mother had traded her off like she was a piece of meat.Clarke ran out of the room fighting tears and wanting to scream wanting to throw something.How could she her mother Do this to her own childA thought hit Clarke then. Abby had sold out her husband to Thelonius Jaha. And now she was giving Clarke to a group of people that intended for Clarke to live with them.Had this been Abbys plan all along To get rid of her family But why If Abby had never wanted Jake or Clarke in the first place then why marry Jake and have a child with himClarke shook her head. Even if she was an adult herself She suspected she would never ever truly understand adults.Why did they do what they did Hurt the people that they hurtShe didnt understand them.Of course now she was going to be living against her will with up to thirty of them whether she liked it or not.Clarke shuddered as she thought about what that meant pushing back the strands of pale blonde hair from her face.Did that mean that she was going to be forced to have sex with her mates Clarke hated to say it but she was positive that that was what it meant.She was going to be forced to marry her mates and afterwards she would be forced to have sex with all of them. All thirty of them.Clarke swallowed hard.She didnt want this.She might be grateful to her mates for getting rid of the Mountain Men and for keeping her people safe from the twelve tribes in the coalition but she didnt want this.She wanted to live here with her friends with Wells and Callie and the others. Even knowing what Abby did she still wanted to live here.But it looked like she wouldnt have that choice available to her.She clenched her teeth feeling herself getting angry at her mother again.How dare sheHow dare that woman get Clarkes father killed then sell Clarke out to the highest bidder that came forward And how dare she pretend that she was doing it for the right reasonsAbby did everything for one reason. For herself.When Clarke had said that she thought about getting her mother killed by requesting that of her mates She hadnt meant it. It had entirely been a bluff. She had been angry at her mother and had wanted to hurt her mothers feelings. But that wasnt the same thing as wanting her mothers death.But the things that Abby had done It might just get Clarke to want to kill Abby at some point.Still Clarke was left to suffer knowing what her mother had done.Until Clarkes mates arrived at their camp two weeks later.There were thirty of them just like Abby had said.They stood there having gotten out of vehicles to greet Clarke.They used vehicles like the Ark people did. Unlike the people from the tribes who used horses.The thirty people that came forward to greet Clarke Clarke could feel them as soon as they approached and she shivered at feeling their connection.She remembered feeling something powerful getting closer to her when she had been younger. She hadnt understood what it had been then but she knew what it had to have been now.It had been the feeling of her mates getting close when they had first arranged the deal with Abby.Clarke faced her thirty mates and felt the connection hit feeling like multiple bolts of lightning struck her.These were her mates alright. She could feel it.Clarke fought another shiver when she saw each of them stare at her wanting with sly emerald brown hazel and blue eyes many of them smirking.Hello Clarke one of the women said stepping forward Its good to see you again. Im sure Abby has explained who we are to you. Now I know this is a lot to expect of you on such short notice. But we need you to come with us alright sweetie I promise it will all make sense later.Clarke tried not to snort at the statement she just heard.She would go with her mates to wherever they were going to take her. But she seriously doubted that any of this would make sense to her.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/50060422,Joining Forces,The first patient died so quickly that Clarke Griffin had no time to even devise a treatment plan never mind begin one.She was an older woman from one of the Arks minor stations and by the time she stumbled into the med bay she was so sick that all Clarkes efforts to lower her soaring body temperature were in vain. No more than thirty minutes after she first appeared the woman was dead.Clarke felt panic begin to set in then certain that any virus so virulent and so fastacting must also be highly contagious. She feared it was already too late but still insisted that she and Harper McIntyre the nurse whod been on duty with her must quarantine for 48 hours.Ill monitor us she explained to the terrified Harper. Well catch it before it gets that bad.Meanwhile Clarkes mother Dr. Abby Griffin used the patients ID to try to track down her family. As it turned out the efforts of both women were wasted. Ida Fowler had lived alone and had no family or even close friends. As for Clarke and Harper not a single symptom ever appeared not so much as a sniffle or a sore throat.When they emerged from quarantine two days later Clarke was as puzzled as she was relieved. She insisted on doing some careful testing of Idas body but could find no signs of a virus. When after a week she was no closer to a solution the Council insisted that the body had to be floated.You know its not healthy to keep a corpse on the Ark Abby told her. I couldnt find anyone who was close to Ida but everyone who knew her said she liked to drink. So maybe she was just particularly vulnerable to this diseaseA disease that then just disappeared without a traceAbby sighed and Clarke understood that her own frustration was shared. But as always there were limits to both the Arks knowledge and its resources.The Council thinks we should let this go Clarke and I have to agree with them.Clarke knew it was ultimately her decision of course. When Abby had become Chancellor a couple of years earlier shed ceded the position of Chief Medical Officer to her daughter. The only other candidate had been Eric Jackson and hed claimed hed rather continue to hone his surgical skills and leave the administrative duties to Clarke. So she had the authority to fight the Council on this if shed wanted to.But really what was the pointThey scheduled the funeral for the following day and Clarke forced herself to attend just in case someone showed up to mourn the luckless Ida but no one did. She steeled herself against that moment when the body was whisked out the airlock reminding her as it always did of her own fathers funeral.Five years earlier Jake Griffin had had a heart attack so massive that he was dead before he hit the floor. She and her mother had each grieved in their own way Clarke throwing herself into her medical duties while Abby became more and more involved with running the Ark eventually becoming Chancellor.Today as she made her way back from the airlock to the med bay Clarke again reminded herself that she might easily have lost her father even earlier. Even a decade later she still remembered the terrible arguments shed overheard between Abby and Jake with her dad insisting that the Ark was running out of oxygen and that everyone needed to be told.Abby had been frantic. You cant tell people Jake even if its true. Theyll just panic. And the Council will see it as treason and float you. Please please at least redo your calculations before you take a step that cant be undone.Clarke had been torn between understanding her dads desire for transparency and fearing for his life.But then he had rechecked the equipment and redone the math and this time he found that perhaps the CO scrubbers could be repaired. And that since the population of the Ark was steadily declining maybe theyd be okay after all.At least for a while.Ten years had passed since those harrowing days and while shed lost her dad only a few years later shed always been grateful for those last years with him. Jake had been so proud when she finished her medical training training that had allowed her to step up when Abby became a parttime doctor and a fulltime Chancellor.By the time she got back to the med bay Clarke had resolved to put the mystery of Ida Fowlers illness out of her mind and for two weeks she succeeded. Then Robert Orton a big burly tattooed guy from Factory Station came in with a violent headache. It took a little longer this time but in the end it didnt matter. He was still just as dead.Clarke and Harper quarantined again less worried this time while Abby once more launched a discreet investigation into the patient. The results had been much the same. Clarke and Harper never got sick and no one knew much about Robert Orton. No one missed him much either. Hed been a bully and a loner and his death mostly sparked a fight over whod take over his relatively decent living quarters.Clarke tested even more thoroughly this time taking the trouble to do fullbody scans but found nothing helpful. Four days later Ortons body was pushed out the airlock and consigned to the great beyond.She didnt bother attending that funeral.When a month went by and no more cases appeared Clarke began to breathe more easily. But then on a slow Tuesday morning Daria and Magnus Watson showed up at the med bay and as soon as she saw them Clarke knew it wasnt over after all.At first she thought they were both sick and that maybe there was a new symptom when it looked like Daria had some bruising on her wrists and arms.Thats nothing the woman insisted pulling her sleeves down over her wrists. My husbands the sick one. I practically had to carry him here from Farm Station. Youre gonna help him rightWell do our best Clarke said. But his fever was still climbing despite all their efforts and she tried very hard not to get the womans hopes up.But this was also the first time shed had anyone to question about the onset of the illness.When did Magnus start getting sick Daria What were the first symptomsThe woman shrugged distracted her face a mask of fear. What I dont know. I was working the night shift at the hydroponic farm and when I got home this morning he wasnt asleep like usual. And he was complaining about his foot. Then he started to shake like crazy and I didnt know what to do so I brought him here.His foot What about his foot Left or rightWhat does it matter now Cant you see hes burning upWere doing everything we can to bring down his fever Daria but it could be important. So please which foot Left or rightDaria sighed her eyes never leaving her husband. It was his left foot I think. He was hopping around a bit. Something about his toes.His toes. Clarke frowned. What the hell kind of disease started in the toesHed stopped thrashing about by now but she feared it wasnt an improvement but instead the lethargy that often preceded death.But his legs were still when she flipped up the thin blanket that covered his left foot and began a visual examination of his toes searching for an infection. But it wasnt until she went over the entire area a second time with a handheld magnifying glass that she found it. Not an infection at all but a tiny hole just at the crease of his big toe. As soon as she saw it Clarke knew exactly what it was.An injection site.XXXXXXXXXXThats why Harper and I never got sick Mom. This virus isnt passed from person to person its injected right into the bloodstream.Are you sure Clarke Abbys face said she couldnt quite bring herself to believe such a thing.Positive. Once I found the point of injection on Magnus Watson I was able to test the blood from the area at the site and I could see the viral cells. But when I checked his blood again later after hed died the virus had completely disappeared again.But how can that be Ive never heard of such a virus. Where the hell did it come fromAll the same questions Ive been asking myself. But also who the hell is doing this That injection didnt get there by itself.Clarke could hear the grimness in her voice but she didnt know how else to react. Someone was deliberately killing people. Three had died so far but who was to say how many more thered be if they couldnt figure it out If they couldnt find a way to stop him. Or her.Abby sighed nodding. Right. Then I guess its a good thing I asked David Miller to meet with us here.And as if shed conjured him up there was a sudden knock at the Chancellors door and a moment later the Head of the Guard joined them.David you remember my daughter Clarke.Of course he said genially.Its nice to see you Chief Miller.He smiled. Oh I think the Chief Medical Officer can call me David.She smiled in return. David. So hows Mill uh Nate doingMiller laughed. Im well aware that my son hates his given name and prefers to be called Miller. As a matter of fact hes doing well since he finally stopped being an idiot. Hes making a career in the Guard too so the name thing sometimes leads to confusion. But if thats my chief worry where my son is concerned Ill take it.Im glad everything worked out for him.Miller nodded. And thats in no small part thanks to you Clarke and that campaign you waged to decriminalize minor offenses. You were barely more than a kid yourself back then but so determined. And I know she had your support on that Abby he added turning to her mother so whatever either of the Griffin women need right now you can consider it done.Abby sighed. If only it were that simple David. Some small favor we needed. But Im afraid its rather more than that. I think youd better take a seat before you hear what Clarke has to say.Clarke launched into her story then and as Miller listened she watched the expression on his face change from confusion to concern until he finally gaped her in horror.So what youre telling me here is that someone is injecting our people with a deadly and untraceable virus.Yes. Exactly.And none of those patients the three who died have anything to do with one another.She shook her head. Not that we know of.Miller sighed. You know after that coup attempt years ago I thought Id seen it all. And yes weve had the occasional killing. But those were always personal. One way or another. But what youre telling me now is that the Ark has a serial killer on its hands.Clarke gave a start. A serial killer Shed never thought of it like that but of course he was right.I can provide more detailsHold that thought Clarke he interrupted pulling out his comm device and punching in a number. No sense in you going through it twice.She watched as someone answered his call.You available Captain Yeah well you can do the fitness reports some other time. Right now I need you to get yourself up to the Chancellors office Yep thats what I said the Chancellors office What No you dont need to bring anyone else. Just you.Miller nodded as he ended the call.I just appointed a new detective captain and hes a brilliant young guy. Got a brain that I think is particularly wellsuited to investigative work so hes just the person you need to work with you on this Clarke. He huffed a dry laugh. Although I dont think either of us ever expected this was the kind of investigating hed be doing.In less time than Clarke might have expected there was another knock on the door and Millers newlyminted captain stepped into the room. Clarkes first thought when she saw him was that it couldnt be. It just couldnt. But there was David Miller clapping the man on the shoulder smiling as he made the introductions.Chancellor Griffin Dr. Clarke Griffin this is Captain Bellamy Blake.Blakes eyes barely skimmed across her mother before they locked firmly onto Clarke and she knew that the shock on his face was probably reflected on her own.She hadnt seen Bellamy Blake in nearly a decade and had had no idea what happened to him. But shed never forget those eyes. How theyd bored into her with a contempt that was just this side of hatred. How she still hadnt been able to look away from him.Just like she couldnt look away today.XXXXXXXXXX Clarke had barely gotten over her fears about her father when the scandal broke. She was just starting to breathe easier knowing that Jake Griffin wasnt going to be floated for passing on government secrets and that the Ark wasnt going run out of oxygen after all when she heard the news. It was Wells who told her. Did you hear about the illegal girl Illegal girl How can a person be illegal Shes a second child Clarke. You know thats strictly forbidden. Oh. Still to call her illegal Wells sighed in exasperation. Okay her status is illegal. Hows that Clarke nodded. Better. So how did that happen Wells smirked. In the usual way I imagine. Clarke rolled her eyes. Dont be an ass Wells. I mean wheres she been all this time Whos her mother Some seamstress down in Factory Station. My dad said they hid her under the floor. Under the floor Oh my god Wells finally showed some empathy. Yeah that does sound pretty bad. So how old is she Like four or five or something Shes sixteen. Sixteen But how did her family even keep her a secret all that time Wells shrugged. No idea. Besides her mother theres just a brother. Hes in the Guard or at least he was. So whats going to happen to them all For some reason that she couldnt quite understand her sympathies were aroused by this family in distress. People she didnt even know and probably never would have known since they lived down in Factory. Wells shrugged. Pretty sure the mothers going to be floated. Onechild is one of our strictest rules. Not sure about the brother. Dad said he was just a little kid when his sister was born and cant be held responsible. But he wont keep his place in the Guard. And the girl It was her story that had really touched Clarkes heart. This girl who was only a year younger than she was and had known only a life in hiding. Whats going to happen to her Shes going to the Skybox. What Clarke jumped up so fast she nearly toppled the table and Wellss chess set with it. No no no no no They cant lock her up just for for existing She didnt do anything wrong it was her mother Yeah but shes uh her status is still illegal. The Council cant ignore that Why the hell not They could have a little sympathy A little understanding Theres no way that girl should be going to the Skybox. The more she thought about it the more upset she became. So upset that instead of retaking her seat she turned and headed for the door. Clarke Wherere you going We havent finished our game. But she just shook her head knowing that Wells was puzzled by her interest in this unknown girl. In truth she didnt quite understand it herself. All she knew was that she had to try to help her because she was pretty damn sure no one else would. XXXXXXXXXX Its out of my hands Clarke. Abby was very definite about that. But it cant be Mom. Youre on the Council. Cant you I dont knowmake a pitch that maybe theres another way of handling the situation than putting this poor girl in the Skybox Clarke was doubly glad then that her dad hadnt provoked the Council that the Griffin family and Abby Griffin in particular still had some clout. Now she just had to persuade her mother to use it. Ive only been on the Council for a little while but the rest of them were pretty adamant that they had to show a strong response to this set a precedent Why Do they think there are other illegal kids hiding under floors all over the Ark Who told you about the floor Abby sighed. Never mind I suppose it was Wells. Look I think the point is that the Ark only has a certain amount of resources Yeah and if she wasnt about to be floated for having a second child her mother would be eating and drinking and breathing all those resources So why cant her daughter use them instead Abby reached out to stroke Clarkes arm. You have such a kind heart Clarke. And Im proud of you for that. But you know everyone has to pull their weight on the Ark. Can this girl do that Well she sure cant do it in the Skybox Abby shrugged. Youre right of course. But then she looked thoughtful. I dont know maybe there is something that can be done. But there would have to be a definite plan before I could even think of bringing this to the Council. Let me talk to her Mom. See what shes like see what she could offer the Ark. Please she begged when Abby continued to look skeptical. Where is she right now Shes in a holding cell for the moment. Her mother is scheduled to be floated the day after tomorrow and the girl has the right to be there so she hasnt been processed into the Skybox yet. Then theres still a chance for her. Please you have to let me try. In the end Abby gave in securing permission for Clarke to visit the girl but sternly reminding her not to make any promises. We dont want to give her false hopes. No of course not Clarke agreed readily. Now I just need to know her name. Abby looked surprised. Wells didnt tell you that Its Octavia. Octavia Blake. Her brothers called Bellamy and their mother is Aurora. XXXXXXXXXX When she arrived Octavia Blake was sitting in a chair in the far corner of the holding cell and Clarke got the feeling she was more used to and perhaps more comfortable in small spaces. She was a pretty girl with long dark hair and lovely features but the green eyes looked sad and it was hardly a mystery why that was. Whore you she asked as soon as the door opened. Are you bringing me a message from Bellamy Hello Octavia Im Clarke Griffin. No Im sorry I havent spoken to your brother. Octavia seemed to deflate. Then whatre you doing here I just thought maybe we could have a chat. Is it okay if I sit down Octavia shrugged and Clarke took a seat on the only other available surface Octavias cot. So I suppose you want to ask me the same questions as everyone else. Whats it like to have to hide under the floor Whats it like being a person who shouldnt exist Clarke was appalled to think anyone had actually asked her those questions. No no nothing like that. We can talk about anything you want. Um why dont you tell me about your brother. You were looking for a message from him so I imagine youre pretty close. Whats he like Octavias face lit up with a smile then and in the blink of an eye she went from being merely pretty to absolutely beautiful. Bell is hes great. I dont know what brothers are supposed to be like but mines always been so good to me. Since I couldnt go to school we had lessons at home and he taught me how to read and write and do math. He loves mythology so he was always telling me stories about Zeus and Athena and Cerberus the threeheaded dog. He likes history too. He even named me after the sister of a Roman emperor. Augustus. He told me all about the Romans and the Greeks She paused. I just I miss him so much. And now hes lost his place in the Guard and its all my fault. He brought me to that dance because he wanted to do something nice for me and then they started checking IDs and look what happened. She stopped again sighing heavily. Clarke was astonished. Whatever shed thought she might hear from this girl it hadnt been tales of an adoring older brother whod also been her teacher and her entertainer. Or that the familys ultimate downfall had come from him wanting to give his sister a treat. So he Bellamy he taught you everything then Well not everything. My my mother Her eyes closed briefly as she choked back a sob and her face took on a look of weary acceptance. My mother taught me how to sew Do you sew well Clarke interrupted eagerly as a plan suddenly began to form in her head. Octavia shrugged frowning. Well yeah. Thats how we earned enough to feed me. I guess we were just lucky no one ever figured out how Mom could get so much work done So you might be able to work as a seamstress too Clarke I am a seamstress. She frowned. Why do you need something fixed Or a new dress Clarke shook her head. No no nothing like that. Why dont you tell me more about yourself Octavia. Anything you want to talk about. Well I like music and I like to dance she said immediately. Thats why Bell brought me to that masquerade dance. And sometimes I like to draw As Octavia opened up to her Clarke began to realize what a remarkable girl she was and what a remarkable brother she must have. Her hopes began to rise that she really could sway the Council into letting the girl live with her brother instead of being confined to the Skybox. But shed only been granted an hour with Octavia and before she knew it that time was up. I have to go now she said when the guard appeared to end the visit. But Ill try to come back tomorrow. Will you Octavia said her face full of hope. Id really like that. Ive never had a girl my own age to talk to before. Im really going to try my best Clarke told her jumping up to give her an impetuous hug before the guard could kick her out. She raced back to Alpha Station more determined than ever. XXXXXXXXXX Never in her life had Clarke fought so hard for something that would have no effect on her own life. And it felt good She had grown up knowing she was privileged understanding that not everyone on the Ark had the same advantages she did. It was why she worked so hard at her studies and was so determined to become a good doctor. But all that was somehow impersonal. Good works she could do to help others in need. Treat their illnesses. Make them feel better. This was different because she wasnt using her medical skills but her own personal influence to make life easier for someone less fortunately situated. In the end with Abbys help she managed to sway the Council. The vote was surprising because shed been so sure that Diana Sydney who represented some of the lower stations would be sympathetic and that Marcus Kane who was always a hardass about following the letter of the law wouldnt. But as it turned out it was exactly the opposite. As long as shes a productive member of the Ark Kane remarked and supports herself with her sewing skills then perhaps she could be allowed to live with her brother. Others of my constituents on Factory Station might feel she got special treatment Sydney objected. Just because she had an influential advocate. Jaha turned to her in surprise. And perhaps she should get special treatment Diana. Unlike your usual contingent of thieves and brawlers this entire situation is not of her making. So I vote we allow Octavia Blake to take her mothers place in both work and resources as Clarke has suggested. Clarke could hardly believe it. With the Chancellors vote in favor Octavia would now be allowed to go home. She jumped up excitedly. May I be allowed to tell her Jaha smiled at her. I think that would be appropriate. Ill make a call to the guards to let you in. You did come back Octavia said smiling when Clarke appeared in her doorway a little later. I wasnt sure Of course I did Clarke said grinning from ear to ear. And I have good news. Good news Octavia said the words as though the concept of good news was utterly foreign to her. Yes. Youre not going to the Skybox after all Octavia. Youre going to be allowed to live with your brother as long as you work as a seamstress. Octavia looked stunned as though she could hardly believe it. And my mother Oh god. Im so sorry Octavia theres just no chance the Council will change their minds about your mother. The onechild policy is their strictest rule. Octavia nodded her shoulders slumping. Its just what she always said would happen. And its still going to be tomorrow Clarke nodded. Yes. Youll be kept here until then but afterwards you can go home with Will you come Clarke blinked. What Will you come with me tomorrow when theywhen they float my mother I dont want to be alone. But surely your brother Bellamy Yeah Im sure hell be there but hes so angry Clarke. And he feels so guilty. We both do. But I cant imagine what itll be like and Im afraid. She paused choking. It would just be comforting to have someone else there with me. Clarke sighed as Octavias words resonated with her It wasnt so long ago that shed been almost overwhelmed with fear that her own father would be floated. Of course Ill come if thats what you want. Ill be here a half hour ahead of time and we can walk down together. Octavia looked relieved. Thank you Clarke. And thank you for getting me out of the Skybox. It wasnt me Octavia it was the Council that voted And who gave them the idea Who talked them into it Because before you came along itd been all settled that I was going to the Skybox. You dont have to tell me if you dont want to but Im not stupid. I know you must have had something to do with them not locking me up. This time it was Octavia who reached out for a hug. The important thing is that youre going home Clarke said hugging her back. Clarke didnt sleep well that night. Shed never even been to a funeral let alone a criminal floating and the next day when her mother saw how anxious she was she tried to persuade Clarke not to go after all. I cant let Octavia down she insisted although she did gratefully accept Abbys offer to accompany them. But a last minute medical emergency made that impossible. So Clarke was on her own in her role as friend of the family. By the time the girls made their way from the holding cell to the airlock anteroom Aurora Blake was already there accompanied by a couple of guards and she appeared to be calmly awaiting her fate. Chancellor Jaha required by Ark law to carry out the sentence was there as well and nodded to Clarke as she and Octavia entered the room. It was nearly the appointed time when the door suddenly burst open and a man rushed in hurtling past the others to embrace Aurora. Clarke could hear his choked words. Mom Im so sorry And his mothers forgiving ones. Bellamy none of this is your fault. Beside her she heard Octavia mutter tearfully Thank god he made it. She got her first good look at Bellamy Blake then as he turned fully in their direction to gaze at his sister. Clarkes breath caught in her throat and she berated herself for her completely inappropriate response to Octavias brother. The man was about to lose his mother dammit And she was she was She closed her eyes willing away the attraction. Then it was Octavias turn to embrace her mother to say her last goodbyes. When she was finally forced to move away she grabbed onto Clarkes arm while Bellamy stood alone rigid and unmoving. And then Aurora Blake stepped into the airlock and turned for a last sorrowful glance at her loved ones as the door clicked shut behind her. Jaha pulled the switch immediately because even Clarke knew it was a kindness not to drag the moment out. And if she was shocked and horrified as the body was blasted from the airlock she could only imagine how painful it must be for the son and daughter. For several tense moments no one moved and then Jaha left motioning to the guards to follow. An instant later Bellamy Blake turned his head and seemed to realize for the very first time that someone else was in that room. Who the fuck are you he said hotly clearly angry that an interloper had been present at what he might have expected would be a private moment. They sending little girls to guard my sister these days Or maybe you just get off on seeing people floated. Venom dripped off every word and Clarke stood there mouth agape unable to conjure up a single word to explain herself. But Octavia tried on her behalf. No Bell you dont understand. I asked Clarke to be here because shes my friend. She helped me Your friend How the fuck can you be so gullible Octavia I can tell just by looking at this bitchs shiny hair and new clothes that shes one of the elite. One of those same parasites who made Mom miserable every day of her life and then ended it by fucking floating her. Youve got it all wrong Bell The hell I do Im the only friend youve got O. Youre my responsibility. But goddammit I cant figure out a way to get you out of this Clarke saw the tears in his eyes then and for a moment she thought they might fall. But when he glanced her way again and his face hardened she knew hed be damned before hed cry in front of her. Im so sorry O he said finally. Ive gotta go now but Ill try to get permission to visit you in the Skybox. He wrapped his sister in a brief hug while shifting his head to pin Clarke with a look of utter contempt. No one had ever looked at her with such disdain but somehow she couldnt seem to look away. He was gone then before either of them could say another word. Before they could make him understand that hed gotten everything completely wrong. And that he wouldnt need permission to see Octavia after all. XXXXXXXXXXFor nearly ten years Clarke hadnt been able to forget that venomous glance. It was what had kept her from pursuing a further friendship with Octavia although shed checked up on the girl from time to time happy to hear that she was getting along well.As for Bellamy Blake she hadnt seen him or heard anything about him since five minutes after his mother was floated. Nor had she ever expected to. And she certainly couldnt have anticipated that hed become a captain in the Guard or the person whod be tasked with helping her solve a difficult and dangerous problem.She studied him now searching for any signs of change that the past decade might have wrought in him. His back was straighter and his gaze cooler but otherwise he seemed much the same.Disturbingly so was her reaction to him.She took a quick breath. What was there about this man that so attracted herFor a moment Captain Blake gazed back at her with a slightly bewildered expression but then his face cleared and he nodded slowly as he said stiffly I think that perhaps I owe you an apology.,Explicit,An Ark storytakes place in the canon universe but 10 years laterthey are all still on the ArkDoctor ClarkeGuard BellamyMurder MysteryCanon DivergentEventual sexy times so mind the rating

https://archiveofourown.org/works/43063080,What More Can I Do,CH 1 Anya stood around the noisy club holding a ginger beer. It wasnt her preferred way to spend the evening but it had been a while since they had gone anywhere. She owed Luna a night out. At least that.Her mindless staring was interrupted by a sudden pawing against her arm. Her reflexes almost got the best of her before she noticed who was grabbing her.The girl was mesmerizing. A bit shorter than her dark hair tied up in a perfect ponytail and red lips to match her red leather jacket. Dark eyes smiled mischievously as she gripped her arm as if using her for balance. Anya noticed a sleek cane in her other hand. Play along She whispered before slapping her arm and laughing at nothing.What Anya did not typically like being touched by strangers but this particular stranger had some kind of immunity.Oh God hes coming this way she grunted ignoring Anyas confusion and offering a quick explanation. Its my ex he does not get the hint.Maybe you should be more directOh. Em. Geee Her laugh phony as it was elicited a little flutter inside of Anya. It was something she had not felt in a long time. SO funnyRaven hey A floppy haired boy appeared in front of them out of nowhere. Ive been trying to get your attention all night.Oh Raven turned to look at him still clasping onto Anyas arm. Finn. I didnt realize you were here.Whos this He ran his hand through his hair eyeing them both up and down.That was all Anya needed.She placed an arm around the girls shoulders around Ravens shoulders. Im her girlfriend. Who are youOh the response took him off guard it may have taken Raven off guard too but she recovered quickly flashing a smile her way as Finn regained his composure. I didnt realize... I hope this isnt too awkward for you.Why would it be Anya shrugged nonchalantly as Raven positioned herself closer.Im Finn. He stated as if Anya hadnt heard their earlier exchange.Doesnt ring a bell.Raven and I he began to state coolly we used to Babe Anya turned to the girl who was absolutely beaming now. Has this guy been bothering youNah she waved a hand and placed it over Anyas sitting over her shoulder hes harmless.Before either of them could respond her actual girlfriend had returned from the bathroom. She walked between them and gave her a curious look.Making friends babeAnya noticed Ravens eyes widen as Luna waited for a response. Oh shit. Raven kicked herself for not realizing her target had a girlfriend. Of course she did look at her Though to be fair it had not been her intention to pretend to be dating her that was all cheekbones over here.The other girl somehow taller and just as gorgeous looked between them. Her wild red mane and curious brown eyes fit together in beautiful contrast to her girlfriends blonde partial braids and fierce hazel stare. Was she upset Would she kick her ass Or worse would she humiliate her in front of FinnMaking friends babeThere was a flash of uncertainty in the taller girls eyes. Raven noticed a silent conversation happening between them before cheekbones responded.Hey babe. Just some guy Rae used to know.Raven squirmed at the nickname. Wait what is going on here Finn scoffed. I thought you were her girlfriend. Are you fucking with me Raven You dont have to lie cuz youre still single.Youre right the lioness stood between them there has been a misunderstanding. Anya is my girlfriend.Raven closed her eyes preparing for the humiliation And Ravens. She looked over at her fondly and caressed her cheek before turning back to Finn smirking. And I am too.WhaNow if youll excuse us she took Ravens free hand we were heading to our table. Bye Tom.Yeah bye Tom Anya sneered at him as the three of them walked away together. Its... Finn. Raven started talking at them as soon as they sat down.Oh my God. I am so sorry I didnt mean to try to steal your girlfriend honestly I just didnt know Finn was going to be here and I really didnt want to talk to him and I thought I could just lose him but thenLuna thought she was adorable.No the rambling was adorable but Raven She was something else. The confidence she exuded those sexy full lips that smile she thought Raven was stunning. Maybe this would be a fun night after all.Not that she was expecting anything from Raven or from Anya. The two of them hadnt picked up anyone in a long time. They hadnt done much of anything in a long time. This had been a rare night out and it hadnt been going all that great so far. So when she came out of the bathroom and saw her girlfriend being approached by the beautiful girl sitting between them now she had watched curiously to see how she would react.Luna knew Anya was not okay with being touched by people she didnt know well unless she was sparring. She was good at offense and defense not great at being open and vulnerable. But she had been so soft with Raven.Its okay Luna winked. I dont mind.Raven raised an eyebrow at her while Anya continued to just stare at her silently.I was watching from afar Luna continued. Dude looked like a creep. We tend to be in agreement about how to engage in those situations.Oh. Raven nodded. Luna thought there was a moment of disappointment on her face before she continued. Finns not all bad. At least he didnt used to be.I have to know. Luna quickly changed the subject. She didnt want to hear about any redeeming qualities the boy had. He was obviously not deserving of Raven. Why did you decide to go up to AnyaHonestlyYes. Anya sat up expectantly. She was just as intrigued.You looked kinda intimidating. I thought maybe youd scare Finn away.Luna howled She does tend to have that affectAnya scowled at her unamused by the reaction.Oh cmon babe. Luna poked her playfully hoping she didnt hurt her sensitive girlfriends feelings. I know youre sweet as pie but you do tend to scare people off with that very charming scowl.Im not sweet. And I didnt scare Raven off Anya leaned her head on her hand and went back to staring at their new friend. Did IWell... No. Raven admitted softly I think the scowl is kinda sexy.Oh yeah Anya smiled playfully almost shy.Luna watched eagerly. She like when Anya flirted.Raven looked between them biting her lip.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/40001133,Clexa Werewolves,As the bell rang Clarke took her seat third row center flanked on either side by the only two popular girls in honors English.Like so many of the decisions Clarke made where she sat was a strategic choice.Third row center put her directly in the teachers line of sight but she wouldnt look quite as overeager as she would if she sat in the front row.It was bad enough that she was in all honors classes. Sitting in the front row would only get her branded as even more of a nerd.And she was at a new high school and had a new rep to build.Clarke had been sticking to her plan of only raising her hand to answer every third question her teachers asked rather than eagerly waving her hand in the air at every single one.Though sometimes she pretended not to be paying attention at all so the teachers would call on her more.But she was still a novice at that little trick.Lexa on the other hand had mastered it.Day after day she sat in the back row hunched over a book seeming to ignore the class entirely.But when the teachers called on her Lexa always gave the right answer or made an interesting comment to distract from the fact that she hadnt barely even bothering to look up from her book and extend their teachers the basic human courtesy of eye contact.Clarke found that very annoying.And even worse Lexa was in all of Clarkes honors classes. Always slumped over a book in the back row. Always in the seat closest to the door. Always dressed in her torn black jeans and black tshirts for various bands. Indifference wafting off of her like bad cologne.But somehow despite her careless attitude several of their teachers seemed to have chosen Lexa as their favorite.And that frustrated Clarke to no end.Clarke was aiming to be the top student in all her classes. She wanted letters of recommendation from her teachers that would be positively incandescent with praise. Letters that would help her get into a top university. She could barely contain her desire for their approval.She could justify to herself having to compete with Lexa for the top spot in her other classes biology history and math classes with multiple choice tests that had single right answers and only required basic memorization skills to get right.But English required creativity something Clarke prided herself on. Something she excelled at. Or at least she thought she did ... Lexa made her question that.Week after week she turned in her seat and watched jealously as her English teacher handed back Lexas essays with a big smile on her face heaping praises on Lexa for her insightfulness. Acting like Lexa had done her some huge favor by allowing her to grade it.Even from several seats away Clarke could see the As emblazoned on Lexas papers. Could see all the praise written in red pen in the margins.Clarkes papers seemed positively bare by comparison. They had those same As but her work didnt seem to inspire anywhere near the enthusiasm that Lexas did. Clarke only got a little smile and nod with her returned papers as if shed just done what was expected of her. As if she hadnt stayed up late night after night sweating over them.She watched with her forehead crinkled in annoyance as Lexa took her papers from the English teachers outstretched hand a sly grin on her face calling their teacher by her first name returning the praise with flattery about what an amazing teacher she was. Flattery delivered in a flirtatious tone and that made their teacher blush.Clarke wasnt the only student who noticed that either.They were just two months into their senior year and Clarke had already heard the rumor going around that Lexa was fucking their English teacher.Clarke was pretty sure it was just homophobic slander. But Lexa wasnt doing a very good job of hiding the fact that shed been blazing a trail through the senior girls.And that definitely wasnt the kind of attention she should be drawing to herself.Clarke was certain Lexas parents had given her the same speech Clarke had gotten from her mom about fitting in and not drawing attention to their more wolfish qualities.If they were going to attend a human high school it was essential that they blend in.Clarke had a vague memory of meeting Lexas parents once when she was little. Her mom and dad had taken her to a local park for a picnic and Gustus and Indra the two straightbacked leaders from the Trikru pack had shown up dressed like generals with little Lexa in tow. Two of their bodyguards had stood in the parking lot by the black SUV theyd arrived in. When theyd gotten out of the car Clarke had watched with a smirk on her face as Indra futzed with little Lexas braids and Gustus straightened the collar of her starched white button down a shirt it looked like they had forced Lexa to wear. They were clearly grooming her to be a pack leader like them.Gustus and Indra turning up at the same place at the same time was probably something her mom had arranged. Some sort of informal social event aimed at trying to bridge the massive divide between their two neighboring werewolf clans. It was the only such event in Clarkes lifetime.And it only took a glance at Gustus and Indras leather uniforms at their stiff posture to see that they were all about discipline and propriety. They looked even more uptight than Clarkes mom if that was even possible.And Clarke was pretty sure Lexas parents wouldnt love the fact that their daughter had been hooking up with a not insignificant number of the girls at their human high school in the bathrooms and under the bleachers.Clarke herself had slammed her locker shut and glared at Lexa as a little reminder of that fact when Lexa had pressed one of their classmates against a locker right next to hers for a heated midmorning makeout sesh just before Bio.Lexa had just smirked at her her green eyes glinting with wolfishness and Clarke watched as the girl pulled Lexa back against her with force and continued to making out with her as if Clarke wasnt standing right there. Clarke had just rolled her eyes and strode away from the absolute cloud of alpha pheromones Lexa was giving off. It was so strong Clarke could taste it for the rest of the day no matter how furiously she rinsed her mouth out.She knew Lexa couldnt exactly help the fact that people were attracted to her.All werewolves are hot.Clarkes own pack was filled with werewolves who were a dozen different flavors of hot. Wolves that were each charming and seductive in their own way. And though all that allure was meant for each other for attracting mates of their own kind humans were definitely not immune.But as Clarke knew as all werewolves knew it was a quality that had to be carefully managed to avoid attracting the villagers with their pitchforks. Flaunting their wolfish sex appeal just attracted the endless moralizing that humans used to justify their prejudices and mask their jealousy.Clarke had found acceptable outlets for her own wolfish qualities at school. She had scoped out a few of the popular boys who smelled harmless and friendly to be her playthings. The debate team was her outlet for her competitive drive. And shed joined the cheerleading squad as an outlet for her unquenchable need for a pack and physical exertion. It was a sport where she could use her inhuman strength and reflexes to excel and where she wouldnt accidentally maul a competitor.Lexa had opted for soccer. On the one hand it was a decent cover for why the girl who was always hunched over a book in the back of class had perfect posture and was covered with rippling muscles.But in Clarkes opinion Lexa taking part in any competitive sport was a huge mistake.As an omega with many alpha qualities herself Clarke knew that competitive sports were too much of a trigger created too big a risk of her blue eyes turning violet and her canines sprouting into fangs.For Lexa an alpha werewolf playing competitive sports with humans was just begging for trouble.From her spot on the bleachers during a break from cheerleading practice Clarkes sensitive ears had picked up Lexas roaring growl at one of her teammates on the field. Even from fifty feet away she could sense that Lexas green eyes had turned gold and were glinting with fury probably from something as simple as a teammates accidental shove on the soccer field.If Lexa couldnt keep it together with her own teammates god only knew how she was handling the packs of assholes who roamed the halls harassing people.And the last thing Clarke needed was for Lexa to lose it one day shift into her wolf form and tear some asshole to pieces because he had taken her backpack or cut in front of her in the lunch line.Every little misstep from Lexa felt like a personal slight to her. A risk that they would be outed to their classmates. And the last thing anyone needed was for the people in this town to discover that they were just miles away from two giant werewolf clans.Unlike most of the teens in their packs who were homeschooled by their clans she and Lexa had been sent to this high school to hone their skills at dealing with humans and because it offered the kinds of honors classes and extracurriculars that looked good on applications to top universities. Once there they would get the kinds of degrees that would be useful to their packs and would help them fulfill their destinies as leaders.All they had to do was exercise some basic self control and not bite anyone or shift. Well that and not go on a sex spree that drew too much attention to themselves. That should be easy enough. If they wanted an actual good time they could fool around with the members of their own packs.And Clarkes mom had thought ahead. Abby had gotten Clarke an implant that suppressed her heats and helped keep her omega drives under control.Sure Clarke got a lot more growly during her time of the month. But her mom had been grooming her for leadership since she was a pup. Clarke had learned to shove that deep desire to howl and snarl way down deep and just smile sweetly at all the little annoyances that made her want to shred people and objects to pieces during her time of the month. And she could always shift freely and revel in her primal drives when she was at home with her pack after school and on weekends.But what shed been having much more trouble controlling was her reactions to Lexas ruts the alpha version of heats.Lexa seemed to be doing things the old fashioned way and Clarke could smell her alpha pheromones everywhere at school all the time.Clarke knew what Lexa was doing. Flooding the school with her scent. Marking their high school as her territory. It was a provocation. And it was also so fucking childish. But whatever. Clarke could deal with that part. This was a human place after all and Clarke was making it her territory in the only ways that actually mattered. Popularity. Student government. Good grades. Dominating in her extracurriculars.But when Lexas ruts were approaching her scent was almost unbearable.And being in all of Lexas classes meant that Clarke had a front row seat for Lexas approaching ruts. Even with her implant suppressing her omega drives the musky allure of Lexas scent the scent of cinnamon and cedar of musk and strength made Clarkes mouth water. And of course more often than not Lexa also reeked of sex.That was the time of the month when Lexa received the highest number of glares from Clarke. Glares accompanied by arched eyebrows that said Why do you smell like sex at 900 in the morning Glares that Lexa answered with a smirk. Glares that got increasingly more intense as the day wore on glares that said Seriously Again Its not even noonNone of the humans in class seemed to be aware of the cloud of pheromones pouring off Lexa when her rut was approaching.Clarke was the only one who spent those classes with her jaw clenched trying to suppress moans at the sound of Lexas voice lazily answering the teachers questions gripping her pens to the point of breaking them. Clarke was the only student who was carefully managing the 12 sick days shed been allotted so she could be absent on the days when the scent of Lexas rut was the strongest so she wouldnt do something foolish like accidentally rip off Lexas clothes and push her into a bathroom stall to have howling snarling sex with her.That was the worst part. Somehow she wasnt just smelling Lexas approaching ruts. She could fucking feel them.And Lexas occasional smirking glances were enough to make Clarke 1000 sure that Lexa was completely aware of that effect her scent was having. That Lexas keen eyes saw her squirming in her seat. That Lexas keen ears could hear her swallowing every two seconds so she didnt drown from how much Lexas smell had her salivating. That Lexas keen nose knew why she had to raise her hand for the bathroom pass in every class they had together when Lexas rut was approaching.She shot Lexas smug face looks of extreme annoyance as she marched out of class to go to the bathroom and deal with what Lexas pheromones were doing to her aching crotch. And unfortunately even in those few precious moments alone in the bathroom where the scent of Lexas approaching rut wasnt quite so overpowering her brain couldnt help but think of Lexas smug face as her fingers worked away desperately at her clit trying to get some fleeting relief.By October Clarke had started bringing extra pairs of underwear to school to deal with Lexas scent.This is bullshit Clarke had grumbled one afternoon throwing her backpack onto the kitchen table after a particularly exhausting week of dealing with the scent of Lexas approaching rut which had caused her to blow through three pairs of underwear in a single day.Cant you call Lexas parents Tell them to get her an implant or tell their daughter keep her damn pheromones under control Clarke growled pulling off her sweater which still smelled like Lexa.Honey Abby started sympathetically and in that tone that Clarke had already learned would end in No They dont make implants for alphas. And it takes time for alphas to learn to control their pheromones Lexa is still just a girl Clarke rolled her eyes Shes not just a girl mom she is most definitely a woman and of course you take her side fucking alpha solidarity Honey Abby started again I didnt get control over my pheromones until my 20s and most alphas never totally master them.This is bullshit Clarke huffed again plopping down on the couch next to her mom Shes messing up my gpa I had to give a presentation today and she just looked at me and let out a wave of musk right in the middle of it I forgot what I was saying just stood there looking like an idiotAbby smiled a little amused smile and patted her arm It cant be that bad Clarke Im sure shes trying.Yeah ... trying to drive me crazy Clarke grumbled The whole fucking school smells like her She was all over me today Wait Abbys eyes glinted gold She touched you Assaulted youClarke crossed her arms and huffed No she stays away. Shes assaulting my nose.Abby let out a breath Theres a steep learning curve for alphas during their teen years Then I need a stronger implant Clarke grumbled.Abby shook her head You have the strongest implant there is Clarke. I wasnt going to take any chances when it came to you Then its broken Clarke muttered not wanting to get into the details of how she could not only fucking smell Lexa but could fucking feel her too. It was humiliating. It was bad enough that Lexa was claiming the school with her scent. But the way Lexa was using her pheromones on her it was like Lexa was claiming Clarke too by destroying her underwear day after day.Abby raised an eyebrow Its definitely not broken Clarke. Youve seen how the other wolves your age get with their heats how we all get ...Clarke sighed and looked up at the ceiling. Maybe that was true. For all Lexas bullshit at least theyd never actually touched each other never even had a real conversation Though if Clarke hadnt talked Abby into letting her take a few mental health days each month when Lexas ruts fully hit who even knew what would have happened between them ...That implant is whats helping you stay focused on school which is what you need to be focusing on Abby continued Youre ability to focus to overcome challenges is why youre being groomed to lead the pack. Its why you will be the first omega elected pack leader someday. And you will overcome this challenge Clarke. You will develop the focus and self control you need to get past it and those will be invaluable skills when you are running this clan.Clarke sat up straighter.Abby had known just what to say.Leading the pack was Clarkes life goal her parents dream for her and her dream for herself. It was the thing she wanted most.When she was a little girl and Abby had first gotten elected to the council shed sat on her dads knee in the front row at every public council meeting.As she got older her parents talked with her more and more about the inner workings of the council about challenges the pack was facing opportunities to modernize. Shed volunteered in Abbys campaigns herself and went door to door discussing Abbys platform with the wolves in their pack.Clarke had spent countless hours daydreaming about what she would do when she was pack leader.When her father Jake had been a casualty of one of Jahas ridiculous missions she had learned first hand just how devastating terrible leadership could be for the wolves in her clan for their families and it cemented her resolve once and for all.And now that her mother had been elected pack leader to replace Jaha Abby looped her in on what it meant to be pack leader the things Clarke could accomplish the legacy Abby was building for her to improve things for her generation of wolves.Clarke knew that Jaha hadnt taken the loss lightly and was grooming his own successor to try and take back control.But fuck that.Jaha had destroyed her family. They were still devastated by the loss of Jake years later and always would be. Clarke and Abby had rebuilt their relationship piece by piece around their shared commitment to ensuring that that kind of reckless leadership didnt happen in Skykru again.Clarke had decided that human high school was going to be her first takeover. A seat in student government. Head of the debate team. Cheerleading squad.First shed take over human high school then college then shed get a seat on the council and then on to pack leader.Ill deal with it Clarke grumbled.Abby smiled and patted her knee I know you will Honey. And when you meet your mate you wont hate those pheromones nearly as much as you do right now Clarke rolled her eyes Please not the sex talk again. Ive had sex its not a big deal.Abby just laughed Trust me when you meet your mate its going to be a very big deal.Clarkes face scrunched she did not want to be talking about this with her mom.Abby changed gears Youre stressed from school from playing human all day. Go out and run with the pack and work off those frustrations. Ill call the school and let them know youre taking a few mental health days.Clarke smirked and stood up pulled off the last of her clothes which still smelled like Lexa.Her bones gave a few loud cracks as she started shifting painlessly into her wolf form into a wolf that might be made mistaken for any normal wolf were it not for the larger size the unusual color and the cleverness behind the eyes.When Clarke was on all fours she yipped at her mom.Abby chuckled You go ahead Honey. Ill see you at dinner and she watched as the flash of golden fur bounded out the back door.Then she picked up her phone and made a call.Hey Gus yeah Id say theyve got a 60 shot maybe 70. Its still early though. Hows Lexa doing in her classes When she could feel Lexas next rut approaching in November Clarke was ready.She was done with taking sick days just because Lexa was in rut. Lexas biology was Lexas fucking problem not hers. And at this rate shed run out of sick days long before the school year ended.So Clarke decided to bite the bullet.Shed found a company that made discreet nose plugs for workers with stinky jobs. And Clarke had bought a lot of them.And they did help some. But even with the little pieces of clear plastic shoved up her nostrils Clarke could still smell Lexas seductive scent calling to her in their classes.She tried her damnedest not to let it get to her though. And the weird sensation of having plastic shoved up her nose gave her something else to focus on other than thoughts of Lexa and the wetness pooling between her thighs.She still had to white knuckle it through all of her classes that day but it wasnt bad enough that she had to go to the nurses office and make up an excuse to be sent home which felt like a win.And then two major setbacks happened ... Setback 1 The first setback happened after class at cheerleading practice.The soccer team wasnt practicing on the field that day and Clarke felt relatively safe in the outside air. She also didnt want to risk the embarrassment of having a piece of plastic fly out of her nose during one of their cheerleading stunts so Clarke had taken out her nose plugs.And when the coach sent her to look for one of the cheerleaders who had never come back from her water break Clarke thought nothing of it.She picked up the girls trail immediately and waked off the field toward the bleachers.It was only when she walked to the back of the bleachers that Lexas scent hit her. Cinnamon and cedar musk and strength. And sex. Lexa reeked of sex and oh god Lexas rut It smelled so fucking good.And in that moment Clarke was certain her implant had malfunctioned.She knew she should turn around immediately and run back to practice.But her legs were already running toward Lexas scent fire coursing through her veins a deep ache throbbing between her thighs.She ran past the closed concession stand building to the womens bathroom. Even through the door Clarke could hear someone desperately moaning out Lexas name and just the sound made everything in her shiver.She shoved open the door and saw Costia sitting on the counter leaned way back against the mirror Lexas head under the skirt of her cheerleading uniform.Costia cast a glance at her but she kept urging Lexa on as if Clarke wasnt even there.Lexa Clarke half shouted stepping into the bathroom and folding her arms to hide her painfully hard nipples.The movement under Costias skirt stopped.Lexa leaned back and stood up to her full height.Well hello Clarke Lexa said with a wolfish grin her green eyes sparkling Did you need somethingCostia has practice Clarke growled.Oh I dont think she needs any practice Lexa grinned back Shes a natural.Yeah Costia panted Im good here.Youre not Clarke stepped forward unable to stop herself from taking in a deep breath of Lexas scent. Clarke could feel Lexas pheromones sliding across her skin could feel her already destroyed underwear clinging between her thighs.Coach will cut you for this shit Clarke snapped at Costia but she couldnt stop looking at Lexa. At the strong curves of her shoulders under her black Pink Floyd tshirt at the way Lexas green eyes were fixed on her.Clarkes tongue ran over her canines which had already extended into fangs in her mouth and she had no doubt that her normally blue eyes had shifted to violet now too. The wolf in her was howling for her to just pounce on Lexa to feel Lexa pressed against her to taste Lexas mouth.But Clarke was pulling way down deep on all her self control to keep herself together. Was relying on the qualities shed been honing her entire life and that she would one day use as pack leader.Then she heard the sharp sound of one of her bones cracking.Oh fuck Clarke thought Im shifting If Clarkes human form wasnt going to get closer to Lexa then apparently her omega had decided to just shift into wolf mode and do it for her.Lexa caught her panicked expression and turned to Costia who was still leaned back against the mirror panting.You should get going Lexa said sweetly patting Costias knee.Costia wrinkled her forehead But I know Lexa grinned at her.Another loud crack came from Clarkes body and this time the sound was loud enough to catch Costias attention.Costias eyes darted to Clarke but Lexa patted her knee again to pull her attention away.We can pick this up later Lexa said in a seductive growl that sent a shiver down Clarkes spine.Costia grinned at Lexa and then slid off the counter and walked straight out the door.And suddenly the two of them were very alone.Clarke heard another loud crack from her body. She was sweating from how hard it was to resist her bodys urge to shift to resist the urge to just pounce on Lexa and feel Lexas body pressed against hers. They were entirely too far away from each other.She couldnt risk shifting at school.Fuck.Clarke compromised and took quick steps toward Lexa until she was just a step away and being that close to her made Clarkes body relax a little made the wolf in her back down a bit.You cant keep pulling this shit Clarke growled Youre attracting way too much attention.Lexa rolled her eyes.Clarke poked her in the chest Do you know how many senior girls have come out as queer since you started school here The LGBT club has gotten fucking massive thanks to you. Parents are starting to freak out. Do you know what people are saying Clarke only waited a beat for an answer Theyre saying the L is for you. Theyre calling it the Lexa club.Lexa smirked.But even as she said it Clarkes head was spinning from the smell of Lexas rut from the idea that she could just push forward at any second and join the Lexa club herself. God Lexa smelled good She could practically taste Lexa when they were standing this close.Unlike you attracting attention to yourself Lexa folded her arms Debate team captain elected to student government in a landslide cocaptain of the cheerleading squad your first and only year here Youre not exactly keeping a low profile. And cheerleading Clarke ReallyHow do you think I got elected Clarke growled back Make no mistake I rule this school but I needed allies to do it There has got to be a better way Lexas golden eyes locked with hers Cheerleading is beneath you.Clarke tried to hold herself steady at the compliment. God she wanted to find out what Lexa tasted like. Her brain was chanting Lexa Lexa Lexa very loudly now.You want to lead by suffering fools Lexa tipped up her chin Thats your strategyIts called being loved. Read some Machiavelli Clarke shot back surprising herself at her ability to pull that little retort out from one of the readings Abby had assigned her.Lexas eyebrows raised for a moment. But then her eyes narrowed The Prince was meant to be satirical.And maybe Clarke was imagining it but it seemed like Lexa was leaning in a little closer too was maybe trying to catch her scentWhether its satire or political philosophy is debated Clarke whispered But its true that leaders who dont want to rule through fear need to build alliances through love through shared goals and understanding and yes sometimes by having the patience to suffer fools.Maybe thats what Im doing Lexa shrugged building alliances with love.Oh please Clarke rolled her eyes Youre being reckless with all your fucking around how are you hiding your Clarke gestured to Lexas crotch knowing full well that female alphas have a clitoris that extends to the length and width of a penis when theyre aroused which would be awfully hard for Lexa to explain to the human girls she was screwing around with without blowing her cover ... so to speak Lexa smiled wolfishly at her Ill tell you a secret Clarke Lexa leaned in and the feeling of Lexas warm breaths on the side of her neck almost made Clarkes knees buckle.The girls at this school Lexa whispered are extremely selfish Clarke couldnt help a little smirk at that but she wasnt going let Lexa distract her Even if they are if youre into them even a little how do you hide your Lexa arched an eyebrow Thats a very personal question And the truth of that statement threw Clarke a little. Maybe Lexa had been tucking it away somehow Maybe when Lexa got hard she took her dick and A shudder wriggled through Clarke at the thought.Lexa smiled wolfishly at her again.Ill tell you a second secret Lexa said her golden eyes landing on Clarkes lips but you have to give me your oath you wont tell anyone.You have it Clarke breathed giving away her solemn oath as if it was nothing as she studied Lexas lips right back.Lexa leaned over to her other ear and whispered I have an implant. It helps me focus. Stops my body from changing during sex makes my pheromones undetectable.Clarke leaned back and scoffed You dont. Youve been tormenting me with your scent for months. And they dont make implants for alphas.Lexa raised an eyebrow I assure you I do have an implant. Im part of a clinical trial. Im one of the very first alphas to get it.Clarke shook her head Then its not working. I can smell you everywhere feel you especially when youre in rut.Lexas eyebrow quirked an utterly perplexed look on her face It is working Clarke. When we found out you were coming to school here too I got the implant so we wouldnt have any effect on each other. I have regular checkups to monitor the side effects and make sure its working Clarke bristled Im telling you Its not working.Lexas forehead furrowed It is. I dont have a scent at all. My parents got me an apartment near school so I dont have to be around the rest of my pack while I dont have a scent so my clan doesnt think Im weak.Clarke shoved Lexa back a step Youre lying. I can feel you Lexa.Lexa stood up straighter Im not lying. My parents come over for dinner every weekend and they cant smell me.Why would you lie about this Clarke said shoving Lexas back to the wall Just to mess with me Is that what this is Is that the kind of leader youre going to beLexa shoved forward at that and in a flash it was Clarkes back against the wall.I give you my oath Clarke Lexa growled Whatever youre feeling its not my pheromones. Its impossible. And you have an implant too right How could you possibly feel me through thatHmmm .From somewhere deep in Clarkes sex muddled brain she started to wonder How was it possible for Lexa to provoke such a strong reaction in her despite her implant Maybe it hadnt been Lexas pheromones affecting her all this time Maybe she was just kind of infatuated with Lexa And now shed just told her that Clarke could feel the cold chill of mortification settling into her bones.No.She wasnt going to just take Lexas word over what she could smell with her own nose what she felt with her own body what she could taste floating in the air between them when Lexa was standing so close like now.Lexa must be doing something to make her implant stop working. Must be lying about having an implant herself .I cant believe you would break your sacred oath Clarke growled In my clan breaking your oath is a serious crime.Lexa gave a curt nod In my clan as well.Clarkes eyes narrowed I was hoping our clans could work together someday but clearly you cant be trusted.Lexa stood up a little straighter Test me.Clarkes forehead furrowed What do you mean How can I test youLexa lifted her chin Kiss me.Clarke laughed Is that what all this is about All this just to get me to kiss youOh please Lexa scoffed Ive kissed loads of people. And Im sure you have too. If youre going to challenge my honor question our ability to form alliances as leaders of our clans then you better be damn sure youre right about this.Ok fine Clarke spat back But how can I tell from a kiss Are we going off what I smell Because I can smell you right now.Lexa shook her head You obviously have a brain tumor or something if youre smelling things that arent there. Look. Heres my proposal. Kiss me. But give me the kind of kiss an alpha couldnt help but react to. You can feel the evidence on me. Ill show you if you prefer.Fine Clarke half shouted.She grabbed the front of Lexas shirt and spun them around shoved Lexas back to the wall pressing her chest against Lexas and dove in giving Lexa a bruising kiss and Clarke felt her whole body ignite.Oh fuck. Lexa tasted amazing.The feeling of Lexa pressed against her sent a hard shudder through Clarkes bones. Lexas scent filled her lungs and her tongue shoved into Lexas mouth. Her kisses turned hungry deeper devouring Lexas taste and she couldnt help but let out a little moan as Lexas tongue rolled deliciously against hers. Her hand slid down and grabbed Lexas ass her other hand slipped behind Lexas neck pulling her deeper into the kiss. She pressed Lexa harder against the wall her brain spinning at the feeling of Lexas rolling curves pressed against her.She felt Lexas hands land lightly on her waist and Clarkes hand slid down between them and landed squarely between Lexas thighs fully expecting to feel a hard alpha erection against her palm.But the firmness wasnt there.Clarke pulled away from Lexas lips and panted out What her head still spinning from the kiss Are you hiding it somewhereLexa pushed her back a step and started unbuttoning shoved down her pants and Clarke just stared at Lexas completely normal black underwear.No aching alpha bulge anywhere in sight.And Clarke started to feel that cold mortification settling into her bones again.Lexa definitely had some sort of implant if she didnt react to that kiss a kiss that had left her own body shivering with lust.When she reached out her hand all she felt between Lexas thighs was the normal wet cotton that any woman with a pulse would have after a kiss like that.I I dont understand Clarke stammered.What dont you understand Lexa bristled shoving Clarkes hand away and pulling up her pants You called me a liar and you were dead wrong. You can trust me Clarke. Its your credibility thats in question.And with that Lexa stalked out of the bathroom while Clarke just stood there wide eyed. Her heart still beating furiously from the kiss. Setback 2 Although she hated to admit it to herself Clarke recognized that Setback 1 had been a pretty devastating blow.Her whole worldview about Lexa had been shaken.What if Lexa had been telling the truth What if she did have an implant What else could explain why Lexas body hadnt reacted to their kiss Late that night Clarkes lips were still buzzing from the kiss. She could still taste Lexa too.Maybe Lexa had been right maybe something actually was wrong with her Clarke used a few of her sick days to avoid the embarrassment of seeing Lexa in class after what shed done and to buy herself time to figure out what the hell was going on.She couldnt bring herself to tell Abby the details of the massive diplomatic fuckup her crotch had caused. And Lexa had sworn her to secrecy about her implant. So on her first sick day home from school Clarke got up early and begged her mom to take her to the clinic for a very thorough checkup.Abby was a doctor and it was easy enough to do. Clarkes implant passed all the standard maintenance checks and appeared to be working. By her second day off from school Clarkes lab results had come back too. All normal. And the results of the brain scan Clarke had insisted on having to check for tumors had come back normal as well So that eliminated some possibilities.She couldnt find any info in her online research about new implants for alpha werewolves which of course made sense. Werewolves werent exactly advertising their existence. Maybe Lexas implant only stopped her alpha body changes but still left her pheromones detectable to someone with a keen nose Maybe that was why Gustus and Indra couldnt smell Lexa Clarke didnt think she had an especially keen nose compared to the other wolves in her pack. But maybe being an omega gave her super sensitivity to alpha pheromonesShe checked that possibility by nosing around some of the alphas in her pack. But their scents didnt cause anywhere near the reactions in her that Lexas did even when they were in rut.Maybe I only have this sensitivity to certain alphas Clarke thought.Or maybe its just Lexa I have this reaction to Clarke reasoned even more terrifyingly.On her third day home from school Clarke asked her friend Octavia about it when she came over for their patrol run. Maybe other omegas had had this experience You ever meet a wolf who you can like smell everywhere Clarke asked lightly Someone you can feel at full strength even with your implantOctavia just laughed Nah dude. These implants are fucking magic. I was a horny mess before I got mine. They really take the edge off.No one triggers you Clarke asked lightly starting to sweat a little. Maybe she needed a second scan to check for brain tumors ... Octavia just smirked Maybe my perfect match could.Clarkes eyes widened.No.It was beyond ridiculous.Perfect matches were just an old wolves tale They werent real.When Clarke was a cub her dad had once told her a bedtime story about a pair of wolves who were a perfect match mates who were destined to be together mates whose pheromones aligned so perfectly that they were extremely sensitive to one another But Abby had quickly disabused Clarke of that nonsense when shed told her about the story. Abby had explained to her that yes werewolves fell in love but there had never been a documented case of a perfect match in Skykrus entire history. It was just a romantic story.What Octavia eyed her Did you find your perfect match at human high school Your stinky prince or princess charmingClarke just stared back at her.And then her gaze shifted to the floor. She shook her head a little No. Definitely not.It was hard for Clarkes logical brain to even fathom that possibility.But as she lay awake in bed that night she couldnt help but wonder What if its true What if thats the reason I can smell her everywhere can feel her even with my implant If that was the case then Clarke was pretty sure shed made the worst first impression possible on her perfect match by calling her a liar by blaming her for causing Clarkes infatuation with her by challenging the alphas ability to lead her pack and then pushing her into a situation where she had to drop her pants to prove that Clarke was insane. Oof. That possibility was so bad ... She was pretty sure there wasnt any coming back from something like that even if Lexa was her perfect match.A monumental strategic blunder like that did not sit well with Clarke.Maybe she just needed to resign herself to having lost her perfect match and start keeping an eye out for a good enough mate to settle down withBut the idea that she had already revealed so much of her infatuation to Lexa and that Lexa didnt seem to feel it too sent sharp pains of humiliation prickling through her veins.She wanted desperately to even the score between them to prove to Lexa that her inexcusable behavior was a genuine reaction to something real between them.That she wasnt just crazy.If they were a perfect match surely Lexa would have some sort of physical reaction to her too right Even if she did have an amazing implantOn her first day back to school Clarke showed up early for her classes sat as far away from Lexa as possible and didnt dare look at her out of sheer embarrassment over what had happened between them.And when she was certain Lexa would be out on the field for soccer practice she went to the locker room to collect her dirty cheerleading clothes to take home for cleaning.Thats when she saw the door to Lexas locker hanging open.She finished shoving her dirty clothes into her backpack and zipped it shut.Then she casually walked over to the locker and pulled out one of Lexas sweaty soccer jerseys.The smell of Lexas pheromones pouring off it made her mouth water and her crotch ache exquisitely.She smooshed the fabric against her nose gripping it tightly in her fists inhaling Lexas completely intoxicating scent the smell of cinnamon and cedar of musk and strength. God that scent She was soaked Clarke let out a low groan that echoed off the concrete walls of the empty locker room. The command to cover Lexas scent with her own echoed in her mind and a plan started to form in her head.Maybe there was something she could do to make Lexa feel their connection Maybe Lexa just needed more exposure to her scent to feel it a lot more exposure With Lexas jersey in hand she marched directly to one of the bathroom stalls. As soon as she slid the lock into place she turned Lexas jersey inside out shoved down her pants and underwear and pressed Lexas jersey against the dripping wetness between her thighs.She closed her eyes and thought of Lexas face as she rubbed the fabric desperately between her thighs breathing in Lexas scent letting it fill her lungs. She felt her fangs extend heard the sharp crack of one of her bones as she imagined herself running to Lexa as her golden wolf as she thought of seeing Lexas golden eyes sparkling at her for her. She let the hunger for Lexa overtake her completely her hand furiously rubbing the fabric between her thighs gasping and shuddering everything in her rolling and clenching as she tore through one growling climax after another coating the inside of Lexas jersey with the evidence of her desire with the proof that Lexa would be helpless not to react to if there was even the slightest possibility that somewhere under all the interference Lexas implant was causing she had the same feelings for Clarke.The scent of her desire on the jersey would surely trigger Lexa if she was even the slightest bit interested in her.Panting thighs soaked with slick and her job well and truly done Clarke walked out of the bathroom stall on shaky legs walked straight to Lexas locker and put the jersey back inside.But she hesitated there for a long moment.The smell of their two scents mixed together on the jersey called to her. Made her want to shove the jersey into her backpack and run home with it. Made her want to lay in bed for hours with it pressed against her face. Made her want to rub it all over herself until she was covered in their mixed scents eternally.It took everything in Clarke to slam Lexas locker shut and spin the combination lock so she couldnt. And even then the wolf in her was howling for her to shift to rip the metal locker open and take her prize.Clarke allowed herself one last deep breath of their scents her head leaning against the locker her fingers gripping the metal lattice cage that kept her from it.And then she let out a deep sigh spun around and ran out of the locker room grabbing her backpack as she bolted past it and out the door. The next day Clarke arrived ridiculously early to her first class. She took her normal seat third row center. Heart racing. Sweating. Staring at the open door of the classroom waiting for Lexa to show up. Waiting to see the look on Lexas face when they saw each other which Clarke was absolutely certain would tell her whether Lexa had had the same reaction to her scent that shed been having to Lexas all this time.The sound of her heartbeat thudding in her chest counted down the painful seconds to learning the truth that she was dying to know. Was Lexa her perfect match Was she just a complete lunatic who had destroyed a strangers jersey in the most inappropriate way possible Every muscle in her body was bristling with tension. Cold sweat prickled across her skin.And there were still 10 minutes left before class started.Are you ok ClarkeThe sound of her teachers voice made Clarke jolt in her seat.You seem on edge the teacher said eyeing her carefully her pen frozen over the paper she was grading.Im good Im good Clarke lied her attention snapping back to the open classroom door.But Lexa never appeared.Clarke didnt hear a single thing that happened in class. She didnt raise her hand once. Couldnt answer any of the questions she was asked. And she couldnt stop glancing at the door every few seconds either.Clarke rushed to her next class and did the same thing. Stared at the door heart racing muscles tense.But Lexa didnt show.When the bell rang at the end of their last class yet another class Lexa hadnt shown up to Clarke was gutted. Was Lexa her perfect match Was her crush onesided Was Lexa so pissed at her after their argument that Clarke had lost her perfect match for good Had she blown it If she could just talk to her ... Clarke needed answers. Today. Now. She didnt think she could survive one more hour without knowing.She hurried to her locker shoved her backpack inside and slammed the door shut. She ran deep into the woods behind the school checked that she couldnt smell or hear anyone pulled off her clothes and shifted bones cracking heart racing.Her golden fur shining in the late afternoon light she let out the most pitiful howl she had ever heard and then she flew through the woods in the direction of home the pads of her paws pushing hard off the ground leaping forward with every step to get where she needed to go for some answers her heart pounding as each heaving breath tore through her chest.When she got home after her long run she crashed through the back door of the house and shifted her naked human form covered in dirt her chest heaving as Abby stared at her mouth hanging open.What Abby started.Call them Clarke barked out through panting breaths Call Lexas parents she wasnt in class I need to know where she is her apartment and then Clarke felt a sob burst free in her chest.Setback 1 Clarkes utter humiliation from revealing her infatuation had been a devastating blow.But this The not knowing if Lexa felt it too Not knowing if she had lost her perfect match for good after their argument It was infinitely worse.Abby was still staring at Clarke who was now on her knees crying.Call them Clarke shouted.Some part of Clarke registered that she was freaking Abby out. She could smell the sharp tang of fear pouring off her mom as the sounds of her own sobbing filled her ears.Clarke tried to reach down deep for the composure she had been cultivating her whole life but she couldnt find it. It was like it never existed.She reached down even deeper within herself and what she came up with was the memory of Lexas scent mixed with her own and a feeling of calm a feeling of home washed over her. Her breathing started to even out her sobs started to slow Please Clarke practically whispered voice shaky her blue eyes glistening with tears I have to know.Abby seemed to come out of her shock all at once. She grabbed her phone and stood up walked to the other room.Clarke let out a deep breath leaned forward on her knees her forehead on the carpet as she remembered the smell of her scent mixed with Lexas and let the feeling of calm flood through her at the memory.After who even knew how long her breaths evened out. She could feel some semblance of control taking hold. She sat up sniffling a little still thinking about the smell of cinnamon and cedar of musk and strength imagining that warm scent filling her lungs her heart.When Abby came back into the room Clarkes gaze snapped to her.Abby sat down next to her on the floor put her hand gently on Clarkes knee and Clarke felt the warmth of it felt the wave of calming pheromones her mom was giving off They wouldnt tell me much but shes been pulled out of school. Gustus and Indra sent her to a military academy. They say she needs more structure.What Clarke breathed a fresh wave of tears filling her eyes No.Her eyes slid shut. She felt big tears sliding down her cheeks. She was far too exhausted for sobbing now. What she felt now wasnt the heat of desperation. What she felt now was cold. Bitter. Emptiness.Mom shes I Clarke looked at her big sloppy tears still rolling down her cheeks.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/48375862,Hold Me Down || Clexa Re-Write,The clans are restless in the throne room after learning of another Skaikru attack on a defenseless village. They demand vengeance from their commander and when she refused instead calling for a blockade of Arkadia a few men lunged at her small blades flashing from their belts before Titus and her guards intercede and swiftly put them down in bloody fashion. A short while Later Clarke enters Lexas room to find her sitting on the floor against her bed legs crossed eyes closed. Someone tried to kill you today how are you this calm Lexa takes a few more deep breaths before opening her eyes youre angry about the kill order...Yes.... Says Clarke.Lexa looks softly up at Clarke to meet her eyes seeing the same frustration and helplessness that she herself is struggling to swallow How else would you have me enforce a blockadeClarke shakes her head looking around at Lexas room dozens of candles gently flicker their shadows dancing along the walls. Her eyes settle on the sofa where she watched Lexa fall asleep just the other day as she watched over her sketchbook on her lap memorizing every curve of the commander as her fingers moved charcoal over paper. Things finally felt like they were falling into place. How could so much have changed in a matter of daysSo when do we leave She asked.Lexa stands up meets Clarkes eyes and cannot bring herself to answer right away. She bites her lips together and holds her hands behind her back hoping Clarke wont notice them shaking.We may be drawing a line but whos to say you cant choose to stay on this side of it her voice waivers trying to get the words out.... Not wanting to sound desperate but hoping Clarke can sense how much she wants her to stay.I know someone who might... Clarke says with a quick smirk as a voice is getting louder down the hall. Lexa smiles and meets the blue eyes before both nervously look down like schoolchildren who know they are about to get detention.The muffled voice getting louder is Titus as he storms down the hall towards the room yelling in Trig at the guards outside the door I told you she was NOT to be disturbed His orders had been meant for this exact reason knowing only Clarke could affect Lexa going through with the blockade.He barges into the room immediately sensing the tension and looks between the two girls both still looking down. Wanheda the blockade goes into effect at Dawn Ive arranged one of our fastest horses for you to take. He gestures at the door wanting Clarke to take her leave without further delay.Actually Lexa interjects Ive asked Clarke to stay in Polis as my guest. The girls eyes flick and meet for a split second at the word guest and Lexa sees Clarke have to look away so Titus wont see her grinning again. She knows exactly how Titus will respond but she isnt letting her go again like she did at the mountain. Not by her choice at least.Titus locks eyes with Lexa anger building in his eyes Clarke will you excuse us. He says sternly without breaking eye contact with Lexa.Clarke swiftly nods and backs out of the room but lingers just outside a few paces from the door. She too knows exactly what Titus is about to say on the other side of the door but she fears if she goes back to Octavia now shell be ushered on her way to Arkadia and isnt ready to leave just yet not like this.Inside the room Titus lowers his voice and steps towards Lexa who has turned and walked away towards the window Heda on this sacred day I beg you to remember my teachings. he pauses as she turns around to face him jaw clenched as she holds her composure. Love is weakness to be commander is to be alone.I will not hear this again She snarles walking past him towards the door. All she can think about is reaching Clarke before its too late. She only makes it a couple steps before Titus strong hand rips her backwards his voice now agitated as he scolds Yes you WILL Your feelings for Clarke put BOTH of you in danger if you care for her you must send her home that is the ONLY way she will be safe Dont make her pay the price for your mistake as Costia did.Hearing Costias name thrown in her face ignited her insides. Her composure was already cracking and with that last sentence it snapped completely.MY MISTAKES Lexa explodes shaking Tituss hand from her arm.... She feels her vision blurring as the rage crescendos in her chest. Azgeda CUT OFF Costia head and DELIVERED it to my BED and still I LET them into my alliance. I AM MORE THAN FUCKING CAPABLE OF SPARATING FEELINGS FROM DUTYOutside the door Clarke realized she had been holding her breath and slowly exhales as goosebumps inch up her arms and prick up the hairs on base of her neck. Hearing the emotion spill out of Lexa was heartbreaking. Clarke knows how hard she works to keep it all together to bury emotions to remain stoic and sure especially as more and more whispers are circulating among the ambassadors questioning her resolve. Clarke looks at one of the two guards who subtly shakes his head in sympathy a gesture to show support but also confirming he cant let her back in right now.Lexa flops down on her couch her head in her hands as she steadies her breathing but her thoughts continue to race. How do I go back to life before her What if I cant protect her What is the point of it all thenLexa.... Titus utters resting a hand on her shoulder. In that moment he looks down at the girl hes help raise since she was a toddler with sympathy forced into the brutality of natblida training and saddled with the weight of responsibilities far beyond her age. Hes seen the light drained from her eyes over the years hardened by the expectations the fear of failure and the loss of her first love. Over countless hours of lessons he stressed staying calm and confident putting her role as leader first. Most importantly that love or any attachment is weakness. He knows the toll its taken on her over so many years. She is a symbol an emblem of hope to her people. But right now all he sees is the little girl he knew.I dont think I can do this again. Her voice cracks slightly as she gasps to catch the quiver in her chest holding it in her lungs as tears start to flow again I tried...I tried so hard not to fall for her. I really did. She buries her face into her palms slowly hyperventilating.I know Heda. Titus says.I just need her to know. At least once. I cant control what she does I know she needs to be with her people but I cant let her go again without her knowing. I should have never walked away from that mountain. I should have fought for her and for her people if I did we wouldnt be here right now.Heda forgive me I know it was not easy but it was the right thing to do. The clans were ready to turn on you. Nia had most of them behind her cause and she was ready to use the losses from war with the Mountain as her final rallying cry. Youre lucky she chose a formal challenge rather than sending her assassins.Maybe I should have chosen a fighter instead against Roan. Lexa mumbles under her breath.You know anyone else would have been killed and gave way for Ontari to get the flame.What if I dont WANT the flame anymore Her head snaps up at Titus I brought the 12 clans together if they are all supporting Nia then let her carry the burden of keeping them altogether. For a second she thinks about what that would have meant had they removed the flame after Roan defeated her champion. It had never happened before. Any past commander that was challenged fought for themselves so they either won or were killed. She wonders if her people would have just let her leave Polis to wander the woods in her new life free.She closes her eyes back into her hands and briefly pictures a cabin along the river surrounded by fields of flowers. As she walks up to it the door opens and Clarke leans her blonde mane against the frame smiling beckoning her inside. Its so quiet and calm and just the two of them. Lexa imagines herself running to her scooping her up into the crisp wet air and burrowing her face into Clarkes chest as she squeezes tighter and tighter....But the blood drains from her face at Titus wordsYou know who they would come for first.,Explicit,Commander Lexa (The 100)Heda Lexa (The 100)Wanheda Clarke GriffinPost-Episode AU: s03e07 Thirteen (The 100)SexRomanceFluff and SmutGratuitous SmutBlood and GoreOther Additional Tags to Be Added
https://archiveofourown.org/works/48733810,Down To Earth (A 100 Fanfiction),The door slid open and the woman peered out to see a young boy with chestnut locks and bright blue eyes standing in front of her.Roman noticed that she had been crying for her eyes were red and swollen. Slipping his hands in the pockets of his worn jeans he greeted her.Hello Aunt Abby. He said awkwardly. He had never really spoken to the chief doctor by himself before he was usually with Clarke whenever he spoke to her.Oh hello Roman Abby said regaining her composure and wiping her eyes. Her voice was very hoarse and shaking. Roman wondered what happened for her to be in such a state did she get into a fight with her husband Jake or Clarke. What are you doing hereI was just wondering if Clarke was here Roman responded looking down at the ground. She said that she wanted to talk to me about something it was about school.Okay that last part was a lie. Clarke told him to come for another reason. It was very important. She also told him not to tell anyone about it this was a secret between him Wells and her.Abby tried to hide a sob by covering her mouth but Roman noticed. He pretended he didnt because he didnt want to upset her even more.Clarkes not feeling well she said that no one must disturb her Abby mumbled as if she herself was trying to believe her own words. Does your father know youre hereRoman raised his eyebrows in surprise. Abby never really cared about his father or his friendship with Clarke. Why would she care nowI thought Id just talk to Clarke and get back before he comes home.Abby nodded solemnly. She lifted her hand as if to try and stroke Romans cheek but she recoiled and recollected herself. He wasnt fazed by this she had done this many times when he came over. It was probably her stopping herself from treating him as if she was his mother. But Roman didnt mind if she did it the Griffin Family were like his second family. You should go home then.But Ill tell Clarke that you dropped by. Im sure your father will be home soon.Roman wanted to say more but it was clear that Clarkes mother was uncomfortable. He didnt want to annoy her with his questions. He could always just talk to Clarke tomorrow.Okay send my regards to her. Goodbye Aunt Abby. Roman tried smiling turning around. The moment his back was facing her he heard the door slide shut after him.Something was wrong Abby was clearly upset by something. And Roman guessed that it had something to do with Clarke.Roman began walking back to his familys quarters deep in thought.He wondered what happened. To be honest he had noticed slight changes in Clarkes behavior over the past few weeks. She was quieter than normal he knew because he was the quietest out of their friend group consisting of himself Wells the Chancellors son and her. But recently she had been quieter than even him. He would have to talk about it with Wells he might know whats going on or how to fix it.Roman was so lost in thought that he nearly bumped into the door of his quarters. He jumped back in shock. He didnt realize that his home was that close to Clarkes.Why am I friends with such a klutz That sounded like something Clarke would say. She and Wells always made jokes about how clumsy Roman could be sometimes. He didnt do it on purpose it just happened when he was focused or in deep thought that he would accidentally trip or bump into something which was very often.He punched in the code to enter his house on the keypad. The door opened and he made his way in only to stop in his tracks.His father was sitting on the couch looking at something on his tablet. He looked up and made eye contact with his son. Roman stood awkwardly his back straight and his arms glued to his sides.Hey Dad. Roman finally managed to say moving his gaze to the ground.Roman. His father greeted him placing his tablet on the table and sitting back on the couch.Youre home early Roman said noticing his untied shoelace. That explains why he nearly fell on the way to Clarkes.We finished a lot earlier than we planned. His father replied his voice monotonous. Since youre here take a seat. Theres something I have to tell you.Roman shuffled his way towards the couch and sat down next to his father leaving a small distance between the two of them.What do you want to tell me Roman asked reaching towards his untied shoelaces to tie them.There was silence. Roman could hear his heart beating. He didnt know what was going to happen. Was he in trouble Did he mess up Was his father going to yell at him ... againJake Griffin was floated today. His father finally said.Romans head shot up and he looked at his father in horror. What HowHis best friends father was killed. That explains why Abby was crying.He was arrested for attempting to disclose information about the Ark. His daughter knew about it as well shes been placed in solitary confinement.Roman sprung up from the couch. That cant be true Clarke and Uncle Jake would never do anything to harm the Ark I know them I know ClarkeWe all thought that But the Council voted and the majority won. Jake was executed and Clarke was arrested.You didnt vote against them did you Dad Roman asked no he was practically praying that his father didnt vote against them.His father looked away from him Romans heart sank. How could he look Clarke in the eye again if he ever did see her again if his father was one of the people who voted for her father to be killed and sentenced her to her own death.How ... how could you Romans voice was hoarse. She ... she is my friend She isnt even eighteen yet You took her life away from her.Im truly sorry Roman. I know how close you and Clarke were. But we have to uphold the law of the Ark. I was just doing whats best for our people No Roman yelled at his father. You were just doing whats best for yourself You knew that if you voted youd gain peoples favor and theyd vote for you as Chancellor Was being ViceChancellor not good enough for youRomans father stared at him in disbelief. Roman could see the anger boiling in his eyes but he was too angry himself to even care.Roman Kane. His voice was dangerously soft. Dont you dare speak to me like that Why cant you be more obedient like Wells.What has any of this got to do with WellsHis father stood up placing his hands on his hips and looking down at his young son.Wells was the one who told Chancellor Jaha about the situation he answered. He is loyal to the Ark.Roman couldnt believe this. Not only had the man he considered an uncle been killed and one of his two most trusted friends had been arrested but his other friend had also been the one to sell them out.When he woke up that day he just wanted to survive the day without screwing up not to have his entire lifestyle changed.He felt a hand on his shoulder. As if on instinct he slapped his fathers hand away and glowered at him. His father knew how much Clarke meant to him and how much he wanted to follow in Jake Griffins footsteps. And he still voted to have them killed all because of that stupid law.Just when I think you cant ruin my life more than you have already. He growled stepping away from the larger man. Now I understand why my Mom wanted nothing to do with you.Roman didnt even care that he mentioned his mother in front of his father. His father may have not directly pulled the lever that killed Clarkes father or locked Clarke away himself but he allowed it to happen.There was a sudden ding coming from the door someone was outside. Roman spun on his heel and stormed up to the door and pressed the button that opened the door.He clenched his jaw when he saw Wells standing outside looking at him anxiously. He looked like he had been running.Roman thank god Wells gasped trying to catch his breath. Listen theres something I need to tell you about Clarke Roman didnt give him the chance to finish as his fist connected with Wells face. The other boy fell to the ground with a thud. Roman couldnt believe he had punched someone in the face he usually just hid behind Wells and Clarke in their group and only spoke when he wanted to. He didnt want to draw attention to himself being the son of Marcus Kane the ViceChancellor of the Ark.Roman He heard his father yell behind him. Roman shrugged him off.I thought you cared about Clarke He screamed at Wells who sat up staring at him in shock. His nose was oozing so much blood that Roman almost felt sorry for punching him but now was not the time to feel remorse. She was our best friend Weve known her since we were small And Uncle Jake was nothing but good to you This is how you repay themRoman let me explain. Wells pleaded but he shut his mouth when Roman raised his hand to stop him.Theres nothing to explain You chose the Ark over people who care for you Roman yelled at the top of his lungs. I want you to leave my home and never come back I dont want you anywhere near meRoman pressed the button and the door slid closed with Wells still outside. He turned to his father standing there with his arms crossed and a disappointed look on his face. Roman held his head high and stormed past him purposefully slamming his shoulder into him.Dont bother calling me for dinner. He snapped coldly making his way to his room.After the door closed behind him Roman stumbled to the bay window looking out into the vastness of space. Sitting on the ledge he leaned his head against the cold glass examining the vast darkness of space with small specks of light flickering in the distance.Finally Roman found a small tear falling down his cheek. He lifted his hand and wiped it away.He didnt know how to feel. He knew that he hated his father and Wells that was for sure. He was obviously upset that his Uncle Jake was dead and Clarke was arrested. He was angry at the Council for making that horrible decision.He had known Clarke ever since they were seven years old he met Wells later when their fathers became Chancellor and ViceChancellor. Jake Griffin had agreed to take him under his wing and help him become an engineer. Thats what he and his friends had planned. Wells was going to join the guard Clarke was going to become a doctor and he was going to become an engineer. They were going to make the Ark a better place and change those stupid rules maybe even help with the return to Earth.And now all those plans were gone.There had to be a reason that they were arrested. Roman was going to find out what that was. He was going to get Clarke out hopefully before her eighteenth birthday. He wasnt going to let Wells or his father or the Council stop him. He was going to save her. This is my first fanfiction so please be gentle I really enjoyed the 100 even though season 7 wasnt my favorite. I thought it would be nice to write this story in my own way while also adding my own character. And I thought Id make him Kanes son because I thought it would be nice. I hope you enjoyed this chapter. In the next chapter Roman is going to have an encounter with another character from the 100 my personal favorite I think you might figure out who it is.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/50124406,Voices from the stone,Six years. It had been six years since her grandfather had died. Clarke hadnt been particularly close with her grandfather Joseph Griffin but she had felt sad when he had died when Clarke was five years old. Still it wasnt like when her father Jake had died a year ago. She had adored her father. Worshipped him. Loved him more than anyone. She loved her mama but she would never be able to love her mama the way she loved her daddy. She knew that that was probably a mean thing to think. But it was the truth.Clarke wondered if her mother resented her for that. But she hoped not.Clarke Eliza Griffin age ten had barely any other family save for her mother Abby Griffin.Her grandmother had died two years before she was born she had never met her mothers parents and her grandfather had died of a heart attack when Clarke had been five and her daddy had died of a shooting when Clarke had been ten.Clarke knew that her mother was dating not long after her daddy had died. The man that her mama was dating a man named Marcus Kane wasnt a cruel man or anything from what Clarke could see. But it hurt. It really hurt that her mama was moving on so soon after Clarkes daddy Jake Griffin had died.Clarke had nightmares almost every night of the way in which he had died.Clarke and Abby had not been there when Jake had been shot through the head. Clarkes daddy had gone out for a business trip and had been shot in his office. There was no footage of who had done it. Clarkes daddys office was out of the range of the camera so no one was recorded having shot him. And there were no witnesses.But Clarke of course hated whoever had murdered her daddy. Whoever had taken him from her.She had paid almost obsessive attention to the news for the past year hoping to hear anything about anything found about the murderer of her daddy. But no news local or otherwise sounded even close to what she was looking for.Murder you wouldnt think that that was something that happened often in Manchester New Hampshire. And it wasnt. But it happened.Murder wasnt common in a lot of cities in New Hampshire. Didnt mean that they didnt occur.When Clarke age nine at the time had heard that her daddy had been shot from the police She had been numb. Then angry. She had wanted to scream at that officer for spouting what she thought at the time was a lie. Or at least that was what she told herself it was. Then she had screamed and cried and sobbed.It hurt. It hurt too much.And the more it hurt The more she hated the person that had shot her daddy.Soon Her mama had moved with Clarke closer to a more rural area in Manchester.They now lived in a house close to an area near the water but near a forest too.It was nice there Clarke admitted. But it stung all the more because she knew that the house they were moving into Was the house that her daddy had picked out when they were planning on moving from the main part of the city. Now the house was occupied by Clarke Abby and Abbys new boyfriend Marcus Kane. Kane was now living where Jake Griffin should have lived.It just made Clarke all the more angry.Which was why she walked to the forest angry bitter upset.She had been there a few times but she went deeper into the forest this time. Deeper and away from the house where her mother was and where the man that her mother kept expecting her to call dad lived.It was enough to make Clarke want to wretch in anger.Clarke kept moving through the forest wanting to just get away.They had been living here for half a month now. Clarke hoped that her mother wouldnt come looking for her soon.Probably not Clarke thought angrily She probably has Kane to keep herself occupied.The thought just made her go faster past the many trees.Finally she stopped near a large rock which was surrounded by many trees and Clarke paused noticing a few odd marks on the rock.These werent symbols. At least she didnt think so. There were what looked like slash marks all over the rock. Like claw marks or something.Clarke narrowed her eyes.What had caused thatWeird she said wondering uneasily if a bear was nearby but also wondering if a bear even could actually cut into a rock with its claws.She then stiffened up when she heard a voice come from out of nowhere. And she didnt hear itit was in her head.And the voice wasnt her own thoughts.The voice said Whats weird girl is you wandering out here on your own when there are bears and bobcats in the forest. Shouldnt you go back home wherever that is where its safeClarke gasped stepping back several feet. That voicewhere had it come fromShe looked around where she stood. She saw no one. No one but her was here. She shivered. Had she just imagined that voiceShe then shivered when she heard the voice again. It said I have to say we didnt expect you to show up this soon.Clarke gasped.That was a different voice. She knew it because the first voice had sounded like a womans voice. This one sounded like a mans voice.Then another voice came another voice that sounded like a womans. But different from the first womans voice. It said You shouldnt be here little one. At least not without knowing why youre here.Clarke shook her head gasping.The young girl of only ten backed away.She was hearing these voices for real. She was sure of it. And it made her blood run cold.She quickly turned and ran from the group of trees and the rock with the claw marks on it.She gasped for breath as she neared her new house running fast.She felt her heart hammer in her chest. What the hell was thatShe all but cried out as she collided with the wooden steps going up to the front door of her house.She balanced herself then ran up the steps to the front door opening up the door and running inside.She gasped and panted as she got into the residence.She closed the door fast and locked it panting deeply and tiredly shaking. She knew she was out of shape. She was small and thin but she hadnt exercised a lot. She hated going to gym class. Honestly who did besides those boys that liked to make fun of other people and make rude comments about girlsThen again there were those snotty girls that were good at sports and always put other girls outside of their groups down.Either way Clarke disliked both categories.But that was besides the point. The point was there was something in the forest that had spoken to her. And she was positive that she had actually heard those voices. She shivered.Clarke thought for a moment that maybe she had imagined it but no she knew that that wasnt right. And she also thought of the possibility that she might be losing her mind. She heard how kids her age talked about people being crazy. There were all sorts of mean things kids called going crazy.Craycray was one of the more popular terms.Clarke hoped she wasnt but she also didnt think she was. Because she would have had to start have been hearing voices a long time ago rightNo. She wasnt losing her mind.This was something else.As Clarke took a deep breath she nodded sure of what she had decided.She had heard it. Whatever that had been in the forest She had heard it.She cursed quietly. What the hell did she do now She couldnt tell her mom or Kane about it. Her mother wouldnt believe her. That Clarke knew instantly. Her daddy would have believed her. But her mama wouldnt.And Kane From what Clarke had seen of Kane when it came to Clarke trying to get her mama to listen to her about something Kane always took Abbys side. Clarke supposed she understood that. Didnt want to ruin your chances at being with the person you loved right Again she knew that some of the other girls at school and some of the boys had much worse terms than what she was thinking but she decided not to think too much about that.Kids talked about the big S word all the time. But young as Clarke was The tenyearold knew that just because kids talked about sex the subject kids werent supposed to talk about didnt mean that they knew anything about sex at all.She didnt want to think too much about her mom and Kane having sex.And if there was a baby as a result of their relationship Clarke didnt know exactly how babies were made but she knew that sometimes from sex there was a baby. She had no idea why. But she didnt want to think about her mom having a baby with Kane. Or anyone but her daddy.Clarke wondered if she would hate any baby that her mama and Kane had together. She tried not to think like that but she knew there was a possibility that she might.Clarke breathed out more evenly as she looked out the window. She didnt see anyone or anything outside.Stillshe had heard voices right She knew she had.Where had those voices come from Who had been talking to herShe shivered hugging herself.She backed up from the door and turned going down the hall going to her room all the way in the back of the hall.She didnt want to be here anymore. She wanted to be closer to the city and away from that forest that she now felt to behaunted Dangerous Probably both.Clarke didnt even believe in ghosts. She didnt because her daddy hadnt.When Clarke had asked Jake about the forest that theyd be moving close to before his murder shed ask if he believed that the forest had ghosts and she had watched as he paused then had chuckled and said No Clarke honey there arent any ghosts in that forest. Not from what I know.Yes Clarke found what he had said odd even then. But she hadnt asked more.In any case she was glad that she had gotten out of that forest fast. She decided that if she ever went into that forest ever again She would be way more equipped. With flashlights a knife and maybe a large stick.A thought struck her then and Clarke was relieved that it was just her thoughts and her thoughts alone But can you defend yourself against ghosts with a stick a flashlight and a knifeClarke swallowed.Well she knew that answer. No you could not.But they werent going to be leaving this place as far as Clarke knew possibly never.So then what was she supposed to do Never go to the forestShe knew that wasnt an option. Staying out of that forest for the rest of her life would be most likely impossible.What could she doClarke shivered again feeling her heart rate finally begin to slow down. She took a deep breath and made her choice for tomorrow.Tomorrow stupid as the choice was She was going to go back to the forest and listen to those voices.The next day after having tolerated listening to her mother and Kane interact she went back to the forest and stayed there seating herself on a log and waited. She looked around the row of trees and then at the large rock with the claw marks on it and announced loudly as the birds chirped and the insects buzzed Alright Im here. And Im waiting. So out with it if anyone has anything to say.Being only ten Clarke of course wasnt nearly as tough as she sounded.She was only talking tough to get something to happen.And for a time Nothing happened.Then the voices came just when Clarke was prepared to get up off of the log.Or at least one voice did.It was a mans voice.The voice said We see youve returned. Were happy you did.Clarke swallowed and stayed where she was.Who are you She asked.After a few seconds the answer came. This time it was another mans voice that answered.The voice said The answer to that is somewhat difficult to explain. We are friends. Lets put it that way. We want you to be happy. Do you want to be happy ClarkeClarke found this conversation very strange. But she snorted the words out Yeah I do want to be happy. Who doesntGood to know a womans voice said We can help you with that if youd like. We hope you can trust us with that.I think it will be hard to trust random voices that Ive never heard before in my head Clarke said And thats not even talking about the voices that I hear but cant see the people that the voices belong to.Clarke was startled when she heard the sounds that she recognized as chuckles rumbling through her mind.Apparently she had amused the owners of these voices.We understand a mans voice said But try to think about it like this. You can always run away. I assure you we are in a position where we wont be able to come after you. Even if you believe that we might hurt you which we wont you still can run away.Clarke thought about that. She didnt detect deceit in this new voice. But for all she knew Maybe the voices were all lying.About what And why were they lying She didnt have a clue.But she knew that a lot of people could lie. And these voices probably could too.Her elementary school was right next to a middle school and a high school. And there was this boy that went to the high school named Bellamy Blake who she hated and felt disgust in her stomach whenever she saw him. And the elementary school yard the middle school yard and the yard in front of the high school They were right by each other. So Clarke had heard the things that Bellamy would tell the boys with him to do his bidding.The promises he would make them.You didnt have to be an adult to know that the words that spilled out of Bellamys mouth were lies.It was sad though. Those stupid boys that followed Bellamy They didnt realize that Bellamy was lying but Clarke did. But she was younger.She realized it why couldnt theyAnd no she didnt think it was because they were boys and so they were dumber than her. After all her daddy If you had asked her ever who she thought was the smartest person in the world She would say her daddy every time. He was smarter than anyone man or woman. She just figured that the boys that followed Bellamy were particularly stupid teenagers.Youd have to be stupid if you believed a thing that Bellamy Blake said.And it wasnt just stupid teenage boys. Clarke had seen a few teenage girls that loved hanging out with Bellamy. The thing was These girls were always younger than Bellamy.Always. Bellamy was now almost seventeen. The girls that he was with doing things which Clarke couldnt help but assume were those sex things that boys and girls did together were as young as fourteen or even thirteen.The teenagers always went behind the teachers backs and made sure word never got out about an older boy having sex with girls as young as thirteen or fourteen.But a lot of the kids knew.They were just afraid of Bellamy having them beaten up.Clarke had contemplated telling the teachers or even calling the police. But she never did.Not out of fear. But because she had seen the way those younger girls looked at Bellamy.For some reason They wanted him.Clarke had heard her daddy talk about young children involved with adults or even just older kids in that way. He had told her that if any adult approached her and tried to touch her like that or any older kid tried to or anyone tried to touch her inappropriately she was to tell him and her mother immediately.Clarke was just going to guess that none of the girls who Bellamy touched told their parents about what they did with Bellamy.But Clarke got the horrible sense that those girls were with Bellamy because they wanted to be.She didnt understand it and it made her sick just thinking about but if she called the police what would happenShe had a feeling that nothing would happen. The girls and the boys would all do the same thing.Theyd lie for Bellamy.The point was Everyone lied. Everyone. So were these voices any differentClarke cautiously asked Prove it. Show me a way for me to trust all of you. Whoever you are.Alright a womans voice said we can offer you something. A piece of proof. Go to the front yard of your house. And bring a small shovel. Dig under the porch just in front of the house all the way to the right from when you come out of the house. The farthest righthand corner of the house to the right of when you exit the house. Dig there. Youll find something that will be worth your time. Find it and keep it for yourself. Do not let either your mother or Kane know that you have it.Clarke paused thinking about that. What did that meanGo on another mans voice said Go to that spot at the porch and start digging. You will see that were giving you something that will show you that we are on your side. Go on. Im sure you have something like shovels in your house.Its alright girl a new voice a mans voice husky and almost a threatening whisper We know it will help you. Dont show it to your mama. Or to Kane. Keep it for yourself.Clarke furrowed her eyebrows. Yes she had small shovels in her house. They had belonged to her daddys daddy. To Joseph Griffin. He had used them for digging up his potted plants and putting them into new pots. Abby now held onto them but she was considering throwing them out.But Clarke had no idea what could possibly be in this corner of the porch that these voices were talking about.And to keep it from her mother She knew that had to be wrong but knowing that there was something she knew that her mother didnt know her mother with all her lecturing and insults about how stupid and useless Clarke was made Clarke smile.She had no idea what was under the house. Still she might as well find out rightAlright she said Ill go and dig up whatever that thing is on the righthand corner of the houses porch. I dont know what this is about. But Ill do it. She got up from the log and began walking away from the enclosure. She said Youll still be here when I finish doing thatClarke wasnt sure why she felt so hopeful at the thought of the source of the voices whatever that source may be might still be present when she came back. Curiosity probably.Clarke tried not to feel somewhat relieved when she heard one of the womens voices say Yes Clarke well be here when you finish. Well be right here.Clarke nodded and walked back in the direction of her house. She was going to go to the basement of the house get a small shovel then while her mother and Kane were out in the backyard having a drink whatever that meant and dig up the space that the voices were talking about under the righthand corner of the porch in the front yard.Shed see what this was all about.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/33214573,The Gamble,Omegaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. She could hear their snickers.Lexa cussed. What a royal fucking fumble. Games against Azgeda were always like this a call to war. They always knew how to get under her skin. Her teammate Robbins pulled her to her feet. The oppositions alpha captain grinned at her. You need some company tonight They all laughed. The Azgeda striker another fullofherself alpha kissed the air.Hey. Shake it off. A hard clap on her shoulder and she was staring into Anyas familiar eyes. They bumped foreheads and Lexa nodded into it pulling in a deep breath. You got this. Lets show em.She nodded back as Anya turned away. She could still hear them laughing. Shed had enough. Thompson The blonde turned to her. Lexa made sure to turn her back to the other team circling her fingers around each other. Theyd switch out places giving her center field with the alpha captain.Aces They were spreading apart again falling back into position. Fake me.Are you sure It was a risky play. They were running out of time and they should be pushing the box for a shot. I got something to say to her. Aces nodded. Her sister was returning to the opposite side of the field mirror position to her own. They caught eyes for an instant and she smirked predatory and full of teeth.The play started. The ball was on Anyas side Aces running it. The Azgeda alpha drove straight through to center field and Lexa surged forward to meet her staying inside of her as Aces juggled to pass it to her.The alpha backstepped then faked trying to get inside of Lexa but she was ready one step ahead and quicker on her feet. She sidechecked Aces had reangled and was setting up to send the ball to her actual target Anya waiting wideopen downfield. The alpha was hot on her neck and growled in her ear exactly where Lexa wanted her and oblivious to the ball rapidly approaching their net. Lexa sidestepped faking an opening and the Alpha rushed her greedily. Lexa was expecting it. She readjusted dropping her posture and grounding herself shoulderchecking her roughly. A whistle the play was over. The alpha hit the dirt like a rock. A snarl curled onto her lips as she started to pick herself up but Lexa jutted her chin defiantly down at her. That answer your questionShe backpedalled with a smile. The striker Alpha took a heady step towards her but Anya was there in an instant in the girls space and pushing her back. The girl snarled. Anya pointed warningly. Kicks the absolute instigator barked. Take it home WoodsAces called to her. You need a clearI can lose her. Just give me the shot.Aces grinned. You got it Commander.The whistle sounded and the Alpha was in her space again. She tried to use her bigger frame but Lexa faked clearing her. Kicks was pushing into the goal and the goalie was surging forward to meet her. She could feel the Alpha against her a thick presence against her back but she backstepped throwing the brunette off balance and pivoted. The surprise was clear as she hit the ground and Lexa was free of her. Kicks sent her the ball high and center. Someone was charging into her left but she turned her back to them pivoting off her offfoot and throwing everything she had into a kick. It connected perfectly and for a moment the world was silent as she watched it sail through the air the world silent around her.The ball sailed into the net free and clear. The world exploded around her as the ground rushed to meet her and the sound of the crowd was roaring in her ears. She was on her feet instantly whooping into the air and she was surrounded by the scents of her teammates as they collided into her in celebration. The alpha was giving her a death glare but she jutted her chin with a smile. The tide had turned.Breaking away from the chaos of aftergame celebrations Lexa headed to the sidebenches extricating her water bottle from her gym bag and emptying it thirstily.That was an amazing play. You dont usually go so aggressive. Lexa blinked casting her eyes to the bleachers above her. The blonde was a beauty soft features framed by golden locks that fell around her shoulders. She leaned against the railing looming over the soccer player directly regarding her with bright eyes that held a joke she hadnt heard yet. Lexa could feel the heat color her cheeks but she ignored it tossing her gym bag over her shoulder and walking alongside the bleachers. The pretty blonde was right on the money actually and she wasnt sure how she felt about it someone watching her games enough to be able to decipher the mood and stance of her plays. The blonde above matched her step alongside her a halfsmile still coloring her features. Lexa shook her head a small scoff falling from her lips. They were hounding me all game. I was making a point. She kept her eyes focused on the manicured field cheeks still burning. The girls voice had a darker tone to it inviting her in for more. Mmm. I think you made it. That explains the tension though. I think I heard someone barkLexa barked a laugh. You tell Kicks you need water and shell throw gasoline. The soccer player risked a glance up at her and wondered if she should regret it enjoying the way the blondes head tipped back with her smile her eyes lighting up in the fluorescent bleacher lights. But shell follow you to hell and back and watch it burn down with you too.Her laughter felt like an invitation dark and easy. She sounds nice.The high wall separating them fell away and Lexa turned to regard her fully for the first time. She was dressed in a loose faded denim jacket a soft tee underneath and dark jeans that hugged the curves of her body. She couldnt help but let her eyes wash over them level with her own eyes and she felt her cheeks warm again. The woman smiled down at her eyes bright. Im Clarke. Lexa. And to her own surprise she held up her own hand. The woman accepted her hand pleasantly warm in her grip. Clarke placed her other hand on Lexas shoulder and Lexas hand fell to her hip guiding her to fall down to her level. Lexa blinked shaken by the familiarity of it all like she had been here done all this before even though she was barely meeting this woman. Her hand stayed on Clarkes hip and they stared at each other for a long moment Lexa drinking in the blue of her eyes. They were close well within each others space and Lexa couldnt help pulling in a deep breath of her scent like the dark fog that covered the leaves in morning light. The woman didnt seem at all bothered by the contact instead regarding Lexa with an amused smile.I know who you are.Lexas cheeks burned and she turned away releasing her hold on Clarkes soft hips. So Ive seen you at the games before. You go to the mens games too Compared to them were like.. Little league.Clarkes posture was easy calm. Lexa found herself struggling not to stare at her. Please. All that alpha blood and posturing Theres actual gameplay here. Besides the views much nicer.Her cheeks were fire but she ignored it. Hopefully the long cast of the lights would hide it. By now they were within distance of the side doors including the entrances into the locker room. The rest of the team was there and the postgame buzz was still going strong. The energy only rocketed higher as Lexa came within distance. She shook her head turning her back to them to block Clarke from any collateral damage as the intensity of the swarm focused her. Well Clarke. I should be going.Her blue eyes glittered back at her. Yeah. I have a date to get back to.Enjoy your date.It wont compare.Clarkes eyes were sparkling and Lexa found herself struck by the clarity of them. Even though the words fell from her lips with a smile she couldnt help thinking that this woman was telling the truth. But that couldnt be right her a sophomore who got a lucky kick in compared to whatever night she had planned. RightA particularly raucous COMMANDEEEEEER cut through the air and finally Lexa turned to her teammates acknowledging their existence and their impending surge. Clarke backstepped her eyes dancing to the freight train of a team barreling towards them. Lexa barely had time to cast her eyes over her shoulder as she braced for the tidal wave. See you around Commander.Anya was packing her backpack as class wrapped up. Shed just gotten the last of her things packed up when the graded lab report fell in front of her. 410 bad conclusion. She growled under her breath. Shed followed the experiment exactly recorded everything and even left notes alongside the margins. All her lab partner had to do was put it all together but apparently he had failed that. Shed meant to doublecheck it before the turnin date but Lexa kept asking if she was going to be at this weeks game work kept calling and she just kept running out of time. The rest of the class was filling out but the blonde was still at the next lab table dropping the last of her things into her backpack.Anya walked over and placed her books down with a thump calling the blondes attention. Im Anya.She had an amused smile. Griffin. Youre on the soccer team.My lab partner is horrible. And yoursGriffin turned her head watching the brunette file out the door without a word. ...Is a noshow. She turned back to Anya her voice dry. Unless its a due date.Finished packing her things Clarke slung her bag over her shoulder and started for the door Anya following beside her. I need an upgrade. Anythings better than what I got. And you need a partner.Thanks for the vote of confidence. Clarkes voice was sour. She nodded nonetheless turning to face Anya at the door. See you WednesdayAnya nodded back. Good. She wasnt expecting Anya to turn the same way when she exited behind her but they fell in step together easily enough. A familiar voice and swath of brunette hair cut through the air and she followed the sound of it to see something sail through the air in front of her. Hey. You forgot this.Lifesaver. Thank you. Anya caught it deftly and Clarke raised her eyes to see Lexa had rounded the corner to fall in step before them.What do you eat when you forget itAnya grimaced. I dont.No wonder youre always grumpy. Lexa turned on her heel walking backwards to face them as she pulled her bag around so she could rummage in it. Clarke listened to the conversation continue with obvious ease and familiarity. Clarke tried to ignore the way her heart sank while putting the pieces together of just how close the two brunettes were. While they shared much of the same mannerisms the two didnt look like they were related. You have another class rightAnya shrugged pocketing what must be a wallet. I got an hour. Wanna get food with meCant. I have a study thing which Im late for. She found whatever she was digging for and tossed it to Anya without warning ending her backpedal and walking towards them so they had to part for her to pass. Youre welcome. There was a tease in her voice a light melody and an eyebrow arched high as she passed them.Anya ripped open the wrapper as Lexa passed. Clarke tried not to wrinkle her nose when she noticed the brunettes scents were all over each other.Hey. Lexa turned in stride her movements so graceful it looked like a dance as her eyes fell back to Anya over her shoulder. We still on for pizza tomorrowDont forget my mushrooms Woods.Anya sneered at her around a mouthful of granola bar. Mushrooms are gross.Lexa was unaffected. She rolled her eyes adding a smirk that made Clarkes heart jump into her throat as she settled her eyes on her for the first time. Bye Clarke.Her cheeks felt hot. She hoped Anya didnt notice but Ravens voice was ringing through the air before she had time to worry about it. GriffinShe shot her roommate a smile that she happily returned her eyes washing over Anyas form before turning back to her. Hey. Im starving.Clarke shrugged. Lets go eat. She turned to Anya extending the offer. You pick the place.Anya smirked balling what was left of the wrapper in her fist and stuffing it into a backpack pocket. I want a burrito the size of my head.Raven grinned falling in step with them. Chipotle then. Theres one in South square.Anya nodded. Cool my class is right by there. I can eat and run.Clarke absolutely noticed the way Ravens eyes washed over Anyas form whenever she wasnt looking. She couldnt deny that they had chemistry. Most people werent used to Ravens sarcasm or dry humor but Anya was quick on the draw returning fire with equal wit and ferocity never missing a beat. The three of them fell into conversation easily and in what felt like no time at all Anya was standing from her seat tossing the foil ball with a perfect overhand into the wastebasket. Well I gotta run. Thanks for inviting me to lunch. And it was good meeting you Raven. Anya nodded back a smirk pulling at the corner of her lips as she shouldered her bag. Raven. See you around.Raven leaned out of her chair as Anya walked away not bothering to hide the way she watched her figure fade as she walked away. Who was that Clarke grinned. Anya. My lab partner. Can we see more of her pleaseClarke laughed but it was followed by an unfortunate frown. Ill see what I can do. I think shes taken though. The disappointment was clear in Ravens voice. Thats a shame. The game had been declining since halftime and by the end it could be described as nothing short of a landslide. Lexa carried the defeat on her shoulders as the team headed back to the locker rooms and Clarke had decided to stick around after the game to offer company. That had been over an hour ago. The field was quiet in the afterglow of the game the scent of upturned dirt and clean grass still hanging in the air around them the fluorescent lighting casting a sheen across the well manicured lawn. She could see Lex eyeing her as the bourbon threaded down her throat hot and torrid and held the flask to her in offering. Lexa took it with a shrug kicking back a shot without a flinch and handing it back.What happened to your partyClarke shrugged taking another pull from the flask before passing it back. I can pregame here. Besides you wont come with me.Lexa shook her head leaning back in the bleachers so she could drape her elbows on the seats behind them. She liked Lexa this way when the stress would fall out of her shoulders and the severe cut fell away from her voice. I dont do parties.Clarke turned to watch her kick back another shot easily. It gave her a chance to appreciate the sharp lines of her jaw the clean cut of her features silhouetted in the artificial light. You used to though.Lexa settled her with a thoughtful look an eyebrow arched gracefully higher before shaking her head with a shrug and handing the flask back. Im here now. Soccer. Classes. Clubs. Scholarships. Clarke nodded a smirk pulling at her lips this time sipping languidly at the rapidly emptying canter. You gotta relax sometime. All work and no play remember Consider it a standing invitation. I guess I picked a pretty good distraction from it right It was weird at first when Anya came here. I was so used to having her around. It took me a while to figure out what to do with myself. Then I just buried myself in classes. It worked out well now were here together.Clarke squinted into the artificial green expanse before the sharp bite of alcohol lacing her tongue. Wait a minute. Whats Anya a junior Im only in class with her cause I took a dual credit. How old does that make youClarke must have hit the nail right on the head because when she turned Lex refused to look at her a blush crawling up her cheeks. Clarke smirked a dark tease lacing through her voice. Youre that young huh So you are a genius thenLexa shook her head Its not like that. Its more like.. Im just hardheaded. Stubborn. And besides books make sense. They dont talk back. Not like people.Clarke smiled at her. You do fine with me.Lexa blushed but she didnt respond to the compliment instead pushed forward. I was 16 when Anya left. So I graduated a year later and by then Anya had her own place. I had taken some summer and dualcredit classes so now Im with her. A sophomore.Clarke smirked handing the flask back. Even in her peripherals she could see the blush crawling up Lexas cheeks. Right. So genius. Got it. Niylah pulled her apartment door closed behind her with a click and stepped into the hallway. The heat was still running through her making her skin run hot and setting her teeth on edge but at least it was manageable now. She turned down the hall to see one of the Woods leaving in a huff. They were nice enough as neighbors went kept to themselves didnt make any noise fed her cat when she went out of town. But the shorter brunette was tearing down the hall like she had something hot on her heels. Tell your friend she owes me eggsAnya she knew her name was leaning against the door jamb nonchalantly a leg swinging lightly as if she didnt have a care in the world her arms crossed loosely as she watched the woman disappear down the hall. Ill let her know. Niylah followed the brunettes path down the hall but she could feel the womans eyes on her as she passed dark and impervious. She slowed her steps her body responding to the slow gaze washing over her. With a sigh she stopped casting her eyes down the hall. The stair door swung shut the brunette gone. When she raised her gaze Anyas deep olives washed over her impassively before falling past her to the empty hall before them. She could smell the change in the womans scent the invitation clear even as her posture remained loose.Niylah cast her eyes down the hallway again but the elevator and stair door sat silent the hallway desolate besides the two of them. With one last glance over her shoulder she turned brushing past the Alpha into the waiting doorway. Her scent grew stronger harsher as she passed the threshold. The door slammed shut behind her and she could feel the warmth of the Alpha right on her heels. Hey can I ask a favor Anya was squinting at the vials bubbling before her her hand scribbling across paper. Whats upI keep going over last weeks lab. I know everything I need is there but I feel like Im missing something. Do you think you could look at my reportAnya wasnt in the business of babysitting but Clarke carried her weight and listened to her instructions. Besides looking at her work directly would give her a clearer view of her knowledge than running any experiment would. She needed to know what she was working with for the rest of the semester. Sure. Let me take a look at it.Clarke produced a ruffled packet a moment later. She would have been annoyed at the poor state of it but the margins were bleeding over with notes equations and calculations running over the printed text. She took her time flipping through the packet. Huh. Youre on the right track. Youre missing a correlation though. Here. Look at what happens to the carbon after the fluoride is introduced.Clarke had joined her leaning over the lab table as they studied the paper together. Crap. How did I miss thatClarke was already scribbling away madly at the report when her phone buzzed.Johnson Can you come in todayAnya cussed typing back a reply before turning back to the stilled vials.Anya What happenedJohnson Were behind schedule again.Anya How I put Nichols on the diatrobe analysis. We should be ahead of schedule.Anya let out a frustrated sigh. Her eyes washed over Clarke muttering and scribbling away at her report an equation blooming on the page before her. She was making all the right conclusions and her brain went on autopilot as she tried to rearrange her day. Pay attention to that restructure. Look what happens to those molecules after the introduction of the catalyst.Shit. Its the same structure as the hydrogendioxide. How did I not see that Anya cussed her knuckle brushing the beaker stand and tipping it over the contents spilling on the table before her. The motion stirred Clarke out of her trance and she flinched reaching for a beaker. Shit sorry. Let me help.Anya shrugged her off brushing Clarkes hand away so she could swipe at the beaker spilling across the countertop. Nah focus on that. I know how it is. Get it out before you lose it. You can do cleanup.Clarke paused torn between the two tasks before her but Anya had already wiped away the last of the spill dropped the dribbling beakers into the sink. Her eyes washed over her phone when it buzzed and she rolled her eyes. Johnson We need to redo his run. Pretty sure he just proved water is a solid.Anya groaned flicking her gloves into the sink before snapping them off with a sigh. Her eyes washed over Clarke still scribbling away at the notes before her. Hey. You workingClarke blinked at her caught offguard by the question so Anya continued dropping her balled gloves into the trash can. Im working in RichardsThompson lab here on campus. And I need some good people. Someone who can actually run within protocols. You should come check it out. Clarkes hand stilled over paper. YeahAnya nodded. She leaned closer grabbing a lone pen and scribbling an address along the crowded margins. You know the Corsus buildingYeah. By the Engineering Quarter.Anya nodded pleased once again that she wasnt stuck explaining common knowledge. Yeah its in there. Tell them I sent you theyll let you in and you can check it out. You can decide from there. Huh. Yeah. Ill check it out.Anya pulled back up to her full height dropping the pen back to paper as her eyes washed over the remains of their experiment. Actually. I need to go clean up a mess. Can you take care of cleanup Results are down.Yeah I got it. Anya raised an apprehensive eyebrow. You sureClarkes nod was confident apparent in the lines of her back the straight line of her posture. Positive. Ill copy your notes on Thursday. Anya was already convinced packing up her bag as Clarke watched on silently. Hey dont forget toneutralize the acids before disposal. She raised her gaze to see the solute already in Clarkes hands. A smile danced behind her eyes and she nodded at Anya before turning away. I got it Woods. Go. Ravens eyes blew wide. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait a minute.Clarke did her beer halfway to her lips. Youre telling me. That Hot Lab Partner is going to be Hot Boss now too Clarke grinned shrugging before resuming the pull of beer halfway to her lips.I dunno.. I like the idea of it. I checked out the lab its clean. And Anya may be a bit short but she tells you exactly what she expects. Shes easy to work for. Oh my god. This just keeps getting better I was mad at first when you dragged me to that soccer game but the view alone was worth it. And now youre telling me she does the sexy scientist look too Im stopping by. I have to see it myself.Clarke laughed finishing her pull and shooting her roommate a look across the table. She has a name you know.Obviously. Hot Boss Lady. Then theres Sexy Scientist. Broody Cheekbones. Oooh how about Sexy Smirk I like that one. Were keeping that one. Clarke frowned into her beer. I dunno. Ive been hanging out with Lexa. And the way she talks about her...Ohhhhh. Oh. I see it. You like her like her.Clarke blushed but didnt deny her accusation. She knew better than to fight Raven she knew her too well. Shes married. Besides I have Finn.Raven snorted into her beer. Oh right. Cuz hes a catch.Stop. Hell come around.Yeah How long you gonna wait til he doesnt Clarke didnt answer and Raven took another swig of beer her brow furrowed in thought as a plan that Clarke knew would be bad for her health formed in her head. No way. Youre working with her now. You have to do the research.Clarke started to shake her head but Raven slammed her hand onto the table making Clarke flinch. I demand it Griffin If theres a chance that woman is single I need to know. I mean have you seen herClarke scoffed a ghost of a laugh falling from her lips. Apparently Ill be seeing a lot more of her. Sounds like she already got me in. I just have to show up. Ravens eyes glittered. Dont you fucking waste this Griffin. Do this for me. I call upon the Holy Best Friend Concordant. Clarke sighed in defeat taking another pull from her beer.And please write this down. Ive been over this with Evans twice. Anya leaned across Clarke picking up a blue beaker and swirling the liquid in it. You HAVE to distill this before you add it to the solution. If you use the unconcentrated form its going to fuck the whole thing. False positives across the board. But Clarke couldnt hear her anymore. Her pen was suddenly hovering over her notepad her eyes unfocused as Anya brushed past and she could smell Lexa on her the smirk on the corner of her lips the glitter of her eyes the way her hands were warm against her hip as she guided her to the ground the strength and ripple of corded muscle beneath her fingers the deep emerald of her eyes.Are you and Lexa together The world swirled back into view and Anya was blinking at her the distaste clear on her features. But she was already here and the curiosity was burning eating at her. She had to know.Anya let out a scoff. They had been strictly professional thats what made their relationship so easy. Her eyes hardened and Clarke could read the thats clearly none of your business in them but Clarke met her gaze intent on getting an answer. Anya met her gaze but gave up when Clarke matched it letting out a scoff as she rolled her eyes.Gross. Shes my sister. But you smell like each other . Clarke shook that thought off. She didnt need to go through life advertising that she could pick up on those pheromones. But. Youre clearly not related.Were adopted dumbass.Oh. Of course you are. Suddenly all the pieces clicked into place. She was remembering all the conversations with Lexa her easy smile the way her eyes lit up when she laughed the way she talked about Anya like they had always known each other.A heavy sigh escaped the taller woman next to her and she blinked falling back to reality.Can we get back to work nowYeah. Sorry. Distill the dymethazine solute. Whats after that Sisters. Raven blinked at her wordlessly as she clicked the door shut behind her. She dropped her backpack by the door toeing off her shoes as Raven watched her with an unreadable expression. Adopted sisters.A grin spread across her face like wildfire. Oh you are getting so many roommate points for this. I fucking love you GriffinRaven disappeared down the hall without a word leaving Clarke standing forlornly in the hallway.

Shit What can I do though since she caught me again while watching her brother He is extremely attractive. tall and having a wide shoulder. His twitching muscles make the hearts of all women bleed. His long dark brown hair is tied behind his head yet I can still feel how smooth and silky it is. I want to reach out and touch him with every fiber of my being.No not now neverHe makes a sudden turn as if I were observing him. His eyes were a dark green that sparkled in the sunlight. He appears to be looking in every window as he searches for anything. But after that he turns and resumes his work. As if they were still ignoring me. Once more disappointment appears in my eyes or heart. He disregarded me once more.He lied.He cheated.No Im simply coming to enjoy the flowers and some fresh air.Oh no nothing is wrong with enjoying a handsome bees company while viewing flowers. His parents couldnt be further apart. One side is as soft as a cloud while the other is as hard as a rock.Well look around its not just you consuming him. Jessie shakes her head two girls who are dressed more casually watch him walk towards the main gate. I despise girls because they constantly approach him yet I am quite familiar with him. Nobody can keep Ronald away from me since he always wants to be with me. Though we may be at various degrees love has no bounds.Peoples hearts and souls which are constantly willing to bleed are seen by love.Shit Your heart is audible to you. Tell him you know...Tell him what he is and who he is. My heart stops beating for a brief period of time. He is right here behind us.

Jessie offers me a quick wink before he finishes his sentence and leaves. Just Ronald and I are here. Im held in place as his approaching footsteps draw nearer. My hands are trembling and Im perspiring cold sweat. His bodys heat touched my back.My little Rosee posee turned around. Shit When I was six years old and he was ten he started calling me Rosee Posee. He always compliments my bodyguard in front of everyone but when we are alone he diverts my attention with his peculiar antics. He made me weep by yanking my hair. But he gave me chocolate as I began to cry. However he gave me chocolate and candy when I started weeping since he despises my tears.He sent me a bouquet of flowers when I was in my first period and made me happy. He has always been first for me. I had never kissed before. When he kissed me on my birthday he made me shudder and then he stopped. We were never on the same page when I discovered him dating other women between these years. He obviously had sex but I dont care about it anymore. I lost him years ago and now theyre just memories.Just inviting you to my birthday celebration. I say. I extended an invitation to him without turning.Youre eighteen.Like you would forget. I managed to get my space with a little prodding. He serves as a warning for me as we come to an end.Rose...No please. Dont destroy it for me its a wonderful day. Bring and take. He drew me against him and I lost track of him. His body was covered in sweat and I could smell the strong floral scent. I wanted to reach out and touch his bare chest.Tell me we are similar. Its merely a misunderstanding and you already know that Im yours forever Rosee Posee. How blatantly did he lie There is no confusion here. He misled me. He deceived me.Just misunderstanding She was with you I saw.I noticed you with him too. While Im busy giggling at his chest he speaks on my trembling lips.I thi...What the hell just happened Christ Ronald.. When we heard a voice which turned out to be Ronalds mother we both leapt. I felt a push from Ronald. Oh right how could I forget that he is her mothers puppetI warned you to avoid the rich bitch. When she throws herself at someone shes always hoping for a chance and when she needs to be satisfied youre simply trash. She spoke while keeping an eye on me. How unkind is she to meMom its not...Its time for you to stop chasing after my poor boy Miss Rose I believe your mother is calling for you. Ronald should have said something by now but nothing has. He never stands up for either of us. Ronald is only her mum.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/50163031,Her,Ill go crazy if I dont find her. Ill take over the company whether the Manentes like it or not. He took off his jacket and undid the top button of his shirt then returned to looking out the window of the speeding limo in vain for her. One of his lieutenants responded something. Itll be better for everyone this way. He responded into his phone his tone bored as he tried to scan the pedestrian faces. Theyll thank me later he hung up. His phone chirped another message from Anna. He rolled his eyes not wanting to deal with her. Ill go crazy if I dont find her. He leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes. And there she was again. Five years since the accident five years since the dreamthe doctors had called it a comatose vision. But he had spent five years dreaming about a woman he knew he had met once. He could smell her dark hair it smelled like flower blossoms he could smell her skin it smelled like honey he could look into her blue eyes rimmed with dark lashes. He could almost feel the smoothness of her lips against him. Whenever he was weak and fucked Anna or someone else he always imagined her his curse his obsession his treasure . Tesoro. When the car stopped in front of the tarmac he saw Domenico Mario and a few others waiting for him to board the small private jet first. The pilot greeted him when they entered the plane. A flight attendant passed him a glass of neat whisky. He paid no attention to her as she flushed when their fingers grazed each other when she passed him another whisky when they plane was cruising at altitude. Over the course of the next whisky he turned when he felt her dark eyes piercing him like daggers. He handed the drink to his halfbrother took her to the lavatory and fucked her mouth with little interest. Then he returned to his seat sipped his whisky while she cleaned up the mess in the lavatory theyd defiled. Mario put down his newspaper Back in your fathers day theyd shoot us all dead. He rolled his eyes. Back in my fathers day we used to bootleg. Now we run the biggest companies in Europe. He sipped his whisky and raised an eyebrow at his consigliere. I am the head of the Torricelli family and the new era unless you wish to bring back to the old ways. Mario swallowed roughly. If you want a nice shooting you may have a new opportunity. Massimo said allowing Mario to relax. Domenico he turned to look at his brother tell your men to start looking for Alfredo. He finished his whisky. The sun over Sicily was setting when they landed in Catania. The scorching hot Sicilian sun blasting his skin and eyes he put his sunglasses on. Mount Etna loomed in the horizonperfectly visible. Tourists should be happy he thought as they entered the airconditioned building. The guys from Aruba want to meet with you about the issues we talked about earlier. Domenico said walking by his side. We have to take care of the Palermo clubs too. He listened intently silently making a list of things that still needed tending to when everything became dark and he saw her Tesoro. No he reasoned with himself. It wasnt her it never was. He had things to do. Like finding the cocaine dealer who vanished. They continued through the airport. When they were approaching the car he saw her again. Im going crazy . He entered the car and pulled Domenico in with him. Its her he rasped pointing at the girl marching down the walkway away from them. Its her. Domenico instructed the driver to follow her carefully but his head was spinning. He was losing his mind Holy shit. Domenico breathed and Massimos heart skipped a beat. She was real. It was her. She was there. She turned her head squinting her eyes slightly not seeing him through the dark panes of the window. Her eyes her lips her noseeverything he had dreamed. He reached for the handle and Domenico stopped him. A man with moppish hair and thick glasses was calling over to her and she turned and walked his way. Not now Massimo. She was real she was there He could have her He would have her. The car sped off. What the fuck are you doing He demanded his brother and driver. Shes with others. We dont know who they are. Im sending people after her right now. Youll know who she is before we reach home. Domenico said patiently. Youve waited so longyou can wait a few more hours. He could have killed his brother right there but the rational part of his brain knew he could not have her then and there. You have one hour. Massimo growled You have sixty minutes to tell me who she is. When they reached the driveway of the estate and stepped out of the car. Domenicos men walked over and handed him an envelope. He headed towards the library without another word needing to be alone to digest what he had seen. In the library he wasted no time tearing the envelope open and spilling the contents on the desk. He clutched a photo in disbeliefno more painstakingly detailed paintings ordered from artistsshe had a name a pastand a future with him. There was a knock at the door Not now he barked not moving his eyes from the photos and notes. Roxanne Hughes. He whispered stumbling slightly over consonants of her last name. That would have to change. After thirty minutes he moved from his desk to his armchair. Massimo Domenico asked peering through a crack in the door. He entered when Massimo didnt react. What now Bring her here Massimo ordered still devouring her photos and information. Youll go get her Yes Ill go to her hotel and tell her I had these visions of us when I nearly diedno were going to take her. There was no hesitation in his voice when he stopped being sarcastic. Send people to the room of that he glanced down at the name of the moppish man shed been traveling with Martin. They are to find out who he is. Ill ask Carlo. Hes right there. Domenico said. You dont have to look too far you know a female voice called from behind the door. Anna walked in Im right here. Fuck hed forgotten she had sent him some text. WellIll leave you two. Domenico grinned stupidly Ill take care of that thing and well finish our business tomorrow. he said and left. Do you want to hit me The blonde asked as she approached Its been a while since Ive been spanked. She straddled him rubbing herself against his zipper her fingers loosening his tie. He grabbed her hands away from his neck and for a moment she must have thought he was trying something new but when he pushed her off and left her on the floor in the library did she realize their arrangement had ended. All he wanted was his treasure. Eight Hours Earlier Her feet hurt they always hurt. Standing for eight hours then walking back to her small New York City apartment because it was too hot to be stuck underground in subway stations. Though shed only left work a couple of hours ago standing and packing while feeling her feet throbbed and ached didnt exactly make her excited to board a plane. Roxy its 9 already. We have to be at the airport in an hour. Marty reminded her. His bag was already packed along with his work bag. Even on their Sicilian vacation he couldnt take 100 of the time off. That was his burden starting a software company with a few of his engineer friends contracting out their services to tech giants. Just the three of them. And he loved it. For her the hotel was a means to an end. Finally finishing her degree and quitting the terrible front desk job shed had and the more than occasional maid shift. The job that required nights and weekends all on her feet. The job that kept making her delay her graduation but scheduling her just enough to make ends meet but not enough to make her want to stay forever. She wasnt supposed to still be in college at 29. She wasnt supposed to be working as the front desk attendant at the five star hotel that she had been for the past 11 years. She wasnt supposed to ensure she packed her knee brace in her carryon she wasnt supposed to have had to defer her education this semester because her manager had fired three people within the last three months. She wasnt supposed to be doing a lot of things now. I know she rubbed her tired eyes. Shed been packing since shed finished the night shift and came home when the sun was rising. I just cant Here Marty walked into their room and handed her an iced coffee. I know you want to sleep on the plane but well miss the flight if youre just standing there. She sipped the coffee I need my toothbrush and makeup in the bathroom and then Ill be finished I think. When she had hobbled into the bathroom to gather the missing items she got a look at herself in the mirror. She didnt look great. Her dark hair which shed cut into a chin length bob was a little sweaty since her walk home coincided with the hot NYC sunrise. Her eyes had bags like they always did when she pulled an all night shift and her skin didnt look awake either. Shed spent so much time working shed barely had water last night. She shook her head she was just tired. She placed mascara concealer an eyebrow pencil and BB cream into her toiletry bag along with her togo toothbrush and paste. Then she hobbled into the closet and changed into the tank top Hawaiian shirt cotton shorts and slipon sneakers shed prepared for the long flight to Sicily. When shed hobbled into the small combined living room and kitchen she saw Marty with his glasses pushed down his nose as he typed furiously on his phone. He was always on his phone. Ever since hed started his business his phone was an unceremonious third member of his and Roxys relationship. And shed resented it. They had been together for nearly 11 years putting each other through college shit jobs and shittier managers. And theyd always come out on top with their relationship still intact. But this phone thing relevantly new in the past year since hed finished his masters degree in computer science or computer engineering or coding she wasnt too sure. But whatever hed gotten his degree in he was making enough money to cover his student debt his share of the rent and other bills. Besides she could put up with the workaholic it had been a while since hed shown this much passion about anything and hed always made her feel safeand calm. Shed always had anxiety and claustrophobia in some shape. Usually it meant keeping a window open so she could feel the breeze or see the sun. Sometimes it meant walking instead of taking a cab or the subway her bum knee be damned. Being trapped in a plane for hours on end where anything could happen and shed be stuck in her seat she made sure to pack her antianxiety medication in her carry on. Her and Martys friends were waiting for them in the departure hall of the airport. Kathy and Mike whod been together a year and were already thinking about marrying.They had all been friends since their freshman year at college where theyd meet at a mixer for undecided majors. While Marty and Roxy had coupled up quickly Kathy and Mike loved each other from afar until a year ago when hed made a huge drunken confession at his Halloween Party. They two had been inseparable ever since. During the stopover in Rome after successfully sleeping through the first long leg of the trip Roxy had taken her medication and let her mind wander while she waited for it to kick in. Shed never been to Italy before. Shed barely ever been out of New York before shed been to New Jersey a couple of times for Bed Bath and Beyond or a friends House Warming but New York had everything. Except Benedetta. Benedetta Rossi her best friend since kindergarten whod moved to Sciliy when she was 21 to help care for her ailing Sicilian grandparents and their authentic Sicilian hotel. Benedetta the child of Sicilian Immigrants had spoken with a thick Italian accent until well into fifth grade. She had been able to maintain her scholarship to graduate on time with a degree in business management and accounting. They had never lost touch. Beni was the reason Roxy Marty Kathy and Mike had been able to afford this trip. Beni was giving them a suite for pennys on the dollar or whatever the Euro conversion was. When they landed in Catania the sun was setting and as the four waited for the shuttle to Benis hotel Marty Mike and Kathy had made stops for the bathroom and water. But Roxy needed to be outside. As far away from the confines of the cylindrical coffin that was the plane as she could beoutside in the sweltering heat watching the smoking summit of Mount Etna seemed right. And in making her way out of the airport shed nearly knocked into him a big Italian man being followed by a bunch of men in dark suits walking out of the airport terminal. They didnt stop as she swerved out of their way. She closed her eyes and stayed outside for a little longer letting the dying suns rays hit her skin when three black SUVs drove by. The middle one seemed to slow down for an instant but she couldnt see through the darkened windows. Rox She heard Marty call out Beni just called the shuttle is running a little bit late The Giardini Albergo di Rossi welcomed its American guests with tall red flowers and a romantic garden motif. Really ritzy darling Roxy told her friend. Bennedetta was an oliveskinned dark eyed dark haired vision of Venus. Sicilian life seemed to agree with her more than New York City life did. She smelled mildly salty like the ocean but mostly of fresh flowers that decorated the grounds and interiors of her familys small hotel. Her long dark hair was twisted delicately at the nape of her neck. And she seemed to shine brightly as she and Roxy traded inside jokes. Not as ritzy as my hotel on Park Ave Beni quipped back You should see the maids I have for my maids there. I suppose my butler will live without a butler for this one extravaganza . Roxy replied. I suppose its a sacrifice I am willing to make. As Beni led them to their suite she took the long detour through the beautiful hotel grounds. Past the pool the restaurant there was even a patio that held nightly parties. I thought you said it was a small beachside hotel Kathy remarked as they passed by the second patio with a well stocked bar. Beni smiled sadly Weve recently gotten an investor to um upgrade the facilities. It used to be this really small hotel by the beach but with the big corporations like Hilton and Four Seasons weve had to find some way to make this place stand out as a resort. Roxy remembered the pictures she used to bring to show and tell of a small seven bed and breakfast and her grandparents standing by an old sign in Italian no one but Beni could read. Giardini Rossi was a small beautiful hotel back then. Now it looked large and beautiful without any of its old world charm. Her stomach grumbled I can already taste the pizza. You should go to the restaurant Tortuga on the grounds. Its got really good pizza and really good atmosphere. Beni suggested. And really good wine After they dropped off their luggage in their suite. They strode into Tortuga. At the entrance there was a white sailcloth that waved in the wind. The dining area was divided by cozy nooks enclosed by heavy wooden beams to support the cloth roof. In the dining room it had glass tables white chairs and sofas and candles everywhere. It smelled like the sea and the decedent Italian food. It was packed and Roxy thought Beni must have called ahead because they were seated immediately. She felt eyes on her. I feel like Im being watched she whispered to Marty. Youre just anxious. You havent taken your medication since we were in New York. She scanned the restaurant and when not seeing anyone looking at her she returned to look at the menu. After the waiter took everyones orders Roxy excused herself to the restroom. She wandered around the restaurant until she spotted an alcove by the wooden bar thinking it was the restroom she walked into only to quickly realize it was the door to the kitchen. When she turned around only to hit the hard chest of a tall Italian man. His black eyes fixed an icy stare on her. You seem lost he said in accented English. She wasnt sure if he was Scilian or just another lost tourist like her. I can help you if you tell me what youre looking for. Uh rrrestroom please she stuttered his presence domineering over her. He smiled presenting perfectly straight white teeth and placed a hand on her back between her shoulder blades. His touch sent unwelcome shivers down her spine like his hands were ice cold. He directed her to the restroom and then disappeared when she went to thank him. When she returned to her table she was met with a glass of wine and a waiter brought a bottle before shed even finished her sip. Marty shot her a look and laughed You boozer I thought you had to pee. I did She turned to the waiter I didnt order this she tried to tell the waiter. The waiter ignored her and placed the wine in front of her turned and nodded at someone in the restaurant. She turned her head looking for who the waiter was indicating she saw him. The Italian man who spoke English stuck out in black linen trousers a black shirt and black loafers. He raised his glass of wine at her. She turned away. When dinner was served she realized shed ordered sea scallops Marty had ordered squid Kathy had ordered clams and pasta and Mike had ordered octopus. They all sampled each others dishes. Enjoying the flavors and wine when Martys phone chirped. Holy Marty exclaimed. Do you know what time it is Its midnight. Happy birthday Roxy. He placed a kiss on her lips and said Im sorry to tell you that I already told the waiter. What The waiter appeared with a small selection of deserts and a single lit candle and then began to sing in Italian. She flushed pink until they finished their song. When they left Kathy raised her glass May you find what youre looking for always have what you want and fulfill all your dreams You mean finally finish my bachelors degree Thats the spirit She said picking up a small cake and eating it. After midnight the restaurant turned into a club. The white base became drenched in hot pinks electric blues vibrant purples and intense orange. It was her turn to refill everyones drinks. As she made her way to the bar she felt like she was being watched again. Shed had to elbow people to get through the crowd they had to have been staring at the gawky tourist who didnt know how to say excuse me in Italian. But then she saw him out of the corner of her eye leaning against one of the wooden beams and showing no emotion. He was tall dark and handsome. His black hair was styled with gel but still looked soft. His sharp jaw was covered with meticulously trimmed dark stubble his lips were full and well defined. His stare was piercing. It was the stare of a wild animal waiting to pounce. He was tall taller than Marty. Taller than most of the men she had regular interaction with. She looked away from him focusing on finding her boyfriend and friends. He was at her side immediately. Are you lost Do you need help Im fine Roxy asserted the alcohol shed consumed making her braver than she was. You dont have to stare at me. Have you been doing it all night The man smirked. And her hands flexed around the three drinks she was carrying. I watch the club he informed her I supervise the staff check on the guests and look for women in need. In that casethank you. Goodbye. She said quickly moving into the crowd uncomfortable in his presence. See you around Roxanne. She turned halfway the ice in the alcohol clicking against their glasses wondering how he learned her nameher government name. But he was gone. Had he been eavesdropping on her No he couldnt have. Nobody but her grandmother called her Roxanne and that was when she was in trouble. How did he know she was Roxanne She didnt have any more time to think. Kathy had wandered over with a smile.Did you get lost A little Roxy lied sheepishly. Why had he been looking at her like that How did he know her name She woke up with a terrible headache. She was never a drinker and with the amount of alcohol shed consumed the night before while it wasnt much she was lucky she woke up in the bed and not with her head in the toilet. She crawled out of bed and stumbled to the bathroom where shed kept medicine. After she took it and got a cup of water she looked around. Marty was gone. So was his laptop. Hed left a message on her side table saying there was an emergency and he had to work but hoped he would finish quickly. It was her birthday and hed chosen work. She wouldnt cry not out in the room. She slunk into the shower and let herself weep. She could hear people down by the pool laughing and having fun and decided it was no use waiting for him in the room. She rifled through her luggage and found the one bikini she owned and put it on the light green cotton shorts and the matching cuban collar shirt cover up set and huarache sandals. Then she went to the pool area. Mike and Kathy were sprawled out on chaise lounges by the pool sipping ice cold cocktails with festive umbrellas and fruit. Beni was just here Mike said Shes working this afternoon and then shell meet us for dinner and shes done for the rest of vacation. Beni Roxy smiled had never let her down before. Shed promised that she was taking time off and Roxy could trust that she was. Even over in Italy Beni kept every phone call date they had responded in a timely manner to every email and still kept Roxy updated on her love life. Roxy took off her coverup laid down on the chaise and spent the rest of the day alone. Youre upset about Marty arent you Kathy asked. Because hes still working in the office center Lets get food Mike said Ill get Marty. That bastard can spend one day without his laptop. He got up put on his tshirt and headed to the lobby. She turned to Kathy I feel like Ill never be number one with him. Not anymore. He spends more time working that stupid computer company than with me. We havent had sex in 6 months. Kathy rolled to her side and propped up on an elbow You know it happens Rox you and Marty have been together more than a decade. Youre bound to have rough patches. Weve had rough patches before Kathy this isnt like those times. Hesdistant. Maybe its me she laughed sardonically Maybe theres something wrong with me. Maybe its because I dont want to get married until I graduate. Maybe I got ugly. Maybe hes bored of me. Kathy jumped to her feet and gestured for me to get up. You need a drink youre stressed and overthinking. Just look around were in Sicily were going to be with Beni soon. Mike will threaten to destroy the stupid computer Marty will get scared and youll be having sex the rest of vacation. Roxy grinned she redressed in her coverup set and huaraches and followed Kathy to the bar in the lobby. Kathy ordered Roxy to drink and then went to her room to get her purse and ask Mike about lunch plans. Roxy went to the bar and ordered a glass of white wine spritzer. Thats it She heard a mans voice behind her I thought your heart belonged to vodka cranberry She turned around and froze. There he was standing right in front of her. Only he wasnt dressed in black anymore. He wore offwhite linen pants and a light peach shirt. It was the perfect compliment to his sunkissed skin. He pulled his sunglasses lower down his nose and fixed her with a cold stare. He called out to the bartender in Italian. The bartender paid attention only to him. Are you She crossed her arms. Twice in two days must be a coincidence. He steeled his gaze on her Its not a coincidence happy twentyninth birthday Roxanne. May the coming year be the best in your life. He said gently his words caressing her ear. He placed a delicate kiss on his cheek. How did he know her age How did he find her on the other side of the resort Wasnt he the restaurant manager Mi scusi the bartender broached. Roxy turned around in front of her was a vodka cranberry a bottle of top shelf vodka next to it and a small vanilla cupcake with a single candle on the counter. She spun around again to face the mystery man who had vanished. Again. Well well Kathy said with a smile approaching the bar. You were supposed to have a glass of wine and now youre ordering a bottle of vodka. I havent seen VodkaRox since spring break junior year. I didnt order this Roxy said scanning her surroundings nervously for the mystery Italian. When she didnt see him she pulled out her credit card and offered it to the bartender. In mangled English he refused the payment assuring her the tab had been paid. Kathy gave her a curious look and took the vodka with a couple of cups and went back to the pool. Roxy snubbed the candle out and followed her friend. She was irritated to say the least. There were dozens of different scenarios playing out in her head the least of which involved the mysterious manager. The only thing that had come to her mind was that he was some Italian Perv that tried to sleep with certain guests as part of a back of house betting pool. There had been a couple of former workers at the hotel that had been like that at her hotel. They were irritating but mostly harmless. Judging by his expensive clothes and shoes and good looks he was probably a frequent winner. As she and Kathy passed the bottle of vodka she got more focused and more irritated that Marty had chosen work over her. On her birthday . When they finished the bottle and Roxy had finished the cupcake Marty and Mike arrived looking happy. So how about that lunch Marty asked with a nervous grin. Is that all you want to say VodkaRox slurred. Roxy there was an emergency I he started. I dont care her voice was high Its my fucking birthday. You should have been inside this morning kissing me by the pool and drinking with me today. Rox he started again. Lunch was hours ago she continued her rant swaying slightly by the way. And where the fuck were you She wrapped her arms around herself. He tried to put a hand on her shoulder but she swatted him off. Stumbling she took off to the lobby. She didnt care as she crossed the hall and found herself on the street. Her eyes watering and the alcohol numbing she continued walking. The streets of Giardini the trees speckled with flowers growing along the pavement were distorted as tears and alcohol blurred her vision. For the first time in 11 years with Marty she felt insecure and alone. When the sun was setting and the alcohol had mostly worn off she found a small caf√© and scanned a menu. Vino meant wine and she needed wine. To face the rest of the worst birthday shed ever had. Before she could order an old Italian woman placed a glass in front of her and said something in Italian while gently stroking her hand. Though she didnt understand Italian shed pretended that the old woman was saying that all men were bastards unworthy of tears even if they were a great partner for 11 years. She sat at the table drinking glass after glass and staring at the sea until it got dark. The old woman placed a tiramisu in front of her and Roxy ate it thinking of how this was the closest thing shed had to a birthday cake today. Well second thing. She reminded herself thinking of the cupcake shed eaten early. When she felt ready to return and face the scene shed made and hopefully get consoled by Beni and Kathy she stood up and tried to pay but the old woman shrugged her off. Drunk and still sad she walked the mostly deserted winding streets to Albergo di Rossi. Two black SUVs passed by along with a refreshing breeze. The night was hot she was drunk her birthday was ending and everything feltwrong. She felt light not in a comforting way but in the way where she couldnt feel her joints. Her body felt weird nauseous and dizzy. Not a drunk dizzy either. And tired. She felt as if she closed her eyes for a couple of seconds and shed fall asleep where she was. She looked around panic building quickly in her body. Her breathing labored. The last thing she saw before it went black were the lights of approaching cars.,Explicit,dead dove do not eatCanon Rewritesomewhat canon complianti fixed it because it is badi am adding a plotthere is no beta because im ashamed to be writing thisnot ashamed enough to not fix it because its bad and needs to be fixedRewritefoe fictionAngstAngst/HorrorPotentially Slow UpdatesPorn With Plot

https://archiveofourown.org/works/40752285,Tsarevna,Sitting on my bed in my room alone has its pros. I can focus on everything thats going on around me and outside of my room. I have my legs crossed and eyes shut focusing on the voice outside in the hallway as they are getting louder and closer.My breathing got heavier and I played with the hem of my gym shirt on my lap while I still had my eyes closed. It helps me keep calm before the storm. My mama taught me that one stormy night when our papa lashed at us and nearly beat her to death.Breath hitched in my throat as the heavy boots stopped right in from of the door to my room but I waited as I was ordered to do every day. Wait like a welleducated lady for an order from my papa.Three sharp knocks and the door opened revealing Ivan papas second in command. His face was stony and eyes cold as ice when he looked at me and opened his mouth to speak.Lets go. Your father is expecting you. His voice the same shade of cold and before I could even get up he was already by my side yanking me up by my elbow.I stumbled over my feet nearly falling but I recovered and quickly went for the door keeping my head down. As we walked down the hall to the basement we met with my older brother Nikolas and his guard.The difference between us was that he held his head high as if everything around us was his. His smug look and smirk greet me while his eyes take me in from top to the bottom.Well hello –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥–∞—è —Å–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞. dear sister I flinched under his cold tone but answer either way.Hello –±—Ä–∞—Ç brother.My answer seemed to satisfy him as he quite happily and still with the same creepy smirk walked down the stairs to the basement and left me behind him. I was frozen in one place the soknown shivers creeping down my back and I could hear my heart beating in my ears. I wanted to turn around and run as fast and far as I could be anywhere else than here.A sharp nudge to the centre of my spine made me nearly fall down the stairs and my feet decided to function again. I slowly descended into the pits of hell for me and the grunts and pants from people practising and fighting got louder with each step I take.The heavy set of steellike doors opened and we step through to the lions den of my fathers underground gympractice ring. He sat at the back of the room on a high chair looking over everything and as we step through silence took place and eyes turn to us. My brother grind and greeted a few people before striding up to my father with me on his heels silently walking by trying not to get noticed.–º–æ–π —Å—ã–Ω my son Father stood up with a big smile and hugged my brother firmly before setting his eyes on me. His face went from happy to disgust and he just scoffed under my presence.Nikolas was always the golden child I was and am a liability. Unwanted. Unnecessary. Stain on my papas shirt. I looked down at my feet and started to play with the hem of my tshirt once more.Prepare yourself Papa commanded and Nikolas happily walked over to the fighting ring tossing his shirt in the process revealing a set of hard abs he works so hard on. I scribble after him getting in the position at the opposite side of the ring and studying my brother. He was jumping around moving his hands warming up. Papa sat back down and leans forward watching us with fire in his eyes.Start His strong voice broke something in me and before I could even react Nikolas delivered a hard blow to my side knocking me down to the floor. I gasped at the sudden impact and tried to stand up quickly only to get kicked again to my stomach. The survival instinct kicked in making me roll away from my brothers impacts and jump to my feet in a defence position.We start to circle each other like hungry lions no one of us dared to make the first move. The smug smirk on Nikolas face makes me shiver once more but I dont want to back down. I moved quickly trying to knock him off his feet with my own only for him to jump up and land on my ankle. I heard a decent crack and a sharp pain shoot through my whole leg.I screamed like a dying animal and clunch my ankle scribbling away but my brother wasnt finished just yet. Before I could run away completely and lose another battle he grabbed me by the collar of my shirt and delivered a hard blow to my face. Pain shot through my left cheek up to my head and black spots took place in my vision. And another this time to my collar bone and another to my rib cage. Another two cracks and the same wellknown pain.He was doing it over and over again until my papa raised his hand and the punches stopped. I was laying on the floor blood everywhere and barely conscious. He slowly walked over and crouched in front of me lifting m head by my hair. My grey eyes met with his dark ones as he studied me and then let go making my head fall with a thud to the hard cement floor.Before I could register what is going on two pairs of strong hands grabbed me and took me somewhere where Ive been more in my life than my room sometimes. Papa followed closing the door and breathing out the smoke from his cigaret.You know Julija he said my name with so much hatred like it was poison you are taking up space. I blame your whore of a mother for bearing you and you for breathing the precious air. You will never be me rightful daughter just a punch bag for my men to entertain. He laughed and my blood ran cold.Gesturing to the two men they bound my wrists with a chain and hauled me up hooking the chain on a hook in the centre of the room. One of them took a knife out of the side pocket of his trousers and stripped me of my tshirt leaving me only in my bra. Papa circle them around and took his cigaret out when he was right behind me.Remember my words –î–æ—á–∫–∞. You are nothing. And with that the hot end of the cigaret met with my back and the scream made its way out of my throat like every other day.,Mature,Russian MafiaItalian MafiaReverse HaremRomanceBlood and ViolenceTorture

SPOILERS For those who havent read 365 Days two sequel books there will be some references to those books in the story as it is set after the ending of the trilogy. I slowly walked down the plush cream carpeted hallway that led to one of our biggest suites. In my hands I carried a small silver tray on which was a tall glass filled with freshly squeezed orange juice. It was 2am in the morning. I was not meant to be doing room service at all my job was to clean rooms and I had only been sleeping for four hours when I was awakened by the hotels head housekeeper. A guest had specifically requested that I should bring a glass of fresh orange juice to their suite and Hotel Delegate prided itself on catering to their guests wishes. After I had hurriedly pulled on my black uniform scraped my long curly hair back into a bun and washed my face I had been handed the silver tray by a member of our room service team.I was tired and felt nervous too. It was strange that the guest had specifically requested to see me. All I knew so far was that he was a powerful businessman named Massimo Torricelli. I only hoped that everything went smoothly and he had no reason to complain about me. When I reached the entrance of the suite I took a deep breath before knocking firmly on the door. I was taken aback when the door opened to reveal a stocky bald man in a black suit with an earpiece. His face was void of expression and his eyes were a cold blue. He scrutinised me carefully from head to toe before taking the tray from me and setting it down on a table. You can come in.As soon as I entered the suite he held up a hand. Before you meet my boss I need to pat you down. When he saw me hesitate he frowned at me then shrugged his bulky shoulders. Or you can leave. The choice is yours.I raised my arms and stretched them out. He came closer and ran his hands slowly over my body with a firm touch. I was uncomfortable when his hands lingered over my chest and I could see his breathing start to deepen as he crouched down to run his hands up my legs one at a time. When one of his clammy hands crept under the skirt of my uniform I quickly stepped away from him eyeing him warily as he stood up again.His blank look turned into a small leer for a few brief moments. He gestured to his left. You can go to see him now.I quickly picked up the tray and hurried past the security guard which caused the orange juice to spill slightly. I sighed but was still relieved to have escaped from him as I walked onwards to the lounge. My footsteps slowed as I reached the seating area. In the middle of the circular couch sat an extremely handsome man who had dark hair piercing brown eyes and an olive complexion. I noticed his hands were marked with tattoos. Hello sir. Here is the orange juice you requested. I stepped forward and carefully placed the tray down onto the glass coffee table. Is there anything else I can do for you or may I leave nowHe laughed a rich bitter sounding laugh that emanated from deep down inside. Then he stood up from the sofa and even from the short distance between us I could see how tall he was. The difference in our height became more clear as he walked around the coffee table and came to stand in front of me. His brown eyes darkened as he stared down at me with a cold ruthless expression. No you may not leave Laura. His Italian accent made every word sound like a caress.I bristled inside as he got my name completely wrong and struggled to keep myself from frowning at him. Fine sir. What can I do for youYou seem unhappy baby girl His eyes softened slightly. Its not nice is it To have someone call you by the wrong name But to me you are very similar to Laura. Your petite body your sweet face and creamy skin made me think of her when I first caught sight of you. But your eyes and hair do not match hers. Laura doesnt have amber eyes or curly hair. I will never be with Laura again but I believe you will make a good substitute for her.If theres nothing else you require then I must leave sir I replied forcing a smile as I warily took a step backwards. I could sense that something was not right that I was in danger. I hope you continue to have a pleasant stay with us.He smiled as he crossed his arms over his chest. No I cant let you leave. This time I will make sure you stay with me Laura. Stay with me forever. He nodded sharply but I could see his eyes were not on me. There was someone behind me but before I could turn to see who it was I felt my arm getting pricked by a needle then the world around me went dark.When I awoke I was lying on an old iron frame single bed in a small sparsely decorated room. I winced at the harsh brightness of the naked lightbulb in the ceiling and it took a few moments to my eyes to adjust to the light. I put a hand to my head as I sat up feeling a dull ache there. I was now wearing only my underwear my maid uniform tights and shoes were gone. When I stood up from the bed I saw a table with a neatly folded black silk dress with long sleeves and shiny black ballet flats which had a soft inner lining.I did not like the idea of wearing the dress but I knew I would feel less vulnerable once I could cover up more. So I put on the dress which fit me quite snugly once I did all the buttons up. It was a little too tight for my liking but at least the hem reached my knees and the neckline was a modest cut. Just as I reached out to try the door I was startled when the door was unlocked.. It opened to reveal the lecherous bald security guard. Come out Don Massimo has asked to see you.I quickly stepped out of the room not because I wanted to but because I knew it was safer for me to be out in the open and not enclosed in a small room with him. I looked at him warily as he took hold of my arm and pulled me along with him. I can walk on my own I exclaimed hurriedly. Let go of me.I can carry you if thats what you wish He leered at me lasciviously. I know how to handle women like you. I enjoy it very much.I shuddered not daring to say anything else lest he actually do what he had told me he would do. We passed down a few narrow twisting hallways before we headed up a flight of stone stairs and down a wider hallway. The guard stopped outside two large wooden doors guarded by two armed men in black suits. As soon as they saw us they opened the doors revealing a luxurious spacious living room. The guard holding me shoved me inside and then the doors were closed.He was standing in front of a roaring fireplace his back to me. I stayed where I was not moving a muscle. I did not want to get closer to him. After a few minutes of silence he spoke. Laura come here to me.Why did you kidnap me Mr Torricelli I asked him quietly. I know it wasnt for money since my whole bank account is spare change to a man like yourself so why did you do itI told you to come here Laura. I dont like to repeat myself He replied a sharp edge to his voice that had not been there before. He slowly turned around to face me with a look of contemptuous anger on his face as he downed an amber liquid from a crystal tumbler he was holding. And I dont like to be kept waiting get your ass over here now babygirl or I promise you will regret it.I stared at him barely able to hide my shock when he suddenly threw his tumbler down onto the floor where it smashed into pieces. He stepped right into the broken shards of glass towards me a murderous expression on his face. That was when I ran over to him. Im here now Im here.Look what you made me do Laura He snapped his hands latching onto my arms tightly before he shook me like a ragdoll. His eyes were like dark pools full of pain and despair. They were also dilated hazy and red rimmed. I did not know if he was high or drunk but I was sure he was not sober. You bitch you made me like this. You wrecked me for other women.Mr Torricelli I gasped out fearfully after he stopped shaking me Im not Laura my name is He cut me off with a backhanded slap his gold signet ring causing my lip to split and bleed. He looked down at me and I thought I caught a flash of remorse in his dark eyes but soon it was gone without a trace . Your name is Laura when I want it to be do you understandI quickly nodded trying to hold back the tears that had sprung into my eyes when he had hit me. Please dont hurt me anymore.He sighed heavily giving me a disgusted look as he grabbed hold of my chin roughly. Youre really not like Laura. You dont have her fire. Maybe this was all a mistake. He whipped a silk handkerchief out of his suit lapel pocket and pressed it against my lip to stem the trickle of blood. Then he dropped the handkerchief onto the floor keeping my head tilted up towards him as he leaned closer. My heart dropped as I came to a chilling realization. If he thought he had made a mistake then he might kill me. He was not simply a powerful businessman but a criminal too. So I wrapped my arms around his neck and forcibly pushed my lips against his own with a yearning for him borne not of passion but desperation. I was only 22 I had barely lived my life and I was determined not to die yet. His stubble aggravated my cut lip but I persisted with my amateurish kiss. The first kiss I had shared with a man.His body stiffened and he did not return my kiss. I froze for a moment or two then carefully let go of him and stepped back. I stared at him with horror as his hands clenched into fists. I decided if he was going to attack me again then I could at least try to fight back. I quickly crouched down and snatched up a piece of the tumbler he had broken. Before I could stand up again he grabbed a fistful of my brown curls winding the long strands tightly around his fingers and yanking my neck back painfully as he knelt down next to me. Laura... He let out a deep bitter laugh as he rested his head against my shoulder. Laura why did you betray meI did not want to talk but if I stayed silent I was afraid he would lash out again. I dropped the glass and gingerly rested my hand on top of his head. Im sorry for everything that happened between us. I flinched when he suddenly locked his muscular arms around my waist but I was relieved that he had stopped pulling my hair.He pressed his face against the side of my face and inhaled. You dont smell like her.You smell good I replied after a short pause wary of what he would do if I broke character although he himself had finally acknowledged that I was not Laura. What do I usually smell like thenHe ignored me kissing my cheek as his hands rose up to cover my small breasts. I gasped when he squeezed them harshly but his grip soon loosened into a gentle teasing caress as his lips made a sensuous trail of kisses down my neck. I was very tense but I closed my eyes and pretended I was with an imaginary lover not an amorous criminal with deep relationship issues who did not care about me. I turned my head and he captured my lips in a hungry passionate kiss that made me completely forget my pretence. I felt sick as I returned his kiss but I also felt a sudden thrill shoot through my entire body. I felt a flush rise in my face as I felt the start of an arousal down low that sent tingling shocks through me and made my heart begin to race. I had never experienced it before not with a man at least although I was no stranger to masturbation. But when I masturbated it was very different. I was relying on my hand only to gratify myself and having a man touch me so intimately awoke something carnal in me that had not happened before when I touched myself.A heavy pounding was heard on the door which startled me. He pushed me away roughly then stood up and straightened his suit. Come in He called out as I quickly scrambled to my feet. I was ashamed of myself I knew it was not just for survival that I had allowed myself to be attracted to him.A man not much older than me came in who I had not seen before. He was wearing a suit too but not a black one and he did not have an earpiece like the guards did. He was handsome and had kind eyes. Massimo... The man shook his head slowly as he surveyed me. What did you do to the poor girlNothing she didnt deserve Massimo replied shortly. Now what do you want Domenico I still have a few things I need to say to her.Domenico headed over to us and reached out his hand with a sympathetic smile on his face. Its lovely to officially meet you.I hesitated looking at Massimo. Can I...He nodded slowly but after I smiled at Domenico and shook his hand Massimo gave me a fierce look that seared right through me. Just remember this doesnt give you a free pass to touch other men. I can count on one hand the number of people I trust and its your good fortune that Domenico is included in this number.Domenico patted Massimo on his shoulder and leant close to whisper something into his ear.Massimo shook his head. No no. I want to kill him personally.My eyes widened and I bit back the sound of shock that wanted to escape my mouth. I knew he was a hardened criminal but it was still frightening to hear him talk so casually about ending someones life.Lets talk about it later its not like hes going anywhere Domenico gave Massimo a look of reproach. I dont think this is a nice topic for a ladys ears or noMassimo smirked at me cruelly. If you had come in just a few moments earlier you would have seen with your own eyes that she is not a lady.Thats true I replied his words stinging me so deeply I could not help but bite back even if just a little. Because Im nothing to you but a toy. But you call yourself a man after what you did to me A real man doesnt hit a woman.But you said it yourself youre just a toy. Massimo grabbed me by the throat with one hand and squeezed until I was struggling to breathe properly. So I can do whatever the hell I want with you. Dont disrespect me in my own house Laura. I wont allow it. You understandI desperately nodded clutching at his wrist with both my hands in an attempt to ease the pressure. He let me go and I coughed before inhaling a deep breath and placing a trembling hand up to my throat.Apologize Laura. Massimo commanded me. Now.Im sorry for disrespecting you Mr Torricelli.Massimo call me Massimo. Massimo snapped at me. Go and sit by the fire while I talk to Domenico.I went to sit in an armchair close to the fireplace and stared into the orange and yellow flames. The warmth of the crackling fire was slightly comforting but also reminded me of the hell I was in now. Massimo made a good devil although I was no angel. I was just an ordinary woman who had got entangled in his snare. I wished I had never gone to deliver the orange juice but orders were orders as a maid and I was certain a man like Massimo would have easily found another way to capture me if that plan had failed. He might not have plans to kill me now but I did not know if that could change in the future. And I did not think he would just let me go if he grew tired of me. It was far easier to simply dispose of me.Laura Laura Massimo snapped his fingers impatiently. Pay attention to what I tell you now because its very serious. For you not for me He stepped closer and dashed a cream manila folder onto my lap. Look inside.I slowly opened up the folder and saw a few printed forms written in Italian as well as a bulletin dossier with the name and details of my last foster mother before I had aged out of the care system. There were also a few photos of her on a school run with some of the younger children she fostered. Why do you have these A feeling of sickness and fear washed over me in a devastating wave. Dont do anything to hurt her or the children. Theyre all innocents please... I pleaded fervently locking my eyes onto his own dark storm filled ones as I stood to my feet the manila folder slipping out of my hands. Ill do anything you want but please just stay away from them.Massimo pushed me back down onto the armchair and picked up the scattered contents of the manila folder. He threw the photos in the fire then sorted the papers before placing them on my lap and handing me a Parker pen. Sign your full name where its been marked with red tabs.What is this for I asked warily.Do you want Jane to live a healthy full life and enjoy her retirement Massimo shot back coolly his dark eyes glittering callously. Then dont ask questions and sign.I looked through the papers uselessly trying to translate the Italian to English. What made it worse was that certain words were blacked out with tape and I assumed they were cognate words that Massimo did not want me to guess the meaning of. Massimo crouched down by the side of the armchair and gave me an intimidating stare as I let the pen hover over the first red tab. Did you forget your own name Should I spell it out so you dont make a mistake I reluctantly signed my name where the red tabs indicated and each time I wrote my name I felt strange like I was a losing a part of myself. As soon as I had finished signing all the papers Massimo snatched them away from me and studied them intently before a brief smile appeared that made his eyes glow with a sudden happiness that was gone as soon as he looked at me again. You should be thankful I did not get you to formally change your name to hers.What I exclaimed loudly glaring at him fiercely. You were going to make me... I allowed my words to trail away into nothing my righteous anger draining as fast as it had come. Because there was no point arguing with him. After all a man like Massimo Torricelli usually got whatever his heart desired. Except for Laura a woman who was still such a mystery to me although we supposedly shared a similar appearance. I could not risk the safety of my foster mother or the children and at least he had not made me sign a name change form though it was still frightening to not know what I had signed. Can you promise me Jane and the children will be safeI would never hurt children Massimo glowered at me seeming disgusted by my assumption. And Jane will be fine as long as you be who I want you to be and dont try to escape from me. Not that you would get far if you tried to escape the island and then I would have to punish you.I did not say being with him was already a punishment although it was. But I was relieved that Massimo had morals enough not to hurt children. My practically empty stomach chose that moment to make grumbles of dissatisfaction. May I use your kitchenYoure hungry arent you Massimo eyed me knowingly before he crossed over to a phone picking it up he spoke a rapid burst of Italian and laughed before setting the phone down again. Two minutes later Domenico came in again although I had not noticed him leave the first time. Take her to our room put her in something pretty that will make the guards crave what they cant have then escort her to the back gardens. Youll join us for dinner. And send someone to deliver the paperwork to Ambrisoli. Domenico smiled sweetly as he held out his arm to me. Shall we goI nodded softly as I stood up not sparing Massimo a glance as I latched my hands around Domenicos arm although I could sense him staring at us. A naturally pretty plainly dressed maid with no makeup and dark brown hair in a tight bun was now in the room cleaning up the broken glass. She looked like she was only a few years older than me. I wanted to say sorry for the mess but settled for an apologetic look. The maid smiled at me but then quickly looked back down at the floor as if she was afraid of getting in trouble. And I could well imagine how afraid she might be with a boss like Massimo around. When we were almost at the doors Massimo called out to Domenico. And dont let her wear a bra. My head twisted back to look at him then and he blew me a mocking kiss. See you soon babygirl.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/49123000,A madrigal's album,Attleboro Massachusetts It was a peaceful morning in the Cahill Mansion well not too peaceful. Dan had made a canon using fireworks as a prank it was hidden just in the backyard of the mansion. Ready asked Dan as he looked at Atticus who was going to light their handmade canon up. Ready Crack BOOM Amy who was inside the mansion flinched and immediately hid. Considering from past experiences explosives were always not a good sign. After the fireworks died down Amy rushed to their backyard and bumping into Uncle Fiske in the process. DAN she yelled her eyes setting to the two boys giggling behind a rose bush. THAT WASNT FUNNY BY THE WAY she added. Whats going on What happened Uncle Fiske asked looking at Amy then to Dan and Atticus. The dweeb blew the remaining fireworks up. replied Amy in an angry yet tired tone. Uncle Fiske sighed. Can you guys please just behave Alistair is coming for an important meeting today. he said adjusting the hem of his black sweater. Uncle Alistair is visiting asked Amy Dan perked up. Isnt he like busy or something asked Dan as him and Atticus stood up and walked towards Amy and Uncle Fiske. Not really but this is something important for the both of us. replied Uncle Fiske. What is it anyways I mean if it makes Uncle Alistair visit so suddenly it must be important. Amy added raising an eyebrow at her greatuncle. Its someone important. replied Fiske Oohhh really Who is it Is it Uncle Alistairs lover or yours asked Dan excited. No dear boy. Uncle Fiske softly laughed It was our friend another Cahill in the Madrigal branch. he added. With a little bit of Tomas blood. a voice popped up. Deep and silky Thats surely familiar. Alistair youre here. greeted Uncle Fiske smiling brightly at his cousin. Yes and just on time no one answered the door so I invited myself in. replied Alistair with a light shrug. How did the security system not catch you.. Dan trailed off Alistair gave the boy an innocent smile followed with a cartoonish wink. And besides me and Fiske never considered love important. said Alistair. Not really I do truly regret not having children. replied Fiske before Alistair gave his shoulder a soft pat. Awhh thats sad Amy was cut off by Dan. Whos this Madrigal friend he asked Was he cool Did he know kung fu Or or did he excel both of your skills I think its rather best to tell her story inside. said Alistair as he gave them a slight nod and walked back inside with them following. Wait its a her You guys actually befriended a woman Dan asked but it was more of an insult. Living room Cahill Mansion I found this book somehow it didnt burn like the others. said Fiske putting a thick book with a hard red cover in the coffee table. Daniis album. Wait a minute Uncle Fiske. You said it was a girl isnt Danii a guy name asked Dan. Actually Dan Danii is both its basically a unisex name. Atticus corrected Dan. Danii Yvonne Cahill thats her full name. said Fiske. Thats a real fancy name. Dont tell me she acts like those bratty Cobras. Dan scoffed. She is quite the opposite. replied Alistair Danii hates Lucians actually. Fiske added. Respect but still super suspicious. Dan nodded. Was she a good person Uncle Fiske asked Amy. Of course she is but Fiske was the nicest out of our trio. Alistair chuckled. This is where she stored our photos from our mission before our last adventure together. said Fiske sitting down with the others. Fiske lifted the from cover it was signed. I actually made an image but I dont know how to insert it How old is this album Uncle Fiske asked Amy. If my calculations are correct that could be like a decade ago. replied Atticus. More than four decades actually this was back then at the 60s to 70s. Alistair corrected. Woah its pretty well kept for something in the 60s. Atticus marvelled. Lets see here Uncle Fiske placed the album in his lap and scaled the pictures,General Audiences,Not Found
https://archiveofourown.org/works/47491063,Catastrophe Strikes In the Bermuda Triangle,Amy Cahill loved mornings waking up at the crack of dawn to stare out the windows of the rebuilt mansion petting Saladin gingerly behind the ears. She however was not too excited to have the relatives of the entire younger generation mercy of Alistair Oh and Fiske Cahill whod also be attending. Amy did not want to listen to the Kabra kids say something with a stick up their ass or the Holts yell and make threats the Starlings argue or flex their knowledge well easy on Ted for that. The arguing and flexing were mostly Ned and Sinead thank whatever is in the sky they sent a good triplet with a sense of dignity and manners.Still she readied herself. Slipping on a smoky blue cable knit Vneck sweater some blue jeans and her watch with Gideons ring Amy set off to Dans room just to be sure he wasnt sleeping in. When she opened his door low and behold he was sleeping away on his bed.Dan Everyone will be getting here soon hurry it up She yelled at him throwing open his curtains as she entered the room. He stirred and groaned using his arm to cover his eyes. She could see a halfeaten pack of oreos on his nightstand of course he had been up late eating which is why he was so tired. Ignoring his pleads of five more minutes or make them wait longer she ripped his blanket off him and balled it up using an elastic band to tie it together. She launched it onto the ceiling perfectly landing it on a hanging light.If you want to go to sleep so badly go get it. She said as she turned down the temperature on his air conditioning. Never had he learned to use it and she heard him groan and yell at her as she shut his door behind her and exited the air conditioner whirring.Amy walked downstairs expecting her guests to take at least another half hour to arrive when she suddenly received a call from Sinead.Hey Sorry not Sinead its Ned but Sinead ran into a bit of a.. problem. Well still get there on time but dont be surprised when you see her. Oh yeah she told me to call you and ask if were leaving tomorrow or the day after she forgot. Ned spoke through Sineads phone and although it had caught her off guard the first time she was quite concerned at Neds statement.Alright then we leave tomorrow but to make transportation easier everyone is staying at our house tonight. Everyone is coming for the meet then leaving to do what they need to since its only the early morning and around six or seven everyone is coming back. Amy told Ned who thanked her and hung up. He was most definitely the most energetic and ecstatic out of the three aside from whenever his head was bothering him too much. Ted who as practically Neds other half was usually quiet by choice of course. He usually got distracted easily in his own thoughts but whenever Ned needed someone to cover him during a headache Ted gladly stepped up and kept a conversation going.Amy shuffled to the kitchen and started boiling water for tea. Shed make herself some ginger tea and once her guests arrived shed end up making more tea and some coffee mostly for the Holts since they didnt drink tea or rarely did at least. Once it was prepared shed begin drinking as Dan waltzed himself down the stairs dressed in dark blue jeans and a black shirt spared by a dark green hoodie. He looked in short lazy. Wow way to go supermodel. Amy picked at him he rolled his eyes and muttered a shut up before wandering to the pan of boiled water as he began to make himself some hot chocolate. Yes Dan uses water to make hot chocolate yes the rest of the Cahills are not proud of it.So what time are the killer machines getting here Cannot wait to see the pythons again and the moons and the bolts and the alakazam and alakazoo. Dan spat his array of nicknames for each family rolling off with ease he barely needed to practice reciting all these nicknames. The pythons the Kabras just a different type of snake close to Cobra. The moons the Starlings. He got so original and took Star and thought of moon he calls Sinead the blood moon Ned the cheese moon and Ted the blue moon. The bolts the Holts it was so unrulily lame it just rhymed with Holts. The Alakawhatever The Wizards he thought of wizards casting spells and whatnot alakazam was Jonah and alakazoo was Phoenix. Those nicknames are so ridiculous and you just got lazy with the Holts. Sloppy with the Kabras and uninspired with the Starlings the only slightly funny one was the Wizards. She spat back sitting on the counter as she sipped her ginger tea.Hey the Starling one may be uninspired but the single moon types are true. Sineads always so fiery and piercing blood moon Ned is energetic and pepful cheese moon and Ted is shunning and... well sometimes cold blue moon. He said although she was not impressed with the names she knew he wasnt exactly wrong. She did feel tempted to tell him a cheese moon did not exist however.Within ten minutes a heavy loud knock emerged on the front door. Once Amy was just a foot away from the door the same heavy knocking emerged once again through the door she could hear talking.It is so ungodly hot out here Madison yelled as Hamilton hammered on the door through the peephole she saw the group of children as well as Alistair and Fiske The Kabras were lingering in the back behind the adults the Holts the Wizards and the Starlings most of them. Ted was in the back too Flamsteed at his feet. Uncle Alistair had offered to watch the dog while they were away since itd be for a year and Flamdsteed did need someone to take care of him. She flung the door open and was almost hit in the face by Hamiltons huge hand as he was still hammering on the door she dodged unfortunately Dan was not so lucky.Ham bro What the hell Dan yelled cupping his red cheek. Dude I was knocking I didnt know she would open the door I am so sorry buddy He assured and apologized Sinead rolled her eyes.You could hear their footsteps you didnt have to keep knocking more than once Sinead yelled at him Hamilton went from apologetic to slightly annoyed.I cant hear everything Im not Ted He argued back Ted finally looked up from petting Flamsteed looking or I guess not looking at the two.Leave me out of this. He stated back coldly waving a hand at the two.Alright Children enter please Alistair called to them as Amy turned around to lead them inside she saw Ted inside talking to Dan Flamsteed in between them as Dan pet the dog excitedly.Ted Howd you get in here you were just outside Amy called to him he turned at her and sighed not an annoyed huff just a confused and understanding breath.You guys just need to pay more attention to your surroundings. He told her with a shrug Ian quietly snickered.Ian shut it. Natalie snapped back she seemed to be in her normal demeanor at least. Or maybe she didnt appreciate her brother snickering at the one sane person left in the family.Amy led everyone to their living room Alistair began to set up something on his laptop as everyone sat in separate spots. Natalie and Ian on a coach Ned and Ted on the one right next to them. Natalie and Ted were sitting on either side of the couch so they were barely two feet from one another. The Holt kid girls sat on a loveseat together Hamilton Jonah and Phoenix sat on a longer couch. Fiske Sinead Amy Dan and Alistair all sat one the final couch. Alistair soon stood up and he clapped a small beat.Yo are you starting a duet Ill be baritone if you are. Jonah asked Alistair shook his head.Not at all dear child watch. He told the group as the TV earlier off began to turn on. A robotic face appeared on the screen with a text bar at the bottom. It began to speak.Good evening Cahills It appears I have been started by Oh Alistair. How may I be of service to you The robotic screen asked in its robotic voice. The subtitles at the bottom displayed what the robot were saying.Nice touch the subtitles yes Alistair asked Ted rolled his eyes in a half joking half serious manner.Useful for you guys. He said his tone indicating it was meant to be a joke yet the nature of his joke seemed to strike as he was not fully joking.Cahillian please direct us to Character Files C.C.F please pull up a B.TE.S tab on another file and direct us to our randomizer. He spoke into the computer it lit up to another color from white to green indicating it listened. A file appeared on screen it had a list of names which were followed by the grades reports credit bills and even felonies done by each child of the family. It truly had a list of all personal intel. Uncle Alstair what does B.TE.S and C.C.F mean Sinead back innocently. He knew shed be asking in case she or her brothers ever needed to open the program themselves. Dear child B.TE.S means Bermuda Traingle Ekaterina Stronghold. C.C.F means Cahill Children Files. If you ever need to open the program to your own accord just ask. He answered she almost scoffed at him knowing what she wanted but she suddenly turned her attention to the screen where Hamiltons list of crimes were shown.Hamilton when did you evade a group of officers Sinead asked him in a question he saw his name displayed with his crime list seventeen charges of varying crimes.When did you rob a grave He asked back as it shifted to her list three counts of grave robbing twenty one counts of other crimes.Ian really Public indecency Dan asked.Wow Ned four counts of illegal weaponry Asked Reagan a concerning list struck the screen next.Theodore thirteen counts of scamming nine counts of smuggling machinery parts.. when did you even have time to evade an officer Natalie asked his list wasnt the longest surely but he had the second most crime count next to Amy. He was even beating Dan somehow.Youre one to talk vandalism and trespassing Illegal poison access Detonating a bomb in the presence of a S.W.A.T member He fired back she looked away with a following snarky remark I forgot geniuss were sometimes stupid enough to be caught smuggling. She spat a smug smirk threatening to cross her face. I love being insulted by a vandalistic and a litterer Ill have to get you for those jaywalking crimes eight counts Natalie shame on you. He fired back she scoffed jokingly Ian nudged her with a what the hell was that expression. He leaned over and whispered to her rapid whispering came from between the two and the only thing Amy could make out was You never laugh at anyone this is obscene NatalieBut seriously when did you evade a group of officers Ian asked leaning out from huis whispering with Natalie Ted and Hamilton made prolonged eye contact and Ted shook his head mouthing a do not.Well Cahillian direct us to the randomizer. We are all headed to the Bermuda Triangle in two days time wed like you to assist us in dormitory selection. Alistair instructed the system who pulled a name randomizer up.First match.. Rosenbloom Atticus and Holt Madison. The machine said the two looked at each other and although Hamilton seemed ready to bound into protective brother mode they just shrugged it off.Second match... Kabra Ian and Cahill Dan. The machine rang out they both groaned in annoyance and after Amy and Natalie had to shut them up the machine went on.Third match Starling Ned and Holt Reagan. It said in its monotone voice at this point Ian seemed fed up.Alistair is this a random pairing or are you playing matchmaker Ian asked clearly annoyed and pissed.If this is matchmaker I would like to revoke my name please. Natalie asked Alistair shook his head.This is all randomized apologies if the pairings are strange. He said continuing on to the next.Fourth pairing Cahill Amy and Starling Sinead. It said the two girls cheered and high fived from their close spots.Fifth pairing Starling Ted and Kabra Natalie. It rang Ian shot a dagger stare at Ted while Sinead glared down Ian and Natalie.God just kill me now. Ted moaned in aggravation he threw his head back in exaggerated misery as Natalie groaned.Take me too this is torture. She sighed in agony.I was right this is just matchmaker. Do anything uncouth Ted and Ill hav Ian started.If I do anything uncouth Ill take my own head off and give it you out of shame. He spat before Ian could finish the threat.Sixth pairing Wizard Jonah and Holt Hamilton. It rang the two were obviously excited by Phoenix seemed nervous.Seventh and last pairing Wizard Phoenix and Rosenbloom Jake. The machine said. It was done finally but everyone was rather unhappy except for Amy and Sinead as well as Jonah and Hamilton.No way uncle Alistair can I please switch rooms with anyone anyone Dan asked he smirked and nodded.Yes you can ask Ted to trade if not youre stuck. He told Dan Ted looked up at the mention of his name Natalie looked disgusted.Now way sorry Daniel but if I have to pick between you and Theodore I pick him. Natalie mentioned. Ted seemed to see this as a perfect moment to speak. Really I mean really he asked she nodded. I have people Id pick over you but youre smarter than Daniel more hygienic certainly less disgusting you arent nearly as messy you may actually be the cleanest boy here rather than Ian of course. She said although they all sounded like insults to everyone else Teds face almost achieved a pinkish color as he turned away Ned suppressing a giggle.Yeah sorry Dan. Either way Im stuck with a Kabra and call me crazy but Natalie is probably more tolerable than Ian. Ted said back to Dan turning back after cooling his face down.So children Alistair began eyeing Natalie in specifics. There is no need to overpack at all the Triangle has wonderful stores on all three islands there is no need to pack more than necessary. That being said your roommate is also your travel mate for any part where you need to leave a chaperoned area to go elsewhere you must go only with your partner you may leave with other people but if your travel mate is not there there will be consequences in place.I have to go everywhere with Ian This will be torture Dan cried for a moment Dan looked at Ted and Natalie who were near one another based on their earlier arrangements. Actually never mind. Looking at Ted I feel I made a good decision not swapping. Feel bad for you bud. He said with a laugh.Cant help feeling bad either I mean Reagan wont drag me random and obscure places... right Ned asked looking at Reagan who was snickering.I might do that now just to spite you lots and lots of gym time thats for sure.Children if you please the Bermuda Triangle is a dangerous source of place if you are not careful. The worst that can happen is incredibly incredibly painful deaths. It is so important you stick together in case one of you dies or almost do. He told the group who at the mention of more possibilities of dying are not seen to be sure if they should be scared or feel nothing.We get sent to risk our lives again what a shocker this is. Ned said his tone a mix of annoyance and joking.Yes yes I know. Risking your lives once again is not fun but this is important. All your parents have gone through this your grandparents your aunts uncles elder cousins everyone went through this. It has been an Ekat tradition for hundreds of years. He spoke some sort of grave tone infiltrating his voice. So my fellow Ekats Sinead Ned and Ted you three may find out important pieces of history about our branch that you do not know yet. He told the Starling kids who all looked around at one another. After more information was told amongst the group everyone left the house to do whatever the hell they needed to do that day and pack for the year long trip to the Bermuda Triangle. . . . Yo my homeys Jonah yelled as he walked into Amy and Dans mansion for the second time that day. Everyone else trailing behind them with luggage and whatnot. Natalie bearing minimal luggage as Ian carried half of hers plus his own.Ian you need a hand with that Hamilton asked from somewhere behind him Ian accepted the help and passed the rest of Natalies stuff to Hamilton. The guests bedrooms were all located on the second or third floor they divvied up whod be sleeping where based on dormitory arrangements for the triangle. Dan and Amy slept in their respective rooms on the second and third floors Teds room had been he direct room to Amys right and she was relived he most likely wouldnt be keeping her awake all night.While everyone was settling down for bed she decided to indulge in Ted and go ask him some questions check up on him the usual. She gently knocked on his door and within a few moments he opened the door. His freckles were more noticeable now that it was near sunset and the room was still very very nicely kept except his laptop being on the bed.Hey Ted I was getting ready to head to the kitchen and make some tea would you like to come with She asked she wasnt sure if it sounded like it but to her her tone sounded too abrasive she hoped he didnt think she was trying to intimidate him. He accepted and slipped on a sweater before following her out of his room. Amy noticed she was 58 and he was around her height if she were correct he was the same height as her unlike Ned who was a good 510. The Starlings were known for being tall but not freakishly tall like the Holts an attractive slender type tall. And yes Ted certainly was tall but he was the shortest out of the triplets.When they arrived in the kitchen he said something that shocked Amy. You want to talk to me about something right If this is something you want to discuss over tea I assume its important would you like me to help you in making it He asked her she told him that she invited him to come walk with her and that she could make them both tea. Luckily for Amy Ted was not picky at all.I was thinking She said calmly passing him a mug of chamomile tea which she had decided would be best for them both Its such a lovely and warm night do you want to drink this on the porch with me She asked he nodded happily before snapping two fingers together in a rapid motion. Soon a dog came into the kitchen Ted placed his cup on the counter somehow and scratched behind Flamsteeds ears.Only if we can take Flamsteed with us. He said as a half joke but what kind of family leader and amazing cousin would she be if she didnt let Teds dog come with them Besides he needed the exercise.Of course he can come Flamsteed has to be my favorite dog Ive ever met hes so sweet Amy rubbed Flamsteeds back as the two grabbed their mugs and headed out together Flamsteed sticking close to Teds legs and guiding him outside even though he could navigate on his own now. Outside there was a swing with a small glass table in front of it the two sat down as Flamsteed ran around the yard chasing after a squirrel or something.So youre rooming with Natalie eh How do you feel about that She asked trying desperately to start a conversation with him. He was known for being one of the quieter members of the family which is why he got along with Phoenix and Atticus so well even though Atticus was not blood family.Well Im not sure how I feel about it. On one hand there are people Id prefer like Sinead or Ned Id probably room with Phoenix if needed and Jonahs a good friend but shes not terrible. She can definitely be a handful at times and sometimes she can be a nasty horrible malicious scheming self centered liar He stopped taking in a sharp breath as he collected his thoughts fully. But she is funny and she certainly isnt boring. Shes.. I dont know who to explain it shes.. not as bad as everyone makes her out to be yknow In my opinion every time I try comparing everyone elses adaptations of her to my own she seems so mischaracterized. Like all the terrible stuff shes done when thinking about it it feels so hard to actually connect her to what shes done. He spoke with an uncertainly overwhelming in his voice. But even with the falter of his tone and his pausing his words touched a nerve in Amy like Ted had been a wakeup call for how shes been acting.I.. I get that now that I think of it we have been too judgmental of her.. Natalie isnt terrible it was her mother.. She said to him while she meant to tell him she was also informing herself trying to awaken herself out of this thought process she had going for so long.Yeah Natalie isnt too bad Ive always tried to be patient with the Kabras especially her sometimes that can be hard but you always have to remember who and where they came from. It wasnt easy being them Id assume and with their parents and relatives breathing down their necks it must be hard. Sometimes people need to be more patient and attentive with people like Natalie and Ian or else all they do is destroy their own perspective on the kids and their own confidence. Ted finished his voice transferring from its original wavering tone to a consecutive firm and understanding tone.Amys silence followed as she watched Flamsteed zoom through the yard the flowers scattered around the yard swaying with the evening wind the tall grass blowing softly and the leaves on the trees swayed with the crisp summer air. Ted was right he always was. Amy knew he was right. when was he not She glanced at his face as he stared off into nothing even with his blindness his eyes seemed to shine as he explained what he saw in Natalie and Amy could almost feel like she saw all the processing in his head. As he thought about this mischaracterized girl his eyes seemed to sparkle more almost like you could see every heartbeat every breath of air every pump of blood his eyes were not dead they were lively more living than Amy felt Natalie knew that he was correct too the porch wrapped around the house and on the wall next to the swing Natalie stood listening and attentive. Her pen with an audio recorder out she wielded it like a sword but even with the audio proof she couldnt believe what she heard. Someone noticed how she felt someone really noticed.And it was the stupid stupid Starling boy. Hello this will be an ongoing story but I will need to post this chapter now and the rest later.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/44199565,amends,Amy Jonah Ham Ian uh I think were all here. I exhale. Um. Hi everyone.Sinead loops her arm around my shoulder reassuringly directing an almost imperceptible nod in the general direction of the camera. A silent vote of confidence.A shaky laugh escapes my lips. Well uh. This is awkward.Sinead shakes her head animatedly rolling her eyes. I duck my head below the camera lens to shoot her a deathstare. Not helping I mouth silently.Project confidence. Weve been over this. She smirks. Remember the spaghetti incident.I plough on biting back a smile. My apologies everyone. Connectivity error.Natalie snorts.The past couple of months havent been easy for most any of you. Youve all lost people close to you had to reconsider your principles reevaluate your entire belief system everything you thought you knew about yourselves. Your identity. We I cant thank you enough. Ever.I briskly scan their faces before continuing. You chose us over everything and theres no way that choice was easy. Theres no way its ever going to be easy but thats okay.Wheres Dan Reagan pipes up. Sinead shoots me a thumbsup and an encouraging smile.Uh Dan...is...hell be here. Anytime now. Hes just Sinead quirks her eyebrows at me questioningly. I gesture for her to bring me a writing pad.Havent we been over all of this Natalie interjects. Amelia Im not going to pretend leaving Mom was easy. Its the hardest decision Ian and I have ever had to make and we know that better than anybody else here. So do these...people for their respective...families. Do not make me regret choosing you every time I have to listen to your whiny shrieky little voice owI apologize for the little brat I have no choice but to call my sister Amy. Ians distinctive silky voice cuts through the speakers. We appreciate your concern. Please proceed.Im not sure if its just nerves or the unhealthy amount of coffee I downed this morning but Ian seems uncharacteristically tired. His voice is missing the brisk edge thats plagued my nightmares and consumed my daydreams far too many times for me to forget any time soon and he seems significantly less irritable than he usually is today. In fact this is the first time hes opened his mouth since we commenced the session.Sinead pokes at my arm shoving the pad into my chest. Dans recruiting I scrawl messily onto the paper pushing it back to her.She raises her eyebrows.I grab the pad back from her. Was supposed to hold a video conference yesterday but my nerves were acting up. Dans better at this stuff.What about these guys She gestures to my laptop screen.I shrug. Thought it was better to give them a quick headsup beforehand. They dont know about this yet. Tell you later....AmyRight. Sorry. I bite my lip.Ian are you...okay I blurt out before I can stop myself. WHY WHY DID I HAVE TO ASK THAT JUST THEN Perfect timing Amy. As always. I despise my brain.I want to kill myself right now. Right this very second. If I dont die within the next few minutes from the ensuing embarrassment that is. Why. Whywhywhywhywhy. Ian jaw tenses. He seems justifiably taken aback.Couldnt be better Amy he sighs.And then he...smilesIts an exhausted smile sure...but its a smile nonetheless.A rush of adrenaline courses through my veins. I did it. I actually accomplished something with this hellish conference I got someone to smile.Maybe I can do this after all.Amy Amy. Earth to Amy Hams waving a fist at the camera.Oh. Right. I catch the slightest hint of a smile playing on Ians lips from the corner of my eye. Natalie jabs him in the ribs and he sobers up at once.So...what is it SineadSineads frantically waving the pad at me smirking. Get a room.I snatch the cursed thing from her. For the last time. Ian and I are very close platonic friends and not romantically involved or even attracted to each other in any way. Please keep any voyeuristic sexual fantasies concerning the two of us to yourself or better still get a room of your own.Sinead collapses on the floor giggling unable to restrain herself any longer. Jeez.PLATONIC. BUDS. I underline both words twice for emphasis and toss the pad across the room at her.Whats going on with the two of you up thereI tuck a strand of reddishbrown hair behind my ear and stare squarely at the camera. Im really sorry everyone. Im new to all this stuff. Public speaking and... I swallow. Uh...I was...Sinead and I were thinking...Sinead tosses a pen cap at me. When I glance back shes holding the pad up. GET TO THE FREAKING POINT GIRL I roll my eyes at her. Again not helping I mouth. Youre ruining my flow.Cahill Trivia Night Sinead yells out from across the room.I no If looks could kill Sinead would be six feet under. I lower my voice to a hiss.Youre my closest girlfriend but Im not letting you get away with this.The insolent creature has the nerve to gesture to the pad not even bothering to dignify me with a verbal response. Aww Im sorry but a girls gotta do what a girls gotta doAt this Jonah stands up abruptly. A loud crash sounds in the background. I second that. No offence Amy but itll get everyone to bond yeah Its better than having to listen to you make the speech for theJonah. Hamiltons voice is unnaturally sharp. You were doing great Amy but uh I think we should give this a shot. Twould could be fun. He fidgets uncomfortably. Are you sure my bro Dan will be here soonHot tears begin to prickle up against my lashes and I bite my lip as hard as I can to help restrain them. I cant cry not here not now. Im just being overly sensitive...right Honesty is good. I want them to be honest with me and if this is what they really wantDan. They all want Dan. And who can blame them My little brother is exponentially better than me at everything I just wish I could do something anything to helpSinead rushes to my side and grabs me roughly by the shoulder. I feel my legs drag me across the room following her lead without my consent.Amy. Amy.Amy did you take your meds this morningI yes. Obviously.Amy you need to listen to me. Her grip on my wrists feels uncomfortably tight.Could youOh. Yeah. Im sorry. She lets go of my wrists. For everything I didnt mean for any of that to happen Ames you do realize this isnt your fault rightI know it isnt my fault. Dan Sinead my therapist Grace before them...theyve all reminded me to avoid blaming myself approximately a zillion times. Its my cursed anxiety. None of this is my fault.Its just...I cant help it. Ive messed everything up.I understand how my anxiety is supposed to work in theory. I understand that its making me feel this way. Ever since Grace helped me realize it was a capitalP Problem something Id need to address actively Ive been trying to work on it reading up on anything and everything even remotely related taking my medication regularly pushing myself to interact more socially if only within my comfort zone...Its just so gosh darn hard. I feel like Im wired to mess everything up and there are only so many free passes my anxiety can fetch me right Im human and I have to claim accountability for my mistakes just like everyone else. I could help prevent this. By preparing more perhaps or talking things through with Sinead...Grace. Grace wouldve helped me work through this had she been alive. My brilliant beautiful grandmother. The brave caring woman who always always understood...I take a deep breath and steady myself.Sinead extends her palms to me. You can hold them. Its okay if theyre sweaty.I feel my lips twitch as she tentatively pulls me into a hug.Is this okayA soft hoarse whisper against my ear as her lips graze my hair.I...think so. Yes I manage. More than okay Sinead.Mm. Thats good. She doesnt say anything for a few seconds and we elapse into a comfortable silence.Then This is all...yours. She exhales stroking my hair ever so lightly with her fingers. All this responsibility. This decision this choice this fight. Its yours and I know youll figure it all out given time because you always do. Youve... She chokes out a laugh. Youve made it through so much Amy. Isabel the clue hunt the gauntlet... She gesticulates with her left hand as she speaks shes still running the fingers of her right hand through my hair. You succeeded at something people have been trying and failing to accomplish for five hundred years.Where are you going with thisThis is just a video conference. Youve survived all the nittygritty nigh impossible parts of this. I know your relationship with your cousins feels extremely fragile and...and delicate right now but youll navigate this fine. She snickers suddenly. I assure you theyll give you all the time you need. Its not like they have a choice.I narrow my eyes at her. My best friend desperately needs to work on her discretion.Amy...there isnt much I can do as your friend beyond reminding you of everything youre capable of every so often because again this is all yours. Theres only so much I or anyone else can do to help with it. And youre capable of a lot. Just...know that if you ever need a shoulder to lean on Im always there kayYoure such a clich√©.Do not reduce me to your 90s romcom marginalized sidekick Amy Cahill.But...youre notShe brushes me aside. You get what I mean. I have my own life and my own goals and the fact that were best friends doesnt mean were obligated to define each others paths in life. However...Ill always be there to help you figure it out nudge you along if you will...if you ever happen to need me. For moral support.I slowly pull away from her looking her directly in her soft yet somehow unnervingly intense coffeebrown eyes. My hands are firmly clasped in hers. Sinead...You want to go back in there....thank you.Huh. Were good. She pats me awkwardly on the head. So...you ready to get back in thereCan you talk to them for a bit I think I still I still need another minute if thats okay.Definitely. Sure. She presses a light kiss onto my cheek and bounces back into the conference room her sleek strawberryblonde ponytail glinting in the neon lights of the hallway behind her. Whenever youre ready kay... Ian Everybody calm the fuck downNatalie starts at my admittedly fairly uncharacteristic Mum always thought cursing to be unbecoming of a young cultured gentleman like myself use of profanity but quickly regains herself. Maybe you should consider calming down yourself darling. She shrugs. DecafNo thanks. I raise my voice. Amy suggested trivia so trivia it is.Who died and I swiftly tap on a series of buttons across my screen blocking the cretin out. A notification promptly pops up on my screen You have successfully removed The Wiz from this video conference. If you are the host you can always add them back via the Profiling Menu. Hey the burly Neanderthal protests. This isnt a dictatorship were running here. You arent evenImplementing threats to enforce discipline Natalie quotes although technically speaking there wasnt one in the first place. Nice.Thank you sis.SisI dont know who I am anymore I shrug. Ive been trying on different personas since...yknow. Experimenting. Hopefully something will click and Ill...Yknow Natalie interrupts. Ian. Go through a hundred experimental teenage phases or even an alarmingly predue midlife crisis for all I care but at least retain some form of dignity. She shakes her head disapprovingly. And never forget your roots.I arc a brow.Natalie sighs. You know what I mean. Id never be able to stand it if you became one of...them.You have nothing to worry about I assure her.Is anybody adding my homie back the dolt booms. This is supposed to be a democracy.I roll my eyes. Your homie was Agetting on my last nerve and Bguilty of gross misconduct that more than qualified him for immediate and abject banishment from the video conference.Challenging you.Honey I know its difficult for you to communicate in nonbinary sentences but simply commanding yourself to do whatever it is youre hoping to accomplish through quadrisyllable sentences wont get the job done Natalie simpers saccharinely.I was merely confirming what apparently qualifies as gross misconduct as per your almost pathetically malnourished brothers standards the buffoon manages to spit out through clenched teeth. Standing up to himI have to admit the nitwit catches me offguard for a second there. I did not expect him to defend his socially uncouth...pal Acquaintance If Im being honest I have no idea how close the two have grown since the end of the hunt. Theyre a lot chummier than I remember them ever being. If I take this glorious new honesty to the next level Im not sure how I feel about that.Anyway I did not expect him to stand up to me in a verbal argument. As any Lucian will confirm a verbal argument to a Kabra is nothing less than a sacred battle a battle of wits usually with an unarmed opponent with infinite potential for growth. This is taking into consideration the fact that any poor soul with half a brain will generally have enough sense to avoid partaking in such a suicidal endeavour of course.I choose to ignore him. We will be dividing into teams based off of our family branches and will each then get the chance to choose one question for every other team.An annoyingly disruptive ping interrupts my flow. Its another blasted notification. Da Holtz hamburgerz4life added The Wiz to this meeting. I want to swear.How pray tell did you manage to do that I inquire through clenched teeth instead. A respectable Lucian always concedes when he knows hes about to encounter defeat.Ham my man Hammy my homie. Thanks yo.The nincompoop actually blushes at that. Amy Cahill would be proud.Anytime bro.I do not like being dismissed.AhemFo real though how did you pull that off yo I thought only Amy could do that.The twit turns a brilliant shade of burgundy.I clear my throat. Well Amy isnt here soNot many people know this but theres a tiny loophole in the programming of most systems that can allow anyone to access the controls. Sinead probably left it there on purpose in this case sort of as an escape route a backup in case of emergencies yknow Anyway its pretty easy to catch once you know about it he babbles. Then a tad nervously biting his lip I can show you later if you want me toHoly hell. Am I sensing...a celebrity crushSure thing dawg. Thatd be fly. Jonah flashes the camera his famous allstar smile. Where did you pick all of this upCoding classes Hamilton replies shyly. Ive been taking them since sophomore year without telling my dad but this is pretty basic stuff. Youll pick it up in no time. He cracks his knuckles awkwardly. I uh came clean to him after the hunt.Jonahs smile fades a little at that but he brightens up again almost immediately. Thats awesome yo. So hes cool with itHes...warming up to it. He shrugs. Hell come around eventually. Thats my dad for you.I have to fight to hold back the snide retort thats already built its way up to the tip of my tongue.Apparently even the idiot senses hes overstepped because he quickly backtracks. Er...Im really sorry. I didnt meanYoure good Jonah interjects. You dont have to censor yourself just because the rest of us have shitty parents. I love my dad too. Nothing to be ashamed of.I want to gag myself. Where is Daniel when you need himI...uh yeah no I get it. I shouldnt be rubbing it in your faces.Cmon man Loosen up. Jonah pushes up his sunglasses why would you wear those indoors Why would you wear them during the winter at all chuckling a little. So...how bout we meet up at your place for one of those coding classes sometimeI swear to actual God.Er...yeah Yeah hows Friday evening for youIts a date. Jonah grins.An awkward silence ensues.Dear God. Natalies playing with her sleek glossy hair twisting it into an elaborate knot of tiny braids that forms a halo over her head. I think she was going for cornrows but I have to admit the mess thats her latest hairdo looks inexplicably gorgeous on her as almost everything does. She has a knack for this stuff. People assume that personal style is just about costly products from Gucci and fancy dresses from Prada but to my sister its practically a window to the soul. She emulates other people to find herself inculcating the parts that feel like her into her style and tweaking the ones that feel uncomfortable or alien which to her practically defines her identity. Her sense of self.My point is my sisters obsession with anything and everything even vaguely fashionrelated is more like her one true passion in life not taking deception into account. Its what she truly cares about. Shes not half as shallow or superficial as people tend to assume she is. The sexual tension is killing me. Make out already. So the rest of us can move on.I aim a swift kick at my sisters shin.WhatHamilton ducks his head peering at Jonah through the corner of his eye. The young hip hop stars unusually quiet but I can almost feel the waves of tension hes practically radiating through the screen.Natalie I hiss under my breath. Discretion.Hey guys. Sinead Starlings breathless voice breaks through the heavy veil of tension. Amys taking care of some stuff Saladin just had a bit of an...um episode the poor things been sick all morning. I dont think its too serious though just an ordinary bout of theAhem I cut in. I feel like Im about to puke. Is Amy okayEveryone predictably bursts into a fit of cackling.I loathe Daniel Arthur Cahill.Im fine Amy retorts....AmesIts all good Sinead. I just needed a second to...regroup. Ian I promise Im fine....regroup Natalie echoes. Right.Whatd I miss She seems a little flustered.Hamilton and Jonah Natalie begins.Ganged up against me for trying to maintain some semblance of order I finish. It was all chaos without you here. Youre the only one who can handle this Amy.She looks up gratefully. RreallyI scoff. You think Id admit that willinglyThanks Ian. Really. That means a lot coming from you.Amy I dont know how to say this. I dont think itd go over well with anyone.But Im so...damn...exhausted.Its everything. Booking the plane tickets to Massachusetts having to deal with the temper tantrum Nats inevitably going to throw when she finds out were flying economy figuring out temporary lodging arrangements for the two of us trying to find a good longterm investment plan handling all the messy legal issues from the disownment Mum reworking the art dealershipI havent slept a good six hours in weeks and Im barely functioning on three at the moment.Can we can we resume this meeting tomorrow I plead. Im really sorry but I just have so much I need to I have a tournament the dolt adds. And an assignment that counts for 39 of my grade thats due on Friday.I have popup books to sign.Amy looks crestfallen. I thats okay but...Ill be asking everyone to join tomorrow. Dan Nellie AlistairPlease do. We need something to balance the insanity out.And your solution to that is DanielPredictably everyone starts bickering.My phone buzzes. Its been doing that a lot this past hour I hope I havent missed any important texts from our brokerIts Sinead.SS Thank youIK SS Amy was having a bit of a rough daySS She desperately needed the encouragementSS I know that mustve been hard to do but you had great timing and it meant a lotI dont know how to reply to that.IK You know it had nothing to do with my supposed crush on Amy rightSS You were just being a decent human being for once Kabra. I get it.IK Thank you.SS For real thoughIK No. Shut up.I have three more unread texts. None from our broker thankfully.Amy Thanks so much for everythingHamilton Thank you broJonah 3I sigh.Maybemaybe it might all just work out after all.I tap out a quick reply to Amy Anytime were family now. For the record the meeting went a lot better than I thought it would good job.I delete the period add a smiling keyboard emoticon and hit send before my mother gets into my head or I have a chance to secondguess myself.AC Youre a massive cynic thenIK Alright heres some optimism for you. We all had commitments but we set everything aside just to hang out with each other. I dont expect everything anything really to go perfectly but its all going to work out eventually.I dont know whether it will though. I dont know anything except for the fact that as a Lucian I will never be wired for optimism no matter how hard I try.I delete the text and crash onto my pillow drifting into a peaceful slumber for the first time in months. Hamilton Ham.I glance up. Its Reagan.I toss her a friendly punch. Hey you.Are you Her eyes nervously dart around the room before she apparently changes her mind. Uh Mads wanted to talk to you about something. Erm...good nightNightMy phone suddenly erupts into an orchestral arrangement of the James Bond theme.What the hellReagan looks utterly bemused as her eyes widen and she darts out the room with a strained MadsIts ringing.Except...this isnt my ringtone. My normal ringtone is a 3minute long mashup of Converge and Metallicas greatest hits I pirated off the web. Its a freaking masterpiece.I pick up anyway.Hamilton Holt.You know who this is yo.I let out a deep sigh of relief. Jonah.So...did you like itHuhWe both know you think youre too cool for orchestral musicOh. Oh. That was youGuilty.But how how did you did you hack my phoneHe shrugs. You asked for it.Because I insulted the classical remix of Lil GangstaIt was an orchestral remix. And its not that. I accept preferences yo.ButThe art of mashup the concept of fusion in general its an extremely iffy one yo. It doesnt work for everyone particularly symphony or hiphop purists. Some styles go together some are harder to blend.Exactly I like Lil Gangsta but Im Jonah Wizard yo. I cannot I will not have the boy Im crushing on discounting an entire genre of music just because hes got it confused with another completely unrelated genre or because he thinks hes too cool to enjoy a style that was popular a couple hundred years ago. Im better than that even if you refuse to believe you are.I let out a sharp breath. Did you just sayYes Holt. His voice is muffled and he sounds uncharacteristically nervous.He isnt serious is he He cant be. Thatd be...essentially impossible.I like you. Ive liked you for months now. And I dont think Ill stop liking you anytime soon. When I dont reply he adds As in Id be more than kind of sort of open to the possibility of...maybe dating Or going out or even just hanging out together more often just the two of us possibly taking our friendship to the next level. Because I like spending time with you and I spend almost every minute of the day wanting more and when we do hang out I just keep like yearning to tell you yknowI dont know how to respond.Say something Hamilton. You cant leave me hanging goshdarnit.I...Jonah.Hamilton his voice catches. Its okay. I get it. Ill get over it. I can hear his short staccato breaths over the line. I didnt I didnt think I didnt know how you felt I just I probably built the whole thing up in my head. Ive been known to do that. I just thought after today I thought you were sending me all these signals and I probably misinterpreted them...its cool yo. We can still be bros.I spring up and practically skip into the bathroom locking the door and lowering my voice. Jonah. I like you too.An anxious laugh escapes him. Oh oh my... Hes practically wheezing. Ham. Please tell me youre serious.Totally 100 serious my man.Hes silent for a beat. I hell Hamilton.Yyeah. UhI didnt think Jonah you were my first celebrity crush and my sexual awakening when I was thirteen. And thenand then the clue hunt happened and we started to hang out and I started to like you as a person and I dont think Ive felt closer to anyone before it isnt even just attraction anymore Its youre my best friend. I cant believe this feels like a dream I never imagined it was Mutual. I know. Im grinning like an idiot. Sowhat nowWhy is this so awkwardI think this is the part where you ask me out to coffee or something. Something lowkey preferably.Why meI called you. The balls in your court yo.Uhwhat about the paparazziA pregnant pause.Holy crap. Hamilton. I have a proposition for you. That does not involve either of us coming out anytime soon. Ifif yknow thats an issue.I let out a relieved breath. Yes Id I dont mind doing it for you I promise but Id rather justnot right now.I mean being queer isnt much of an issue with my dad. Im pretty sure he knows. Ive dated guys on the downlow before.You guys plural I mean thats okay but Ive never actuallyMostly flings. He hastens to check himself. Youre nothing like that I promise.Yeah soI dont want everyone to know right now. The press would have a field day with my sexuality which really isnt that big a deal andIm actually pansexual. ButI dont want to be branded as a pan stereotype as a flirt or promiscuous just because I have more options theyre mutually exclusive And thats not even taking all the inevitable slutshaming into account. As for coming out as a pan celebrity at sixteenI dont want any unwanted advances andI get it I sigh. I have no idea how my dad would react. Weve never had the talk or ever discussed anything to do with teen sexuality orI dont know whatever it is Im supposed to know.Yeah so. I was thinkingI could hire you as my bodyguard.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/518190,all that's gilded,Jess had fallen in love with the antique ring as soon as she first had laid eyes on it which unfortunately was after it was thrown across a garage. It was fine now and made a nice home for itself on the fourth finger on her left hand. It was beautiful really. She could look at it all night if it was up to her. Jess had never been one for flashy materialistic thingshell Ruth had to force her into wearing skirt her junior year in high schoolbut somehow the glint of the modest ring diamond made Jess want to cry out with joy.Shes been engaged for two years now. She was supposed to wait until after college before getting married but they decided to change things after Douglas made aninteresting announcement. Jess had transferred to the University of Indiana but she wouldnt be graduating on time thanks to that brief stint at Julliard. Now instead of majoring in orchestraor whatever exactly they called it at Julliardshe was attempting to get her teaching degree. So of course she would have to put in another year before she could get her teaching diploma.Then Douglas just ruined everything. He had been her favorite brother until this. Douglas might have let it slip that at Thanksgiving dinner that really they only wanted to hire the best teachers at the alternative and really he thought shed be great but it really wasnt his final decision to make and that a masters degree would look better than just a plain ole bachelors.The conversation ended with Jess promptly shoving her elbow right below his ribcage.She wasnt looking forward to added years of school. College wasnt the piece of crap known as high school and there wasnt as many people she wanted to punch in the faceonly Joey di Josepho but honestly the cheesy Guido accent and the hair gel were the Big Nothere. It was just school and learning. Jess was so over learning.She wanted to graduate and get married and move on with her life.Well at least now she was getting onto the married. After some heavy convincing she managed to get her mother motivated to set the date for this fall. After all if she was going to be in school through her mid twenties she felt it was just accepted to get it over with. Only she didnt use that phrasing with her mom. She used more you can out the decorations type words.Only her mother didnt quite see it that way.Honestly Jessica you make it sound like youre crossing the street. This is important. Its a milestone. A milestone Now what are we going to do about invitations Have you even thought of theme No Jessica you are not going to send out of mass email.So that settled it. This fall she would be Mrs. Jess Wilkins. This September.Which was in one week.Thinking about that Jess tried to calm the panic that threatened to seize her throat. She loved Rob. Really she truly did. Its just that when she actually thought about marriage and settling down She didnt want another boy thats for sure. But she just felt nervous. That was it. Just the nervesIt was three in the morning when she looked at the clock. Less than a week now. Oh God. But no she would be fine and Rob would be fine and everything would be done and good. Right. Oh honestly Jessica you shouldnt be sleeping in so late. Theres just too much to do today. Her mother chided her at seven in the morning.Jess tried to answer but the response was some sort of mashed up gurgle. Instead she threw the covers back over her head regretting that she opted to spend the week leading up to the ceremony at her parents house rather than Robs which she had been living inmuch to her mothers controversyfor the past two years.Jessica Her mother tore the comforter off. Up. Now.And thats how Jess fully woke up that morning. She realized again that though she briefly slept it had been a dreamless sleep. As usual.Its just the nerves she told herself ignoring the photo of a missing infant Rosemary had emailed to her to find.Its just the nerves. The nervous energy that had come from getting engaged. The nerves from starting over at a new college. The nerves of moving in with the boy of her dreams. The nerves of pushing the wedding forward.It was really just the nerves. Thats why she hadnt been able to find anyone since Hannah those long two years ago. She was just too nervous. And too stressed. Only it frustrated Jess to no end because she wasnt broken anymore. She was Jess Mastriani who had her life in control. So why couldnt she find anyone So much of her time spent with ESP she thought of it as a burden which it was. But now that the Feds had backed off Jess thought she could finally make peace with it.Only nothing.Its just because of the nerves.I should have skipped lunch Ruth groaned looking at her reflection in the mirror.Jess shrugged you look fine. Really Ruth. Ruth had managed to drop those extra forty pounds shed been carrying around throughout her adolescent years but she would forever remain selfconscious about her waistline which is why she choose to don a silver bridesmaid dress. Supposedly it was the new slimming shade. Jess didnt know. She let Ruth pick out the dress. Jess had implied that a quick elopement in Vegas wearing jeans and a tshirt would suit her well enough but both Ruth and her mother had put an end to that.Ruth grimaced once more at her reflection. Ill just do a fruit salad for dinner and skip breakfast for the next five days. She pulled out her purse and started rummaging in it. So about your hair. I was thinking maybe we could curl it She let the sentence hang in the air.Curl it Jess ran a finger through her short kept hair. She had let it grow enough so that it was halfway down her neck. If you curl it Robll have longer hair. I thought we were just going to do like a poof with my bangs and I dunno. Maybe put in a nice headband and uh spray in some glitter or some crap.Ruth blinked.Spray in glitter Jessica Mastriani this is your wedding not your eighth grade semi formal Like either Ruth or Jess had gone to that. Plus I bought you these. She pulled what she had been searching in her bag for.No way in hell am I wearing those.But JessI like my short hair. Jess answered scowling at the hair extensions Ruth held up.Dont you just want to feel like a princess JessWhile Jess knew that Ruth was trying to be a good friend like she had been since forever Jess was getting sick of everyone trying to change her.No. I want to feel like Jess Mastriani not like Barbie. Ruth didnt say anything after that. That night Jess Mastriani woke up in a plane. Hold on. Lets back it up a minute.She was riding Blue Beauty downtown when her cell phone started ringing. She ignored it as she did the speed limit. But by the time she made it through three red lights it didnt stop buzzing. She pulled over to the side and didnt recognize the number or the area code.HelloAn unfamiliar voice answered back Jessica MastrianiNot answering the question she replied who is this Howd you get my numberSilence greeted her which only increased her nerves. Great. Jess felt a lump form in her throat. Just what she needed. Creepy guys calling her.Please dont feel threatened Ms. Mastriani. I need your help. My daughter She detected a large trace of sorrow in his voice. I need you to find her.Jess groaned.Look I dont where you got this number but I dont do that anymore okay The sparks gone. The energys fizzled. The bombs defused. Its not like she didnt want to help. Its just that this time she really couldnt.She was about to press the end button until his voice interrupted her please Miss Mastriani. I would not be calling an amateur if I wasnt desperate.Whoa whoa whoa wait just a minute. Amatuer. Amatuer. Jess Mastriani was not an amateur. She had not found every single missing person for two and a half years including notorious war criminals to gain the reputation of an amateur. Maybe the ESP turned itself off now but that didnt mean her record did.Uh excuse me but I am a professional. With a military record. She couldnt contain the annoyance in her voice. Im sorry about your daughter. But I cant find her. Im busy too like Im getting married in a few days. Seriously the ESP isnt working anymore. Im sure the policeYou dont get it The voice blared back at her. The police havent even ruled it as a kidnapping yet. They And suddenly the hardwired started crying in the phone. Jess felt bad she really did. If it was up to her she would give this guy his daughter back. But it wasnt. Please just look at her photo. Then suddenly she got a new picture message. Lo and behold it was a girl no older than Hannah.Im really sorry sir. Then Jess hung up the phone.It was dark by the time Jess decided to head home. She was flying past the cornfields on a deserted road when the car came out of nowhere. Jess couldnt think coherently about what had happened until she was twenty feet in the air and Blue Beauty was in pieces in the road. Then everything went black.Are you feeling alright Ms. Mastriani I could get you an Advil or some waterMeeehrushpmph was the answer Jess gave finally sitting up. Man her head was pounding. And God did her back hurt. Then she remembered the accident. What happened Where am IThe man sat across from her smiled pleasantly as if getting your motorcycle totaled was good thing.You see Miss Mastriani I really need your help. That voice. A few hours ago it sounded unfamiliar but now she was quite acquainted with it.You serious right now Jess said. She could feel her eyes practically bug out of her face. You did not just kidnap me. You have no idea how upset my mother is going to be when I dont come home.His face darkened considerably. As a matter of fact I am well aware of how devastated mothers can be when their children dont come home.Oh right. His daughter had been kidnapped.Youve been out for a good few hours. I expect that you know good and well where Pierce is.Jess was about to started her I Dont Have The Gift Anymore speech when suddenly she realized somethingShe did know where Pierce was.Ohmigod she said incredulously. It felt like suddenly the breath had been knocked out of her.Pierces dad seemed to look a tad uncomfortable. Miss MastrianiThat snapped Jess back into the current situation.First of all I have connections with the United States Government so you are going to be in some very big trouble. Second of all you need to get this plane to bring me back to Indiana right now. Thirdly I need to contact with the Isla Huesos police department immediately.Mr. Pierces dad seemed to perk up immensely.You found her Oh I must tell her mother right away. Where is sheIm not telling you Jess said crossing her arms. It may have seemed childish but Jess new better than to let a parent interfere. Especially if it involved a teenage runaway and the boyfriend. The parents always mess things up. Im going to need to the police.His stupid smile vanished from his face.She ranaway Jess shrugged as if that would explain it. You think the minute her dad appears shes not going to bolt.Pierce did not runaway his eyes narrowed. Of course now she would have to go through the My Child Isnt That Kind of Person act.Just let me tell the police. Then turn this plane around so I can go home capicheHe glared even more menacingly at her. Oh no. Youre not going anywhere until my Pierce is found safe and sound.Whoa. Uh excuse me but Im getting married in like five days. Im kind of tied up at the moment. The groom probably thinks I got cold feet and jetted. Once she said that a cold feeling suddenly crept into her stomach. What if that was what everyone thought right now What if they thought she left on purposeBut the motorcycle in pieces on the Indiana highwayThey probably think youre dead Mr. Pierces dad finished the thought for her out loud.I need to call my mom and Rob right now. She yelled at him. Then I need to call the Isla Huesos police. They can find Pierce and arrest your ass at the same time.He didnt seem so phased by her threat. Why dont you just tell them in person. Id like to welcome you to Isla Huesos Florida.I hate it Jess mumbled.That makes two of us.It was then that his phone rang did he let go of Jess arm after stepping out of the plan that Jess ran as fast she could from this guy.She didnt look back to see if he was following her.When she was far enough away she saw a payphone. Just a quick call and she could be back on a plane to Indiana where no doubt her mom was crying over what she thought happened to her only daughter.But then she thought about Pierce Olivieras mom. And how upset she must be.Oh this better just be quick Jess said to herself.Florida was not Indiana that much could be said for sure. In Indiana nobody rallied in the streets to celebrate death day or whatever it was they had going on. It was some festival Jess had seen the advertisements plastered all over the small community before arriving in the center of the town. People were dressed up in an odd assortment of clothing. Jess could have sworn they were celebrating Halloween.Despite the exhilarating crowd and the many obstaclesmainly consisting of people throwing food in her face to test outJess found exactly what she wanted surrounded by what she disliked more than most things. There Pierce Oliviera was right in the middle of Isla Huesos chatting it up with a cheerleader.Just like that the fear Jess had harbored about Pierce being in mortal peril vanquished. She got kidnapped for thisPierce was still talking with the cheerleader. Jess suddenly became aware that this cheerleader was also fitting the Halloween spirit splattering her outfit with fake blood. However dead cheerleaders brought back less than happy memories for Jess so she quickly brought her attention to the task at hand.Scanning the crowd she found what she was looking for. Assuming that Pierce had run off on her own and came back for a friendly visit Jess suspected that the guy from her dream would be nearby. Guys who get girls to runaway from home without a trace were typically clinging and possessive enough to not let the girl of their dreams out of sight for too long. He was brooding in a corner. He was tall and strong taller and stronger than Rob was and definitely more brutal looking than Jeff Day.And kept his eyes pierced on well Pierce.This wouldnt be any easy rescue mission.She couldnt just swoop in grab Pierce and get out without anyone noticing. No one could notice because then Jess would be the girl who found Pierce Oliviera all the way in Florida. Pierces name was already flooded in the press. Her rescuer would be too. And how could Jess say she just happened to find Pierce who lived all the Florida when she had been in all the way not in FloridaThe Spark Reignites Lightning Girl Returns She could envision the headlines already. And she really really didnt want headlines. This was going to stay out of the press and Jess was going to stay under the radar the way she liked it.The idea came to her when someone thrust a Capns Morgans Ra Ra Raspberry Whiskey Wonder into her hand and walked away before she could decline. And then she found herself much closer to a now cheerleaderless Pierce than she intended.Ohmigod I am so sorry Look at the mess I made Here let me help you clean that up Jess exclaimed much more enthusiastically than was needed as she looked at the huge red stain taking over Pierces shirt. She gripped her elbow and pulled her into the bathroom slamming the door behind them. And locking it for good measure. Then situating herself in front of it.Its really not that big of a deal Pierce said eyeing the bathroom. She didnt wait for Jess to help her with the shirt and began matting the stain down with water.Use this Jess handed her the TidetoGo she carried around with her. What She used to work the steam table at Joe Jr.s and had become very acquainted with ruined clothing. Old habits die hard. I know your shirt isnt a big deal but running away from home Thats pretty significant.The easer pen felt on the floor. Pierce whirled around looking defeated when she realized Jess was blocking her exit.Its not like thatJess rolled her eyes. I dont care what its like Pierce. But your parents do. And they called me so I could bring you home. So lets get a move on.Pierce shook her head looking like shes about to burst into tears.I already went home okay Theyll know Im safe now.How old was this girl anyway Jess wondered. She looked to be at least sixteen seventeen probably not eighteen but she was acting about twelve.Look Pierce I want to help you out. And you gotta go home. You cant runaway with some guyHes not just some guy She shouted sounding hysterical. I love him not that its any of your business. She said the last part a bit shortly. She stood up straight walking closer to Jess. She had to be at least five inches taller but that wasnt much to brag about. Size did not intimidate Jess Mastriani. Jess had been beating the crap out of people double her stature since kindergarten in order to cower to this girl. Though as of recent years she had retired her physical enforcements replacing them with more diplomatic ways.That didnt mean she wouldnt punch the girl in throat if the circumstance called for it.Im sure you love him Jess agreed toying with then ends of her hair. God she couldnt wait to get married and get a hair cut. The Florida humidity was not being kind to her longer locks.Pierce must have sensed the sarcasm in her voice. No you dont get it. We love each other. Hes protecting me.Let me guessed he asked you to runaway with him Jess needed to shake this girls idea.Pierce swallowed hard. Well not exactly.Well this was getting interesting. So he took you against your willPierce didnt answer. She couldnt even look Jess in the eye anymore.Its just I knew where he was going to take me and I didnt like it the last time I was there. She admitted but I like there now. It suits our relationship if you really think about because I wasnt sure about him at first but now I am. I love him. She seemed a bit embarrassed at her sudden rush of words.Jess gave Pierce an incredulous look. Okay Pierce that is very heartfelt but lets get this show on the road. Cmon.You dont understand This time Pierce was hysterical. I cant go back. I have to do this. I cant go back to them. Its dangerous. I told Uncle Chris that. He understands.Jess grabbed Pierces wrist and opened the door. Try not to make a scene. And then they were back at the fiesta.Stop Pierce begged although not loud enough to draw attention. You dont understand. John will be mad. Nothing and I mean nothing will stop him from finding me Youre only putting yourself in danger She tried to pull her arm away but Jess was expecting that only holding tighter.You dont get it Pierce repeated for what had to the millionth time. If you dont let me go hes going to hurt you.Sounds like you got yourself a real catch Jess answered in return. She may have caught a glimpse of the wellbuilt man but that hardly phased Jess. She hadnt gotten struck by lightning almost gotten her head bashed in inside of a cave took on a psycho football player raided a notorious white supremacists headquarters sought out terrorists throughout the Middle East and busted an underage porn ring to be scared off by some teenagers angry boyfriend.Hes trying to protect me she sniffed. You just dont understand. You cant let yourself get caught up in my mess. I dont want you to get hurt too.Jess didnt care to continue the conversation. Instead she brought Pierce into an alley where she could get through the crowd of people easier and get this kid to police cruiser that had to be lurking around due to the massive festival going down.Of course that was before Jess realized she walked straight into six foot three inches of massive chaos.John Well at least Pierce sounded relieved.,Teen And Up Audiences,Not Found
https://archiveofourown.org/works/50103817,Third life‚Äôs the charm,Come Aristia. He beckoned her over with a smile so wide it was as if he did not have a care in the world. As if he was not chained to his bed restraints digging into his skin so deeply the bone of his flesh was slightly visible. As if he was not dying. She straightened her back and walked briskly to him sitting down on the bed. Leave us. Her voice was eerily quiet and calm. The last time she sounded like that was when she found out her father was murdered by her husband. The moment she opened her eyes in her second life she promised herself she would not lose anyone ever again. Yet here she was back to square one unable to do anything but watch as someone she loved died. How ironic. The seven guards stationed quickly left the room as five familiar faces entered the room. Master. They greeted him quietly. My beloved apprentices. I do not have much time left so I shall make this quick. I spent thousands of years wandering around the world with no purpose. But you six are the only ones who allowed me to finally regain my sense of emotions. The 15 years we have spent together are the best years of my life. But my time is up. He coughed. We will meet again in our next lives. And we will be family just as we have been for the last few years. He stared at them intently his black eyes shifting over to each of them. Remember. Live . He locked eyes with her as he took his last breath before his eyes finally became empty. Three of them gave in to their emotions quickly sobbing. Felix gently closed the mans eyes. Aristia held her masters cold hand silently staring at his ring as tears ran down her face. Alexis watched gazed at the old mans face with regret. We can fix this. Felix said. The room finally became silent as he held out six small sapphires. The remaining pieces of Aionios. They glittered in the light as he gave one to each of them. We need to infuse our life magic into them. He explained. Then what happens One of them asked. Well die and go back in time to a random year in our past. He explained. What are the side effects Alexis asked. Our memories of this life will vanish. But that can be easily fixed. Jesse can cast a spell to preserve our memories. After five years well get them back. That should be enough time for us to grow up properly and gain the power we need. He told them. Well have enough time to stop the Uprising and save Master. Daisy nodded. Lets do it. They each held a piece of sapphire in one hand. Benjamin grinned. See you on the other side. They crushed the jewels. A second later light flooded the room and then they were gone. Aristia opened her eyes to a familiar ceiling for the third time. She sighed. I hoped I would forget everything like they did but once again God is not on my side. It was Aristias third life. In her first life she lived the miserable life of an abandoned empress who was executed for treason against the crown after stabbing her husband who murdered her father. In her second life she was reincarnated to the moment she found out her father was dead. She ran away and lived 15 more years than she did in her first life only to lose one of the people she deemed precious. This time she would not lose him again. Lina She called. The maid came in immediately. Lady Tia are you feeling unwell Youve been sleeping since yesterday afternoon Lady Tia She suddenly shrieked. Aristia jumped confused at the horrified expression on the maids face. What is that She whispered pointing to the tip of her shoulder. Ah. Jesse didnt remove it. This complicates things. There was a small glaring inky tattoo on her left shoulder. It was a mark designed by her Master given only to his apprentices. Lina listen to me and listen well. You did not see anything understand The girl immediately straightened up. I will ensure that I am the only maid who dresses you from now on Lady Tia. She told her earnestly. Aristia smiled a little. How old am I Lina frowned slightly. 10. Are you feeling alright Lady Tia She asked. Quite. She suddenly gasped. Where is my father She asked. On the training grounds. Wait Lady Tia Where are you going She dashed out of her room and ran her heart beating faster than ever. Please let him be alive. Please. She stopped as she caught sight of the handsome whitehaired man in the middle of the field. My Lady The knights around the area froze as she ran past them. Tia Her father turned around and yelped in surprise as she hugged him sobbing. Papa Im sorry. She cried clinging onto him tightly. He glared at the knights around them who stared at them with confusion before quickly turning around. He knelt down and hugged her. Its alright Tia. He told her. She wiped her tears away staring at his face. His eyes were filled with love as he fondly patted her head. How could I ever think he didnt love me Come let us go to your room. Ill have a hot chocolate sent there to calm you down. He carried her away from the training grounds. 5 minutes later she was on her bed sipping hot cocoa quietly as her father stared at her concerned. What happened Tia He asked. She smiled tightly at him. Just a nightmare. She answered. He sighed. Youre still a child. I must attend to some matters at the palace. Stay here and rest. She tightened her grip around his hand when he tried to leave. Dont go Papa. She pleaded. He sighed before lighting up. Why dont you come with me The emperor has been asking for you. He suggested. This is a good chance to stop the engagement between me and that man. Lets go Father. Father. He flinched and stared at her. Why dont you call me like before He muttered. Pardon She asked. He shook his head. Its nothing. Who knew her father was such a softie when she was a child. Papa. Must I marry him She asked quietly. I thought you were happily preparing to marry the prince. He said. I dont want to marry him or anyone. I just want to stay here with you Papa. She told him earnestly. He smiled and patted her head. Well see. He got off the carriage and held his hands out. Im too old to be carried by you Papa She whispered. He chuckled. No one will say a thing. True enough everyone at the site averted their gaze suddenly finding the floor interesting. She hesitated before going into his arms. He held her and walked through the halls of the palace. She shuddered internally at the awfully familiar sight of the place where she suffered for years. Enter. He put her down as the large doors opened revealing the emperor sitting on the throne talking to a red haired man. That must be Arkint De Rass next to Alexis father Ruth De Verita. He looks kind. I see youve finally brought your precious daughter Keirean. Hello Aristia. She curtsied. Your Highness. She greeted him. He grinned. Such a polite child unlike my own. That arrogant son of mine needs to be taken down a leg or two. He scowled. Young Aristia what do you think of increasing our taxes to increase the number of knights and soldiers I fear the threat of those plotting the demise of the empire increasing rapidly. He told her. Hes testing me. In the past not only did this policy fail it caused many riots among commoners who couldnt afford to pay their taxes. In the past Alexis younger brother came up with the solution years later and was highly praised for it. If I tell the emperor the solution he might see me as a threat to his throne as someone with claim over it. Even worse he might use it as an excuse to strengthen my position as the princes fiance. His eyes bore into hers. Well He asked. I shouldnt say anything. But the people who will suffer and die because of it Her eyes lit up. Your Highness I do not think the policy will work. The empire will soon go through a severe drought. We suffer from them once every thirty to forty years. The fact that our harvest is vastly below average is a sign that it is coming. She explained. Duke De Verita looked at her with surprise written all over his face. Then what solution do you have in mind girl The emperor asked. She kept quiet for a moment. If I tell you will you grant me a wish She asked earnestly. Tia Her father whispered. He chuckled. Very well. If you can come up with a solution I will grant you a wish within my power. He agreed. She took a deep breath. What if we imposed taxes on luxury items She suggested. Duke De Verita inhaled sharply his eyes narrowing at her. The purpose of buying luxury items is for nobles to show off how much money they spent on them. Hence very few people will find problems with it. In fact it will push nobles to buy more to show off their fortune. More importantly the commoners will not suffer from the taxes. She explained. Duke De Verita looked at the emperor his eyes shining. If we collect funds the way the young lady has suggested we will receive very little opposition He told him. Very well. Come up with a plan to execute it. He stared at her with scrutiny. You knew I was testing you. If you had kept quiet you would have been able to avoid suspicion. Dont you know that having a name given by God means you have the right to inherit the throne He bellowed. She winced before bowing her head. That is why I would like to request that my engagement to the prince be annulled. She told them. They stared at her with confusion. I do not think I am suited to be the next empress just because I have a Godgiven name. Who knows I may not even be the girl in the prophecy. Hence I would like to call off our engagement. She told them. I spent years thinking I was going to be Empress just to be made Queen because Ji Eun was found to be the true woman in the prophecy. Are you aware what will happen if the engagement is called off Nobles of the opposing faction would leap at this chance thinking there is a drift between the relationship between Duke La Monique. He said sternly. You said you would grant any wish within your power Your Majesty. Duke De Verita agreed with her. The emperor sighed. The fact that you were able to come up with such a policy makes me reluctant to let you go. When you turn fifteen we will discuss this again. Leave now. He waved his hand as they left the room. Tia wait for me here. I must discuss something with Arkint. He told her. She nodded and looked outside as he left. That tree She walked outside and touched the bark. Its still here. She muttered quietly. Your Highness the emperor requests your presence. She froze. I know. That voice She slowly turned around to see Ruvellis Castina scowling at her. The sight of him made her nauseous. She stepped back her head ringing so loudly she didnt hear what he was saying. Duke La Moniques daughter isnt it She swayed feeling dizzy. His eyes narrowed.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/49582336,The Doll of the Empire,In the empire of Castina Adeli Avielle daughter of Lord Zarin Avielle and his wife Ausra Avielle was born. Her two older brothers already adolescents accomplishing many things were not interested in her. In that case nor was her father. Lord Avielle was a traditional man. One who viewed those sticking to their roles as important. He had no need for a girl who wasnt of marriageable age and so he quickly moved on. Her mother already having two successful sons and fulfilling her role of providing heirs was happy to focus on other matters and didnt care for her at all either. She was put in the hands of the servants and at the tender age of three with her mother complaining about the ruckus she caused was sent to another estate. Where she would be cared for butout of the way until Zarin felt it was appropriate to prepare her for marriage. Adeli was a wild child she loved to explore and play games and was always giving the servants a fright at her antics. They never neglected the child and she was well tended but Adeli never got close enough with them to consider one a nanny or family as they all took turns and kept a distance. Instead she climbed trees and ran outdoors. She had a basic tutor teach her to read and the basics of arts and her classes. She didnt enjoy them as much but that was fine. The freedom filled her with life. It filled the hole her familys abandonment left and cleared her of any worries. She grew from a toddler waddling to a troublesome five year old who left chaos in her mischievous wake and then into a rascal eight year old. A dare devil and a fighter but one that was untested. At eight years old the young Adeli Avielle was lonely but content. Shed tried to make friends in the village nearby but had been met with aggression when her status was discovered. Any who werent scared off by that usually that of more aristocrats and commonwealth folk were scared off by how un ladylike she was. She was teased for her tomboy nature running around in pants and yelling like a boy. The girls excluded her constantly and the boys said she should be doing more girl things. Adeli was used to being alone though and continueds on her way. She didnt change a thing. Yet this certain day she strayed farther from her estate than usual. The young girl at this age had her curls at shoulder length not a straight bob but rich brown curls paired with dark emerald eyes. Her hair was shorter than ladies usually had unusually so in fact but her caretakers kept it that way due to all the trouble she got herself in. It was easier to maintain after all her adventures. As she climbed a tree she heard a voice grumbling. Worried it was bullies and that shed be outnumbered Adeli hid in the trees. The voice Adeli heard was Carsein de Rass the youngest son of Rass house whos country house was only a small distance away. He was a rambunctious blunt and rowdy child as well although quite ruder than Adeli and he had once again escaped his lessons. Hed gone farther to escape his pursuers the family guards and found a grove of trees. A perfect place to hide.That is why he started to climb one which just so happened to be the one Adeli was in. Adeli definitely didnt expect to see a flurry of red hair and bright blue eyes pop up making her gasp. What theAdeli startedCarsein heard the stomping of hooves and quickly covered her mouth with his hand Ssssssshhhhh He hushed. Adeli was shocked into silence and listened with him to the passing of footsteps. It wasnt until the grove fell silent that he removed his hand. What was that for Adeli hissedI didnt want to get caught my lessons are so boring.Adeli tilted her head lessons can be interesting.Carsein frowned Maybe swordsmanship but not much else. Adeli looked him up and down maybe youre just an idiot.Hey Carsein exclaimed.Adeli laughed at his bewildered expression. She liked this boy. Are you good at swordsmanship The boy smirked Im the best Ill have you know. Im already surpassing everyone else I know. People say Ill be the youngest knight the kingdom has ever seen Thats why I run away to practice or train. Is it really that fun Adeli asked in excitement. Yeah. You wanna try Carsein asked. Something about how she looked at him with such excitement made him proud. ButIm a girl Carsein gave her a confused look does that matter A grin broke out on Adelis face NopeAfter that they were inseparable. They met in the fields behind their country homes everyday. Carsein insisted that Adeli train her body before she picked up a sword due to how flimsy her arms looked but also because they got to fool around and hang out more when they did. They climbed trees raced through fields and watched the clouds pass. They played tag and played hide and seek in the nearby wooded areas. They would tackle each other to the ground and bicker. Carsein liked to brag about his skill and talent and Adeli never missed the chance to remind him how terrible he was at his lessons. Its why they worked. Adeli admitted Carsein was skilled and wanted him to teach her but she never let him get a big head and put him in his place. She stood up to him. On the other hand Carsein was the first who ndidnt discriminate against her because she was a girl who dressed in pants and did supposed boyish behavior and just accepted her for who she was. Thats why she started to fall for this mysterious red head who she was excited to get to know. The two never actually got the others name. They definitely would have if they got more time together but it was only after a few memorable weeks that Adelis father returned for her and Adeli would not get to say goodbye. My ladyquickly one of Adelis maids cried we must get you prepared.Wha Adeli was yanked by the arm. WhyYour father is here he was to see you immediately but in the state youre in The fear in her eyes spoke for itselfMy father Adeli repeated shocked. He hadnt visited once her entire life why was he here nowSuddenly the door burst open and a tall man with graying brown hair and an angular face entered the room. His eyes pierced through Adeli with a chilling glare. Who is this The mans voice boomed. A maids childAdeli shivered under his gaze I amAdeli Avielle Sir. The mans expression grew more furious. A feat Adeli didnt know was possible. YouYyyes The child trembled. Are you insinuating that my daughter the Lady of house Avielle is parading around with boyish hair and pants covered in dirt Im sorry sir we didnt mean The maid tried.Shut up snapped the man you have done enough. With that he grabbed Adelis small wrist and started to drag her through the country house. She tried to keep up with his fast pace stumbling behind me.Where are you taking me She asked through unshed tears. Were leaving. He stated as he dragged her out of the estate and into the carriage that was waiting outside. He sat down and Adeli inched to the opposite end of the carriage in an attempt to create some distance between them. Lord Avielle sat with his arms crossed and his head bowed down slightly fuming. You are never to return here. I will not have it.Butwhat about the servants Adeli croaked. Theyll be dismissed of course. They took care of you terribly. Letting you grow up into a heathen right under my nose. A disaster I am left to clean up. I need you to be a marriageable tung lady. One of the most marriageable. Thats what women only use. To help give their family more status and money to continue their legacy and thats what youll do. You will start lessons tomorrow and immediately start learning how to be a proper young lady. Do you understandAdeli nodded silently and started to sniffle. Tears streamed down their faces. Dont cry like that. Lord Avielle barked. Ladies do not cry. Especially out loud. Adeli quieted and the Lord returned his attention to the window with some mutterings about how to figure this mess out. Adeli also looked out the other window. She wondered what was going to happen to her. If her supposed father had anything to do with it.it appeared it her fate would be bleak. Her redhead friend flashed through her mind. Would she ever see him again Would he figure out why she left That thought almost made her laugh. He had no way of knowing why she left and he wasnt the most inquisitive type. She thought of him and the freedom she had with him as the carriage trotted along. She never even got to say goodbye. The moment Adeli got back to Avielle house everything changed. She met her mother once again who simply looked at her blankly and then left without a word and she met her brothers. She had two older brothers. The eldest simply greeted her with cold eyes pushed up his glasses and left. Adeli realized he was in the process of moving out. Her second oldest brother introduced himself as Neo and was much kinder. He shook her hand unlike the rest of the family and smiled warmly. Unfortunately Neo would not be at the house for long periods of time which would leave Adeli isolated with her father.As he promised Adelis lessons started the very next day and would continue for the next 2 years. Her hair was forced to grow long to be styled. She mastered piano dance etiquette how to be elegant how to walk properly all sorts of literature and knowledge a lady would need how to follow fashion s and trends and everything she could possibly learn to be a proper lady. She was always dressed in elegant dresses with well styled hair and accessories to give her poise and grace. She accompanied her father to meetings and banquets as he started to introduce her to society. Which meant introducing what everyone knew would eventually be on the marriage market. Early advertisement for what was to come. Adeli could no longer climb trees or run through fields. She had no freedom to come and go as she pleased following the schedule her father set out. Whenever she had free time she mostly read and practiced for her lessons. Her favorite spot was a cushioned window sill in her room where she often read in the sun or looked out and watched the people below. She could not go outside like she did when she was younger but she enjoyed at least watching nature and the people who could. Her eldest brother Darin left soon after she arrived and she rarely ever saw him again. Neo was around much more and was fun to talk to when she could. He often helped her find books in the library that might interest though discreetly due to their fathers watchful eye. Yet he too was gone for long periods of time for schooling and new business moves Lord Avielle had him go on as he was growing into a man already. Yet even Neo mostly ignored the verbal abuse Adeli received song with how she feared her fathers angry outbursts and how her food was limited to a specific and not healthy diet to keep her slim figure. Or the punishments she received if she acted unlady like according to the Lords standards. Adeli built the facade of the perfect lady around herself to survive and protect herself. It was what her father wanted what her family wanted and what society wanted. What else could she possibly be What choice did she have This is what caused her to have few friends and in fact no friends who could be her true self. All the other ladies she was forced to hang out with wished to get to know her due to her growing reputation as a perfect lady and the such thick masks on Adeli wondered if shed ever know who they truly were. She didnt have any placer to judge though they were all doing the same thing. Perhaps some were simply doing it more happily. The one friend she made was Aristia Monqiue. Aristia of House Monique was the daughter of Lord Monique someone her father often visited for business. She was kind and showed more of her true self and seemed to notice the bits of Adeli that were left in her facade. Adeli loved those visits where they sat and drank tea and chatted. Few moments of freedom. And that was what transpired for 2 years until Adeli was 11 and she met Carsein again.,Teen And Up Audiences,Original Character(s)Is an OC but it is a self-insert and we all know itOC has persoanlity and description and backstory but this can be read as a self insert I promiseNow the real onesChild AbuseImplied/Referenced Child AbuseChild NeglectPhysical AbuseBasically taking away food is used as a punishment so be warnedWhippingWhipping occurs once I'll mark the chapterAngstSlow BurnLots of angst and trauma that's king of my thing if you haven't noticedAngst with a Happy EndingSort of proof readRewriteA bit of canon divergenceOnly small details are changed no giant plot points
https://archiveofourown.org/works/36368953,The Monique's Heir,Chapter 1Carsein why did you behave so rudely to Lady Aristia You hurt the young ladys feelings after she asked for your help. Duchess Erina Shana de Rass said with an irked mark on her forehead. This is not proper etiquette Carsein. The more I speak to you about etiquette and proper manners the more you do the opposite of what I teach. Am I speaking to a brick wall Carsein Mother that girl is the future empress. I dont want anything to do with her mother. She is just saying that she wants to learn swordsmanship when in reality its a pass time for her. I wont train someone who is not serious about it argued Carsein folding his arms across his chest. What is all the fuss about I could hear you both arguing from the main door. Carsein what is the problem this time Duke Arkint de Rass asked looking to his son and then to his wife for answers. Duchess Erina sighed Your son refused Lady Aristias request after she came all the way to our estate seeking his help. Hes refusing to teach her swordsmanship. Plus he acted in an informal manner which was not appropriate to our guest. I didnt act in an informal manner. I simply voiced my concerns about disliking the fact that shes the future empress who is bored of her studies and will not take the swordsmanship training seriously retorted Carsein only to flinch upon seeing his mothers furious gaze.Carsein said Duke Arkint. Lady Aristia has been training with Marquis Keirean la Monique her father for a year and a half. She knows the basics but she doesnt have anyone to teach her in the Monique estate since her father is away with the other knights. Carsein you should give her a chance. Lady Aristia is a wonderful quiet girl who doesnt have many friends. Also Marquis Keirean personally asked me for you to help train her. So have fun. But fath said Carsein only to stop mid sentence as he saw his mothers fierce gaze which told him to mind his manners and not talk back to his father. Carsein flinched a bit before replying to his father I will try to help her in swordsmanship and have fun with Lady Aristia. Great. Now head back to your room and adjust your schedule. You will be spending a lot of time with Lady Aristia. Duke Arkint smiled as he escorted his wife out the room. Ugh I hate this. However I dont hate her remarked Carsein. She had seem really interested in swordsmanship. I guess I could give her a chance. Carsein walked to the weaponry where he selected a sword that would be best suited for Aristias physique. This one will be perfect for her. Now to adjust that schedule. Maybe I can skip etiquette classes with my mother. Ah. Yes sweet relief. The next day Carsein made his way to the Monique estate. When he got there he was escorted to the training grounds where he saw Aristia la Monique already training with her sword. Carsein observed her movements and her technique with the sword. However he suddenly realized that Aristia was pushing herself too hard and that her complexion was quite pale which caused him to worry. Is she trying to kill herself Carsein muttered as he quickened his pace grabbing Aristias arm taking the sword away from her and then began to remove the weights on her arms and legs.Are you crazy Are you trying to kill yourself Wielding your sword while being sick And wearing weights on your arms and legs Do you have a death wish Carsein yelled at Aristia shaking her vigorously trying to bring her back to her senses. Why do you care young lord Rass Just leave me alone growled Aristia in anger smacking away Carseins arms. Why are you even here young lord Rass Didnt you reject me after learning about me being the future Empress Leave this estate and never come. Mia please escort the young lord to his carriage. Aristia took back her sword from Carsein before returning to her training session. Carsein looked at Aristia with a mixture of both shock and anger. He couldnt bear the fact that she wasnt taking her bodys health into consideration. He came here to train her but he couldnt since he was now officially kicked out. Carsein glared at Aristia back. Fine. Dont listen to me. Do whatever you want. Just know that pushing yourself like this will cause you to be sick even more. As Carsein walked away Aristia gritted her teeth before continuing to swing her sword. With each swing she felt like her body was suddenly becoming heavy. Why is my body feeling so heavy I cant move my arms and my legs are trembling. I feel so sleepy like I want to just lay down right here. Aristia mumbled before falling to the ground blacking out immediately. Lady Aristia Carsein yelled out running to Aristias side with Mia. She has a fever. Quickly call for the physician. Lady Aristia hold on. Mia nodded her head running towards the manor. Carsein instantly scooped up Aristia in her arms racing to the manor shouting The young lady has collapsed. Call for the physician. The Monique manor fell into utter chaos as the servants frantically called for the physician while trying to care for their young mistress. Carsein stayed by Aristias side the entire time from the moment he laid her down on her bed to the moment the physician gave his diagnosis. She seems to be stressed. It could be that she misses the Marquis and worries about his safety at the border. She should be fine in a couple of days. She needs to rest a lot and to take things easy for the time being said the physician to the head butler Marcus. Thank you. We will take care of the young mistress and her health thanked Marcus escorting the physician to the front door. Excuse me Head Butler Marcus. Carsein said politely. Would Lady Aristia be alright Marcus looked at the boy who saved their young ladys life and said with a smile Yes young Lord Rass. She is fine for now. The physician said that she needs to rest. Carsein sighed in relief at Marcus words. Thats good news. I hope she has a speedy recovery. I will return home for today. Please inform Lady Aristia that she will be seeing me here more often for training. Well see you tomorrow Marcus. Goodbye young Lord Rass said Marcus in a formal and polite voice lowering his head in respect. Carsein entered the carriage and rode all the way home without making any stops. When he got home he immediately made his way to the sitting room in search of his mother but only to find his father and brother Kaysian de Rass playing chess in the sitting room. Good afternoon. Father. Kaysian. Is mother around I need to speak to her. Your mother is in her room. Is there something you want Sein asked Duke Arkint looking at his younger son. No. I just want to have a chat with my mother thats all. See you at dinner father. Carsein said before leaving the room.As Carsein ascended the staircase making his way down the long corridors only to stop in front of his parents room. Carsein sighed raising his hand knocking on the door Mother may I come in You can enter Carsein said Duchess Erina. Carsein opened the door entering the room to see his mother sitting by the window reading a book. Mother I do apologize for disturbing you but I came to inform you that I would be teaching Lady Aristia about swordsmanship. Duchess Erina placed her book down and turned her head in Carseins direction. Do you have the patience to teach the young lady about swordsmanship It wont be an easy task Carsein. You should consider that the young ladys body is small and fragile and its different from a boys. I understand that now mother. I need to apologize to Lady Aristia and make amends for the harsh words I had spoken to her. I also need to fulfill my promise to her spoke Carsein with determination in every word. Duchess Erina subtly smiled at her son. Very well. Since you are determined to help the young lady I wont stop you. Just bear in mind that her body is frail and it will take time for her to adjust to the new training method. So be considerate to the young lady.Yes mother I will keep that in mind. Thank you. Carsein said bowing his head before exiting his mothers room. As Carsein made his way to his room he stopped in his tracks and groaned. I forgot to tell Mr. Marcus about me teaching Lady Aristia. Ugh How could I have forgotten this important thing Carsein sighed to himself before walking to his room. Upon entering his room he immediately gathered his things and began scribbling down a regimen based on Aristias physique. As he finished writing down everything that needed to be done there were 10 pages piled on his desk. Oh boy. Carsein sighed as he ordered and organized the pages. Knock. Knock. Young master. Its time for dinner. The Duke and Duchess are waiting for you. Yes. Ill be done in a bit. Carsein called out to the butler who was standing outside his room.Carsein neatly tapped the papers on the desk before securing them with a clip. As he made towards the dining room he couldnt help but remember Aristias face as she smacked his hand away. She must really hate me for what I had said to her. This is all my fault. I need to make amends. Carsein entered the dining room greeting both the duke and duchess along with his older brother. Dinner smoothly commenced from the appetizers to the dessert and then he quietly dismissed himself from the table saying goodnight.Carsein went into his room once more quickly writing a letter to the Monique estate signing and sealing the letter with his wax stamp. I will send this letter in the morning letting them know that I will be visiting the estate in 4 days to check on Lady Aristia.While Carsein prepared for his visit to the Monique estate unbeknownst to him Lady Aristia had to visit the imperial palace despite being severely ill. During her visit she was close to fainting in front of the Emperor and the Crown Prince. Luckily she made it out of there with her own two feet however this made her condition worse.Marcus can we depart for the fief tomorrow I need to get away from the capital. Aristia said with a pale face. My lady but your condition hasnt improved and the young lord Rass will be visiting in 3 days time. Shouldnt we wait until after his visit Marcus inquired with a concerned look on his face. I will be fine Marcus. Also can you inform the Lord Carsein Rass that I will be leaving for the fief tomorrow and that his visit will have to wait Yes my lady. I will inform the young lord about this. The preparations for your journey will be completed by tomorrows morning. Thank you Marcus. I will be in my room resting.Aristia made her way to her room where her maid took off her dress and quickly dressed her in comfortable sleeping attire. Aristia slowly climbed into bed covering herself with the thick blanket hoping that she could sweat out the fever. She snuggled more into her blanket and pillow quickly falling asleep. The next day the Monique manor was busy with the preparations for their young ladys departure. By midday the carriage with Aristia inside quickly departed the imperial capital. She had already sent word to both the Emperor and the Rass house about her departure. During the journey to the Moniques fief Aristia rested in the carriage with her maid Mia at her side checking on her condition. When they got to the fief the carriage drove straight to the Moniques mansion where the staff was awaiting their arrival. As the carriage came to a stop Aristia came out and greeted the head butler Hector Marcus father. My lady welcome home. Your room has been prepared and dinner will be served soon. Hector said in a formal manner bowing his head to Aristia. We also have tea prepared for you in the sitting room.Thank you Hector. Aristia thanked Hector entering the mansion and walking towards the sitting room. In the sitting room Arista comfortably drank her cup of tea waiting for dinner to be served. My lady. Dinner is ready said Mia. Oh Well lets go. Aristia commented placing her tea cup down and heading towards the dining room. Dinner quickly ended and Aristia was tucked into bed by Mia before leaving the room. Aristias thoughts wandered back to her first life with the Crown Prince. Aristia shivered at the mere thought of that Crown Prince. She could never bring herself to face him even if he ordered her to. The Crown Prince scares her her mental state and anxiety stemmed from his mistreatment towards her. She tried her best to be a perfect empress for him yet she was tossed aside like a broken toy that a child no longer wants to play with. Her trauma was so deep that she would only hesitate when she was around him. My only way out is to become fathers rightful heir. My birthright. My title. This was my only choice. No This should have been my only choice. Being the Crown Princes fianc√©e was something I didnt want from the beginning. Ive always wanted to remain here...with my father Sophie Marcus and the knights. To be treated as the Moniques heir and not as the Crown Princes fianc√©e. That night Aristia finally made up her mind after a year of coming back to the past to become Moniques successor and to annul her engagement with the Crown Prince.,General Audiences,RomanceDramaSlow RomanceDrama & RomanceRomantic FluffFantasyHistoricalAlternate UniverseChildhood FriendsFriends to LoversAlternate Universe - Childhood FriendsReincarnationAlternate Universe - ReincarnationWriter's BlockSide StorySecond ChancesPOV Third Person

Ni siquiera se esforzaba en ocultar su desagrado al ser elegida para atender sus necesidades adem√°s de transmitir el mensaje que ya conoc√≠a. Incluso sab√≠a que despu√©s de salir no ten√≠a nada m√°s por hacer. Era necesaria tanta parafernalia Pudieron encargar esa labor a los guardias apostados en la puerta y darle un tiempo a solas.

Agit√≥ la mano en direcci√≥n a la puerta y volvi√≥ a su posici√≥n frente a la ventana perdi√©ndose la expresi√≥n ofendida de la sirvienta.

Obviamente lo intentaron mantener en secreto de una p√©sima manera a trav√©s de burlas e indiscretos comentarios.

Respirar y exhalar se convirti√≥ en un mantra y una irrompible regla. Gracia a eso pudo escabullirse detr√°s de la pared espiando por la rendija dejada.

Y usarla como su marioneta un exclusivo premio al aceptar trabajar en ese lugar.Hubiera escapado cuando tuve la oportunidad. Dijo al aire continuando con el recuerdo de los hombres y mujeres reunidos en el sal√≥n principal.Ellos sab√≠an la raz√≥n de ser convocados por el administrador sus expresiones de regocijo no se ocultaban unos pocos parec√≠an cansados o indiferentes considerando innecesario causar tanto alboroto por algo de lo que todos estaban enterados con antelaci√≥n pero deb√≠a ser completamente oficial para cumplir con los requerimientos y sin cavos sueltos.Tras un discurso aburrido y mon√≥tono estaba por regresar a su habitaci√≥n y tomar esa siesta cuando escucho al administrador revelar el cierre total de la misi√≥n. Felicitando a todos al cumplir maravillosamente con sus √≥rdenes sin manchar la reputaci√≥n de su maestro y honrarlo a trav√©s de sus diligentes acciones ante la m√°s m√≠nima sospecha de parte de su invitada.

Negar que sinti√≥ algo de satisfacci√≥n cuando los vio con sangre y heridas que tardar√≠an en sanar seria hip√≥crita de su parte no tardo mucho tiempo en llegar al primer piso y amenazar a todos con una de esas espadas ornamentales que solo serv√≠an de decoraci√≥n pero suficientemente afiladas para atacar a alguien antes de romperse.Solamente los valientes caballeros que resistieron a sus ataques salvajes y su ira amarga lograron apresarla quit√°ndole su arma junto a cualquier otro objeto que pudiera usar en su contra.Pasar un d√≠a amarrada a su cama mediante cadenas de hierro y encerrada en su habitaci√≥n fue un regalo maravilloso su soledad le permiti√≥ pensar equilibrar las opciones dej√°ndola ir por la que siempre estaba presente y a veces solo a veces ignoraba.Su botellita especial segu√≠a oculta en ese joyero barato con sus alhajas. Poseer veneno mientras esta encarcelada por cr√≠menes en contra de toda una familia mon√°rquica no es exactamente el sello de aprobaci√≥n para la confianza.Apenas le quitaran ese grillete ir√≠a al joyero beber√≠a la botella y todo acabar√≠a.Sin embargo parec√≠a no aprender.

Segu√≠a cometiendo los mismos errores.√âl apareci√≥.Despu√©s de a√±os de no verse volvi√≥ con otra advertencia o m√°s bien el destino de su vida.Usted Definitivamente es est√∫pida. He gastado cinco a√±os en vigilarla cuidar que su identidad s mantenga secreta hasta el preciso momento de su liberaci√≥n. Y para qu√© Lastimar al personal Causar da√±os a la propiedad Atraer atenci√≥n innecesaria de las personas fuera de aqu√≠Estuvo tentada a preguntarle a que se refer√≠a con eso √∫ltimo. No la dej√≥ continuo con su rega√±o como si fuera una chiquilla berrinchuda. Y en verdad estaba molesta √©l la botar√≠a sin algo en que sostenerse. Vivi√≥ como una mujer de alta estirpe solo estirando su mano y recibiendo lo que se le daba los alimentos se le serv√≠an en un plato y su ropa estaba lista apenas pronunciaba una palabra. Ella jam√°s sobrevivir√° por su cuenta.Jam√°s aprender√° a ser bondadosa o amable. No importa las oportunidades que se le brinde seguir√° como una mujer de ruin coraz√≥n ego√≠sta y rastrera. Pensaba en tenerle consideraci√≥n al dar esa orden de mantenerla encerrada por cinco a√±os pero me equivoque. Solo han sido unas vacaciones para usted esperando el momento preciso para volver a sus viejas costumbres.Ella no entend√≠a a que se refer√≠a. Vacaciones Esperando el momentoAcababa de enterarse que ser√≠a echada a la calle. Qu√© tipo de comportamiento deb√≠a tener Y estos cinco a√±os encerrada han sido menos que placenteros. Las cuerdas rotas y los cuchillos extraviados escondidos debajo del tabl√≥n de madera en su armario lo probaban aparte de la botellita con el m√°gico elixir que tan amablemente su hija le proporciono en una muestra de generosidad.Prefiere callar que hablar verdad Es tan desagradable verla fingir ignorancia e inocencia no va a salvarla esta vez. Hemos terminado. Espero este preparada para lo que sigue.Sin una despedida √©l la dejo en su habitaci√≥n cerrando con llave. La √∫nica ofendida e indignada era ella paso cinco a√±os atormentada por los sirvientes aislada del mundo y en posesi√≥n de esa botella record√°ndole constantemente lo que deb√≠a hacer. Y por qu√© actu√≥ Qu√© la detuvoMiedo probablemente.Esperanza si claro como no.Ni ella sab√≠a porque continuaba viva tan solo no quer√≠a que acabara de esa forma obedeciendo a otra persona al presentarla su opci√≥n.Por una vez solo una vez quer√≠a vivir por s√≠ misma.Al tener dicha revelaci√≥n tom√≥ una nueva decisi√≥n respecto a la botellita.Camino al joyero encontrando el peque√±o objeto y sosteni√©ndolo entre sus dedos. Un sorbo y su vida tan miserable como la conoc√≠a acabar√≠a el sufrimiento y las humillaciones se esfumar√≠an el dolor se borrar√≠a.Y continuar√≠a dejando su vida en las manos de alguien m√°s.No No lo permitiriaCon su nueva convicci√≥n ardiendo en su alma camino hasta la ventana que daba al balc√≥n sujeto el florero y rompi√≥ la ventana quitando el seguro del exterior y saliendo.El horizonte se extend√≠a ante ella. M√°s all√° de la alta muralla le esperaba la ciudad del Reino de Lisa un amplio cielo nublado que pronosticaba una fuerte lluvia era hermoso a sus ojos perfecto y √∫nico. Sonri√≥. Cerrando su mano alrededor de la botellita adopt√≥ la posici√≥n de un lanzador de b√©isbol levanto un poco la pierna tomando impulso y usando la otra mano como un guante posiciono la mira de su objetivo. Directo al √°rbol con los rosales a un lado ah√≠ se romper√≠a el frasquito y seria su primera decisi√≥n.Qu√© importaba si la echaban de la lujosa mansi√≥n Si ya no hab√≠a vestidos dise√±ados exclusivamente Un mont√≥n de sirvientes O comida preparada por elegantes chefsElla ten√≠a algo que ning√∫n otro individuo pose√≠a la opci√≥n de decidir de dirigir su vida a su gusto sin pensar en que sea adecuado para alguien m√°s para impresionar a un tercero para ganar poder para colocarse por encima de todos. Solamente vivir√° para ella y por ella. Nadie importaba m√°s que ella misma.Y hab√≠a tardado cinco a√±os y una muerte en ese instante para entenderlo.No soy infantil solamente maduro a un nivel diferente que el resto. Lanzo el frasco quebr√°ndose en alg√∫n lugar del jard√≠n. Si alguien se cortaba o medio envenenaba no era su culpa. Ella no ten√≠a esa cosa por gusto.Bondadosa y amable no Oh querido Marqu√©s t√∫ hija no es ni jam√°s fue algo de eso. Solo una peque√±a perra controladora ella tampoco cambio solo se volvi√≥ m√°s astuta. Regresando a su habitaci√≥n se encontr√≥ con el guardia en turno que hab√≠a entrado al escuchar el romper del vidrio de su ventana. Lo saludo casualmente y despu√©s fue a recostarse en su cama inform√°ndole que tomar√≠a una siesta. Sin dejar al desconcertado hombre procesar la informaci√≥n quito las cobijas y sabanas procediendo a ponerse c√≥moda y dormir.Al despertar pensar√≠a en la forma de ganar dinero que no involucrara ser una prostituta o casarse con alg√∫n viejo rico y pervertido. El Reino de Lisa deb√≠a tener mejores oportunidades de subsistencia para los plebeyos que el glorificado Imperio de Castina.Tras romper una ventana arrojar veneno y dormir unas ocho maravillosas horas de sue√±o supo a lo que se refer√≠a el Marques con las personas del exterior y oportunidades. Aparentemente hab√≠an surgido rumores sobre la presencia de una mujer de blanco que se ocultaba en una mansi√≥n muy pocas personas eran capaces de verla desde un balc√≥n que pod√≠a mirarse a cierta distancia de la muralla. El misterio m√°s jugoso desde que la Princesa de Lisa fue enviada como candidata a prometida estando embarazada. Por ello cuando se escucharon sus gritos y alboroto la gente no reparo en creer que la mujer de blanco estaba siendo agredida y usada por alg√∫n malvado hombre que la manten√≠a prisionera o solo usaron el pretexto para conseguir que saliera y conocerla directamente.Algunos caballeros fueron enviados para escuchar las explicaciones del administrador y y√©ndose poco satisfechos con la promesa de volver y hablar con el due√±o directo del edificio se le llamo al Marqu√©s para que se hiciera cargo lo dem√°s es innecesario de mencionar solo hubo mucho dinero involucrado y unas cuantas amenazas.Le dieron un par de maletas con ropa de plebeya y una habitaci√≥n semidecente en uno de los edificios de viviendas compartidos de la clase menos pobre del Reino de Lisa y alejada de la locaci√≥n en que estuvo viviendo. Recibi√≥ a lo mucho un par de bolsas con dinero una carta que ni se molest√≥ en leer y la m√°s escueta de las despedidas. Ella pudo quedarse con la mansi√≥n y nuevos trabajadores recibiendo un poco de dinero mediante un negocio que inicio el Marqu√©s y se le ceder√≠a mientras el administrador le ense√±aba su funcionamiento. Lo cual no paso debido a sus acciones. Ese bastardo lo planeo todo. Pens√≥ al ingresar a su nuevo hogar y buscando un escondite para su dinero de subsistencia hasta encontrar trabajo. Una reuni√≥n de empleados solo para cerrar el trabajo encomendado por el Marqu√©s. Ja Quer√≠a echarme y quedarse con las jugosas ganancias. Realmente soy tan f√°cil de manipular.Guardo el dinero entre telas viejas y algo de tierra empez√≥ a ordenar sus pocas pertenencias en los muebles sopesando la distancia entre su nuevo hogar y las casas de nobles adem√°s de los lugares que serv√≠an alojamiento o comida en los siguientes pueblos. Pasos peque√±os si iba dando pasos peque√±os sin desesperarse se costear√≠a su vida humilde sencilla y c√≥moda sin arriesgar su cuello o su virginidad intacta.Escucho su est√≥mago gru√±ir cortando el ambiente tenso creado por sus pensamientos. Neg√≥ de un lado a otro palmeando su vientre plano. Esperaba todav√≠a saber c√≥mo encender una estufa o sino se la pasar√≠a llen√°ndose de pan fruta y mermelada. Lo cual en definitiva no era saludable.Con unas pocas monedas sacadas de su escondite cerr√≥ la puerta de su nuevo hogar. Ir√≠a a buscar el mercado.En verdad te lo agradezcoExclamo la joven de cabello rosado abrazando a la anciana mujer canosa que luchaba por no ser aplastada entre tal muestra de afecto sincero.Eres la mejor. Simplemente la mejor. C√≥mo supiste que esa combinaci√≥n funcionaria Tienes alg√∫n secreto O caso posees poderes m√°gicosA√±os de pr√°ctica. Por supuesto que los tengo. Si no mal recuerdo la magia desapareci√≥ cuando un idiota ignorante con mucho dinero y muchas mujeres desgasto el potencial m√°gico de un erudito muy sabio. Respondi√≥ la anciana separ√°ndose del agarre de la joven y volviendo detr√°s del mostrador de su peque√±a tienda de hierbas.La joven rio divertida por el humor agrio de la mujer. La conoc√≠a desde su infancia a causa de su madre que era una fiel clienta en su juventud al ayudarla con su enfermedad mediante esos medicamentos prohibidos por la medicina real y las bendiciones de las ra√≠ces. A pesar de las constantes advertencias las ordenes reales y las visitas de algunas ra√≠ces ella no se amedrentaba ni se rend√≠a. La firmeza en su resoluci√≥n fue objeto de admiraci√≥n logrando que las personas del pueblo donde coloco su humilde negocio se unieran y crearan una insignificante guerrilla por la independencia m√©dica. La batalla que divertida a los nobles y era causa de chistes malos pronto se volvi√≥ un movimiento completo que atrajo a muchas personas a conocer a la misteriosa curandera que aterraba a la familia real y compet√≠a contra las ra√≠ces. Describir m√°s all√° este momento hist√≥rico har√≠a que entrara en muchos detalles desde lo pol√≠tico hasta lo militar. Los puntos clave en que se resume este conflicto fue no solo alcanzar la independencia medica como se planteaba al inicio sino crear toda una ciudad separada del Reino y considerada tierra neutral ajena a las creencias del templo de Vita y la monarqu√≠a. Se estableci√≥ un L√≠der principal y un consejo entre quienes se encontraba la curandera manteniendo su posici√≥n aun en su vejez y cuando tanto el L√≠der principal y otros miembros hab√≠an cambiado en el pasar de los a√±os.Ella era la mujer m√°s respetada y querida.Abuela Jun. Sin ti mi perro ahora estar√≠a muerto. Dijo la joven de cabello rosado secando unas cuantas l√°grimas escapando de sus ojos. Tomando la mano de la anciana le obsequio una c√°ndida sonrisa. Vendr√°s a cenar hoy Quiero que conozcas a mi prometidoPrometido Dijo sorprendida levantando una ceja.S√≠. Es un chico muy guapo y educado viene de los pueblos de la frontera de Castina. Era granjero pero ahora est√° entrenando para volver uno de nuestros guardias exteriores. Por qu√© te quieres casar si esta en medio de su aprendizaje Tendr√≠as que trabajar y atender la casa tu sola.Supongo que s√≠ Por eso es que solo es mi prometido. Le dije que nos casar√≠amos hasta que tuviera un trabajo fijo y por supuesto recibir la aprobaci√≥n de mi querida abuela Jun.Y yo que tengo que ver Soy solo una anciana que prepara medicinas herbales.Claro que no. Era la Consejera principal de la ciudad Fundadora del orfanato para hu√©rfanos de guerra Y la maestra principal en la secci√≥n de hierbas y flora de la escuela de medicina C√≥mo debatir√≠a la opini√≥n de una mujer tan culta y genial como t√∫ Primero gracias por el cumplido. Segundo no necesitas mi opini√≥n eres capaz de ver si ese chico te conviene o no. Y en tercero solo quieres que lo ponga nervioso porque seguramente tus padres lo aprobaron.Jejeje. Me atrapaste. S√≠. √âl es taaaan encantador se gan√≥ a mis padres muy r√°pido. Quer√≠a verlo sonrojarse y tropezar con sus palabras como yo cuando conoc√≠ a sus padres. Eso es injusto.Lo injusto es que quieras usar a una anciana como yo.Eso es un noEs un iras a tus clases del a√±o restante y vendr√°s a ayudarme en la tienda a cambio de seguir tu juego rid√≠culo.S√≠ Te amo abuela JunAja aja. Ya su√©ltame ni√±a. Ahora vete a tu casa. Si quieres que llegue temprano d√©jame acabar con mi inventario. A sus √≥rdenes Te espero a las siete de la noche. √âl llegara una hora despu√©s. Nos vemos abuela JunAgito su mano despidi√©ndose de la emocionada muchachita que corr√≠a a casa. La anciana canosa contin√∫o trabajando en marcar las palabras en su lista deteni√©ndose √∫nicamente para escribir en una segunda lista los materiales que deb√≠a reabastecer.Su tienda comenz√≥ en una choza con un agujero en el techo y algunas alima√±as ratas serpientes e insectos que elimino ferozmente. Los primeros clientes tardaron en llegar cuando lo hicieron sus caras ten√≠an el temor impresos la duda y una min√∫scula esperanza de encontrar la cura adecuada para las enfermedades o males que los atormentaba. Con cada √©xito por mera suerte o sus conocimientos adquiridos de una educaci√≥n practicate√≥rica consigui√≥ la confianza de los residentes del pueblo y extender el nombre de su negocio. No tardo en tener suficiente dinero para reparar correctamente esa choza tener tres comidas completas al d√≠a y conseguir nuevas ropas. Paso un infierno por cada trabajo en el que estuvo tras ser despojada de su lujosa c√°rcel.Jefes compa√±eros de trabajo y clientes dispuestos a violarla o abusar sexualmente de ella a la m√≠nima oportunidad. Interpretar√≠an su amabilidad o servicio al cliente como una invitaci√≥n a un avance sexual o el inter√©s de un cortejo que se traduc√≠a en un r√°pido encuentro detr√°s de las cajas de suministros. Estuvo aterrada e impotente las primeras ocasiones su cuerpo temblando dando pasos pesados alej√°ndose del cuerpo inconsciente del amable jefe que le ofreci√≥ un cuarto de su compa√±ero que era su mejor amigos del cliente que le dejo una gran propina. Todos esos hombres asquerosos recibieron su merecido no le importo si viv√≠an o mor√≠an ella simplemente corri√≥ sin mirar atr√°s. Seguramente habr√≠a algunos carteles busc√°ndola o jam√°s levantaron la denuncia. Podr√≠a ser humillante explicar c√≥mo una mujer tuvo la fuerza necesaria para incapacitarlos y robarles porque obviamente no se ir√≠a solamente asustada con la seguridad de proteger su virginidad e integridad f√≠sica tomar√≠a cualquier objeto de valor y dinero como una merecida compensaci√≥n por la apresurada renuncia y los da√±os a su persona. Sin la existencia de los derechos humanos en ese mundo parec√≠a valer la ley del mundo animal solo sobrevive el m√°s fuerte o al menos as√≠ actuaban las personas pertenecientes al estrato plebeyo a diferencia de los nobles con sus manuales de modales leyes y otras regulaciones que solo aplicaban para ellos y solo las implementaban con los plebeyos al impartir castigos o cobrar de impuestos.Esa sociedad estaba podrida.Si debi√≥ agradecerle o no al Marqu√©s por arrojarla al mundo real lo pensar√≠a un poco. A diferencia de su adorada hija ese hombre era mucho m√°s sincero con lo que resguardaba su coraz√≥n.Entre sus repugnantes trabajos hubo algunos decentes que le permitieron volverse una mujer m√°s culta de lo que la sociedad noble necesitaba a conveniencia. Consigui√≥ un puesto en una vieja librer√≠a de segunda mano a la cual solo asist√≠an nuevos nobles o nobles con un inter√©s peculiar por libros muy viejos. El due√±o era hombre anciano viudo casi ciego y restringido en su movilidad aparentemente fue algo como un mercenario o caza recompensas despu√©s de un trabajo en el que estuvo a punto de morir eligi√≥ retirarse y ser solo un ciudadano com√∫n y corriente eso hizo feliz a su esposa y le brindo tranquilidad los siguientes a√±os hasta su muerte.El trabajo dentro de la librer√≠a principalmente era la limpieza ordenar y clasificar los libros aparte de ayudar al hombre a servirle la comida y pasarle sus medicamentos. Convirti√©ndose en su cuidadora a tiempo completo ya que el anciano le otorgo vivienda en la habitaci√≥n de hu√©spedes del segundo piso. C√≥mo podr√≠a quejarse Le soluciono la vida y solamente deb√≠a atender a un hombre con un pie en la tumba y limpiar el polvo de libros antiguos. Casi parec√≠a una trampa y en cualquier segundo seria llevada a un prost√≠bulo o convertida en esclava.Dos meses despu√©s estaba completamente segura de que el anciano era inofensivo y su trabajo decente.Para no aburrirse entre los tiempos de siestas y poca clientela comenz√≥ a leer algunos de los libros encontrando ejemplares interesantes muy distintos a los aburridos textos que le pasaban en sus lecciones de etiqueta y otras materias para ser una Emperatriz. Pronto su mente estuvo llena de conocimientos medicinales herbolarios venenos infusiones una cantidad de saber con el cual podr√≠a volverse un excelente m√©dico de ese mundo. Fue ah√≠ cuando una idea se plasm√≥ algo en lo que no hab√≠a pensado jam√°s ni siquiera en su hogar.Cu√°l era su aspiraci√≥nEn casa solamente cumpl√≠a con el est√°ndar en sus clases tomaba apuntes repasaba sus lecciones presentaba los ex√°menes y volv√≠a de la escuela por su camino diario. Sal√≠a muy poco y las reuniones con otros compa√±eros de sal√≥n eran contadas. Ni siquiera se comunicaba con alguien usando su celular simplemente se perd√≠a entre los anuncios las series o los juegos que pod√≠a descargar. La mayor interacci√≥n social que ten√≠a era por parte de su hermana menor Jisoo cuando le relataba detalladamente alguna de sus novelas y juraba conseguir el pr√≥ximo volumen aunque eso le costara perder su dinero del siguiente mes o hacer las tareas de sus compa√±eros para tener un extra. Con respecto a sus padres Su pap√° le√≠a el peri√≥dico todas las ma√±anas si deb√≠a entablar una conversaci√≥n con ella se limitaba a la escuela sus tareas o si ten√≠a que comprar alg√∫n material nuevo le sub√≠a a veces el dinero mensual si ten√≠a un mejor desempe√±o en sus calificaciones y le obsequiaba algunos dulces que recib√≠a en la oficina. Ellos no eran cercanos pero tampoco indiferentes solo una t√≠pica relaci√≥n de padre e hija. En cambio su mam√° ella parec√≠a una mujer tan brillante y positiva que muchas veces se cuestionaba sino sonre√≠a demasiado para su edad y su cabeza estaba llena de demasiado sue√±os y no plantaba los pies sobre la tierra. Continuamente la animaba e impulsaba cuando la temporada de ex√°menes se acercaba o ten√≠a una tarea particularmente dif√≠cil. Siempre siempre demostr√≥ fe en sus capacidades e inteligencia como si supiera de antemano que triunfar√≠a en todo lo que se propusiese. Asegur√°ndose en record√°rselo cada d√≠a. Escucharla le daba un peque√±o impulso para esforzarse en la escuela.Quiz√°s Si su mam√° hubiera estado presente la primera vez. Habr√≠a analizado lo de ser Emperatriz juzgar los deberes y clases a los que ser√≠a sometida los tipos de relaciones que se manejaban y como se divid√≠a el poder entre los nobles. Tan solo ten√≠a diecis√©is a√±os todav√≠a no sab√≠a si quiera ir a la Universidad o estudiar una especialidad. Por qu√© esperaban que liderara toda una naci√≥nDaba igual pensar en la respuesta a esa pregunta. Era una posibilidad inexistente de un pasado al que ya no necesitaba aferrarse. Se concentrar√≠a en su presente e imaginaria su futuro.S√≠ un futuro.La palabra se sent√≠a muy agradable en sus labios al pronunciarla. La lleno de una pasi√≥n ardiente haciendo del libro polvoriento a punto de romperse m√°s valioso que el oro y las joyas.Los pelda√±os en que construir√≠a su porvenir.Un m√©dico. O lo m√°s parecido sin una educaci√≥n formal y con escases en ciertos conocimientos m√°s avanzados.Curandera o herborista podr√≠an ser mejores t√©rminos bruja o hechizara los dejaba fuera no quer√≠a ser quemada en una hoguera.Y tras un esfuerzo constante probando diferentes combinaciones haciendo practicas con algunos animales insectos y cad√°veres se hizo una experta en su campo aparte de ganarse el odio de los creyentes de Vita las ra√≠ces y algunos cuantos m√©dicos.Recibi√≥ amenazas y advertencias hasta ser citada en una audiencia por el propio Rey de Lisa a pedido del Emperador de Castina y el L√≠der del Templo Tertius en un intento de convencerla en detener sus transgresiones y recibir un perd√≥n considerando el darle alg√∫n tipo de compensaci√≥n por sus poderosos brebajes. Si su edad fuera tan joven como su apariencia la delataba aceptar√≠a la jugosa cantidad y los t√≠tulos pero ella pod√≠a ver a trav√©s de ese camuflaje solo quer√≠an que se detuviera de darles una segunda opci√≥n a los plebeyos de extender su conocimiento de ser una persona con libre albedrio que pod√≠a avanzar y lograr la independencia. Obviamente los mando al diablo admitiendo su rechazo a la fe religiosa y la monarqu√≠a.La perdonaron d√°ndole tiempo para pensar reflexionar y tomar la decisi√≥n correcta.O enserio que eran est√∫pidos confiados. Jam√°s debieron de darle una segunda oportunidad. En cuanto tuvo un pie de regreso en el pueblo y se preparaba para una vida de pr√≥fuga la guerra por la separaci√≥n del Reino de Lisa comenz√≥.Hace cu√°nto de esoSesenta a√±os SetentaA veces su edad avanzada afectaba su mente en cuanto al tiempo m√°s no a sus medicamentos y trabajo diario. Parecer√≠a senil y todav√≠a pod√≠a nombrar de memoria los ingredientes necesarios para el simple jarabe de tos que creo en sus primeros d√≠as.Cerrando un cuaderno a medio coser con la lista de su inventario y la reposici√≥n de materiales lo guardo en un caj√≥n detr√°s del aparador. Ir√≠a a prepararse para la cena acordarse de su edad significaba que ya no era tan √°gil al momento de cambiar su vestimenta y peinar su cabello. No necesitaba llegar retrasada para escuchar las quejas de esa muchachita que la llamaba afectuosamente abuela Jun.Ella misma ya no era una chiquilla con el car√°cter alborotado de imponer su opini√≥n. Solo una anciana com√∫n y corriente con un mal temperamento y chistes desagradables que quer√≠a pasar sus √∫ltimos a√±os trabajando en el mostrador de su tienda jubilarse de maestra y ceder su asiento en el consejo a la pr√≥xima generaci√≥n.No fue una vida gloriosa de cuento de hadas con un final feliz pero fue una buena vida su vida. Justo como ella la creo.HmDe que muri√≥Alguien realmente podr√≠a estar interesadoQu√© importaba la muerte de una simple ancianaS√≠ hubo muchas l√°grimas se maldijo en el nombre del ser omnipresente que exist√≠a en una sola religi√≥n y una investigaci√≥n inicio encontrando varios esp√≠as de los Reinos vecinos e incluido el Imperio. M√°s no pruebas de un plan para asesinar a la anciana mujer en su mayor momento de debilidad.√önicamente se trat√≥ del tiempo. Concluir el ciclo vital en el mundo terrenal y permitir avanzar a su alma al siguiente nivel proseguir con la rueca de la reencarnaci√≥n o volverse uno con el todo.Ella recordaba bastante bien lo √∫ltimo que hizo antes de sentirse extremadamente cansada y dormir. Fue a la cena molesto un poco al joven prometido de aquella ni√±a tramito sus papeles para su jubilaci√≥n de maestra y miembro del consejo. Sigui√≥ trabajando diligentemente y completo unos cuantos pedidos. Y por la ma√±ana de cierto d√≠a ya no tuvo la fuerza ni el deseo de levantarse disfruto de la calidez de sus sabanas y cobijas el sonido de los p√°jaros cantando el bullicio de la ciudad y el agradable clima sumi√©ndose en un sue√±o del que no despertar√≠a jam√°s.Y esa paz absoluta le duro cinco segundos m√°ximos. Como dije este es un fic totalmente autoindulgente. Con una historia un poco m√°s oscura de lo que suelo escribir. Agregando un peculiar elemento como lo es un ciclo de regresi√≥n sin final. Me sent√≠ inspirada por un fanfic que utiliza este concepto del bucle de tiempo porque hizo que tuviera un incre√≠ble desarrollo el personaje ca√≠ y volv√≠a a levantarse la desesperanza la angustia el miedo la posibilidad de cambiar y conocerse a s√≠ mismo. Fue incre√≠ble. Dudo mucho que lleve a Jieun por el camino de la madurez o el autoconocimiento para que digamos oh que buena persona. La planteo como alguien que ya est√° rota termina por quebrarse a√∫n m√°s y de entre esos trozos trata de levantarse y encontrar su fuerza. Autodescubrimiento Nah no creo que sea tan buena para expresar eso en este fanfic. En fin probablemente me pase un poco en algunas partes de la historia. Si ya se Lo que acaban de leer fue lo suavecito Yo creo Por lo cual la historia seguir√° siendo solo para lectores mayores de edad y en caso de que no te sientas c√≥modo leyendo de este tipo de temas te recomiendo que te abstengas de leer y esperes por alg√∫n otro de mis trabajos que son dirigidos para todo p√∫blico. Y s√≠ tengo otro fic autoindulgente a la espera uno m√°s bonito. Planeaba que esto fuera un capitulo √∫nico pero la extensi√≥n ya casi llega a los 10k de palabras y apenas va por la mitad de la historia entonces Wii cap√≠tulos divididos Aproximadamente ser√°n cuatro sino me fallan las cuentas. El final ya lo tengo bien planeado. Justo para cerrar con broche de oro. Muchas gracias por pasar a este peque√±o rinc√≥n autoindulgente.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/41559654,"she's a woman, not some soil",She stood rigid underneath the stares and scrutiny of the nobles around her. Whispering about how the Emperor had made a wise choice in discarding her as Empress Candidate and choosing another woman.Today is the eve of Ruve and Jieuns wedding and people are again criticizing Aristia La Monique. For not being able to bear a child. For being too headstrong. For her choice to go down the path of a Knight. She looks up at Carsein at her side a thousand emotions warring beneath her calm fa√ßade.Does the last offer still stands They kiss ravenously like animals in rut. Or more likely this is the kind of passion which Aristia instigates for she will not accept anything less.There is a deep anger running in an undercurrent of her actions a ferocity to her touches which speaks of a wounded beast pride worn down. Carsein guesses this is the price for her ability to stand tall beneath all the accusations and gossips.He makes a motion that speaks of his closeness using all of his strength to stop their motion together and gritting out a choked Stop. Stop this before you make me do something I will regret.Come inside Aristia breathes lips twisted savagely into a smile. Not like it will matter. Oh but it did. It did matter two months to come and Aristia sits in his familys reception hall palm of her hand placed protectively over her belly.Sein She greets airy and unconcerned. It seems that it did matter.,Mature,InfertilityImplied Sexual ContentCrack
https://archiveofourown.org/works/36690616,The Disowned Princess,Queen Aristia la Monique laid on her bed after her father left to help her get out of the Castina Palace. It had only been a day since then. However a day felt like years to her. Aristia had to put her work aside because she was feeling nauseous recently. She thought it was because of the miscarriage but from what the doctor told her it should be similar to her period cycle. With a groan Aristia got up from bed pacing back and forth. Usually whenever shes on her cycle she would get cramps but that was about it. However these symptoms were different. It was similar to when she was pregnant. She kept vomiting and feeling nauseous. Her chest felt a bit swollen too. These symptoms bothered her not in a bad way.Could it be She thought hopefully. The thought of still being pregnant crept up in her mind but soon disappeared. Aristia shook her head. No it couldnt be. She saw the blood. There was so much blood that there was no way her child couldve survive. The royal doctors even told her that she lost the child. What if they miscalculated As much as Aristia wanted to go to the royal doctor but that was too risky. The royal doctor wouldve tell Emperor Ruveliss if she was still with child.Suddenly the door burst opened revealing Emperor Ruveliss. Aristias eyes widened as she turned pale. Why was he here What did she even do this time She just had a miscarriage and was still healing and he had the audacity to barge into her chambers like a madmanSlowly Aristia got up and bowed to her husband. Welcome Your Majesty the sole sun of the Empire.Emperor Ruveliss grabbed a fistful of her hair and slapped her across the face. Aristia wanted to tell him to stop but she was afraid that if she did he might hurt her even more. She still kept her composure and made sure she didnt show a slight of agony.Tsk look at you Emperor Ruveliss hissed. Even when I did this to you you still show no emotion. You really are indeed an ice queen.Is there something you need Your Majesty Aristia asked.Why arent you doing your work he let go of her hair. Jieun cant do her work because shes with child.For once Aristia wanted to laugh in front of Emperor Ruvelisss face. Since when did that became a rule The past Empress and Queens who bare the Emperors child still had to work. Its only when they get closer for their due date was when they take time off from their work. However despite Aristia desperately wanting to tell Emperor Ruveliss that but she needed to be calm or else he might hit her again. If only she knew how to wield a sword she wouldnt hesitate to slice him.I apologized Your Majesty Aristia said. I am still recovering from my miscarriage. I will continue to do the work tomorrow. Please send all of the paperwork to me and I will start them in the earliest hour.Emperor Ruveliss scoffed. Fine. After that I dont want to see you take anymore sick days. A person like you should never take any sick days.Yes Your Majesty.Then Emperor Ruveliss left slamming the door behind him. As much as Aristia really wanted to throw a vase at the emperor but she knew she couldnt. Besides from what she learned on training to be the empress if the empress emperor or queen are very ill someone in the palace would have to take over for the time being. Something that Emperor Ruveliss seemed to forget.When Aristia was about to go over to her bed her head spun and her stomach twist. Right away Aristia raced into her bathroom and threw up. She coughed a few times and wiped her mouth with a handkerchief. As soon as she finished Aristia slowly got to her bed and laid down. The comfort of her bed finally made her feel better.Aristia sighed and placed a hand on her belly as she whispered to herself. Am I still pregnantOoOWhen nightfall came Aristia snuck out of the palace wearing commoners clothing. A simple white blouse with a grey skirt and a black apron. Aristia had her beautiful long silver hair in a bun. She even had a cloak to hide more of her appearance. Aristia didnt need to tell anyone that she was sneaking out. She knew all of the ins and outs of the palace as well as the secret passages. She knew of these things since she stayed at the palace when she was sixteen. As Aristia got to the royal stables she took a horse and rode off into town. Luckily for her she knew how to ride a horse since many of the noble women would do horseback riding as a hobby. She had to learn how to ride a horse for her Empress studies.The time Aristia got to her destination she got off of her horse. This must be the place she thought. The building was a simple commoners building with a sign that said Asclepius. Aristia knew who Doctor Asclepius was. He was a famous doctor among both commoners and nobles alike. He was offered to be a royal doctor but turned it down since he wanted to be a doctor for all people not just for the royal. His wife Gwendolyn is also a doctor was well and worked as a midwife for women. Walking up to the building she knocked on the door.Yes yes Im coming a voice spoke through the door.Aristia shifted her feet a bit. She couldnt help it but be anxious. Then the door opened revealing a young man in his early thirties. He had glasses and a slight stubbled on his chin. He blinked a few times as if he was expecting something else than a lone woman.Oh good evening miss Doctor Asclepius said. How could I be at your serviceIm not feeling well Aristia simply explained. Will you please check if Im okay My name is Jeremiah.It was the only name Aristia could come up with. Even though Aristia knew a lot of female names but for some reason her late mothers name just popped up. She hoped to Vita that her mother didnt mind using her name as a disguise. Sadly Aristia didnt had those magic rings that could change ones appearance. Not many nobles had magical items and Aristia needed to see Doctor Asclepius despite how risky it is. However it was the risk shell take.Doctor Asclepius nodded. Of course Please this way miss.Oh another visitor Doctor Asclepius wife Gwendolyn spoke.I apologized for coming this late Aristia apologized. It is an emergency.Gwendolyn giggled. Dont worry miss. Its perfectly fine. Youre not the only woman to go here at night. Its perfectly understandable. Aristia couldnt helped it and smile. For the first time in her life someone was actually kind to her. Of course there was Jieun but every time Aristia did attempt to reciprocate her kindness or at least form a connection but it backfired.The doctor gestured her to sit down and Aristia did as she was told. It didnt took long for the doctor to ask her about the symptoms she was having as well as everything else that was of concern. He even performed some tests on her. Even Gwendolyn proposed they should do a second test and maybe a third test just to be safe which the doctor agreed. When the tests were done Doctor Asclepius and Gwendolyn where with Aristia. as the couple went over the test results. The couple was slightly confused at first. They even checked the other three tests that Gwendolyn insisted to be done. The doctors muttered among each other. They voices were a mixture of confusion and surprised.Is...everything okay Aristia asked.Miss Jeremiah Doctor Asclepius answered. Youre still pregnant.Aristia blinked. PardonThere was no way Aristia was still pregnant. She remembered it very clearly what happened. She collapsed on the ground and her body was in pain. She saw the blood. Lots and lots of blood. Emperor Ruveliss ordered someone to get the royal doctor and abandoned her to comfort Jieun. Was this really true Was her child still alive in herGwendolyn nodded. Correct you are still pregnant. Ive been pregnant before Miss Jeremiah and the results are saying youre positively pregnant.HHow Aristia exclaimed. II saw the blood There was so much blood My doctor I had told me I lost my childYou just had a heavy spotting Miss Jeremiah Doctor Asclepius explained. It is common that doctors can misdiagnosed a miscarriage. You are indeed still pregnant. I recommend not to overwork yourself and not be too stress since it isnt healthy for you and the baby.Tears filled in Aristias golden eyes as she cried happily. She thanked the couple and embraced them into a hug. Aristia hadnt hugged anyone in a long time. When was the last time she ever hugged someone Was it her mother Or father Aristia touched her belly stroking it softly. Her child Her child was still alive She never lost her child at allThank you Aristia cried. Thank you so muchDoctor Asclepius chuckled. Its nothing Miss Jeremiah. Its what we do.Aristia thanked them again and paid them well as they deserved. She was sure theyll figured it out that shes a noble but she didnt care. All she was happy that her child is alive. As Aristia left the doctors home and got onto her horse a dawn of realization sunk in. She went pale as she realized that her child would be born in the palace with Emperor Ruveliss Empress Jieun and the heir. Not only that her child will suffer just like her. She remembered what Emperor Ruveliss said clearly. He never cared for their child. No matter how intelligent they are they would never be crowned as the future heir of the Castina Empire. He already disowned them without getting to know them. There was no way Aristia would let her child have that fate. She will make sure her child will grow up with love.Then Aristia caressed her belly. Everything will be fine my little one.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/17861486,Long Live the Empress,The Castina Empire is the only empire on this continent and has a proud history that began more than thousands of years ago. However it has been declining due to 32nd Emperors ups and downs but thanks to the 33rd emperor Mirkan Lu Shana the Empire began to bloom again.Charismatic with a sunny disposition... The 33rd Emperor who was perfect in every way and ruled with generosity and the good of his people in mind. He could have anything he would ever want with a snap of his fingers...except for one thing.He could not make an heir apparent appear out of thin air.Due to the Empires emphasis on bloodlines if the Emperor passed without a blood heir the Empire would fall into chaos due to confusion in succession. As the Emperor grew wearier and the nobles fought amongst themselves fights which grew fiercer as time passed he was finally blessed with a child Prince Ruveliss Kamaludin Shana Castina was born to the cheers and elation of the citizens. His name meant in the Gods language he who will bring glory to a new morning. Although with the Princes birth another problem arose. He was born too late. There were no daughters belonging to a noble house around his age. The Empress according to the law of the Empire must be chosen from at least a Marquis house or higher but by the time the Prince was born the youngest eligible lady was already ten. It was much too big an age gap.Although there were nobles who were having children no daughters were born to any of the eligible noble houses. Discussions began with the Emperor to perhaps change the law but then a prophecy was foretold about the future Empress. The prophecy proclaimed by the Oracle said a girl would soon be born who would become the Princes betrothed. If they were to wed the Empire was to be blessed upon their union.After four years passed with the exception to the Duchy household the only girl that was born to a noble house with a title of at least a Marquis was Aristia La Monique daughter of Marquis and Marchioness La Monique. She was born with silver hair like her father that seemed to be bestowed upon her from the moonlight itself. Her golden eyes were filled with the warmth of the sun much like her mothers. There was no doubt in the peoples mind that she was the one mentioned in the prophecy as her family was the only Marquis family to contribute to the Empires founding. As soon as she was able to walk her training to become future Empress began. She was left with no freedom to act as a child she was a future Empress and would have to act as one.Around the time the Crown Prince was 21 Emperor Mirkan passed away and the Prince became the 34th Emperor. Aristia waited knowing she would soon be wed to Ruveliss and become the 34th Empress. But before that happened on the year that Ruveliss was 21 and Aristia was 16 a mysterious girl appeared at the royal pond. Her hair was as black as obsidian with equally dark eyes and she wore strange clothes. It became clear that she was from another world.With the mysterious girls sudden appearance the temple was thrown into chaos as the girl and the Emperor grew close in what seemed to be mere moments. Upon the reveal of the girls birth date it was discovered she was born before Aristia. The Oracle who interpreted the prophecy years ago came forward with a new interpretation.One that claimed the mysterious girl to be the Emperors true partner.The mysterious girl was immediately hailed as the Empress and Aristia was forgotten by the people.On the day the Empire came to congratulate the new Emperors coronation the day Aristia had once looked forward to as she would have become the Empress who would stand by his side. Ruveliss was always so cold towards her despite their betrothal but despite that Aristia fell in love with him and counted down the days of when they would be wed with flower petals in what little spare time she had. She had always hoped that his heart would soften and grow to love her upon their marriage but that dream was shattered on this day.He who was always so cold to her was smiling warmly towards the mysterious girl as they held each others hands in sheer bliss as they received their crowns amongst cheers.Long live the Emperor Long live the EmpressThey look so happy Truly a match made in heavenIndeed. Now that the Emperor has met his Empress the Empire will prosperAristia who was raised from birth to be Empress bowed her head as they received their congratulations unable to look at their cheery smiles which pained her heart. The newlyweds then headed towards the palace where she thought would have become her home.Perhaps due to his late fathers constant doting on Aristia the Emperor was...kind enough to take her in as a Queen or lesser wife who would help the Empress in her duties.Wow you have silver hair I didnt know people could be born with that color Its so pretty Whats your name The new Empress asked Aristia.Responding to the dear Empress Moon of the Empire I am Aristia La Monique. Greetings your majesty.Aristia Can I call you Tia My name is Jieun. She had a goofy grin on her face as she continued without even waiting for Aristia to respond Nobody here is around my age so I dont have any friends. This is great Nice to meet you Tia...I am honored your majesty... Aristia knew that among nobility only good friends can call each other by their given names. Moreover only family and lovers were supposed to call you by a nickname and Jieun was neither she wasnt even her friend...This mysterious girl...Jieun shouldve been taking etiquette lessons for the last six months and hasnt even grasped the most basic of etiquette.Its nice to meet you I hope we can be good friendsYes Your Majesty.Tia you have such a pretty face but it doesnt suit your stiff way of speaking Cant you just relax...I will obey your command Your Majesty.Obey Ughh this isnt a historical drama. Dont say stuff like that and just call me Jieun. Please Its uncomfortable when you talk to me the same way you talk to Ruvey.Aristia bit her lip. Doesnt she know how impolite it would be for her to refer to the empress in such a casual manner It was essential for the upper class to always be formal with each other in this strict imperial system. It was an unspoken rule strictly forced upon themAristia wouldve loved to tell her off but no...no.Dont behave indecently Aristia... She told herself Its not proper for a lady of your standing to be upset over this. She just needs more lessons...yes thats it. Shell learn in time...Tia would you like to go outside with meTo whereWell I wanna go outside the palace but I dont think the maids would let me go out alone. So lets go out on a stroll together. You can rightThe maids wont let youYeah. They take good care of me but do you know how scary they are And theyre older than me too and that makes it doubly uncomfortable. Thats why Id rather do things alone but they wont let me.Aristia had been hearing rumors lately about how the new Empress was overly benevolent. Jieun had apparently been dismissing the maids to allow them longer breaks and it touched the maids hearts so they vowed to take good care of her. Going by what Jieun just said though it wasnt out of kindness that she was dismissing them but rather annoyance.Theyre just worried about you... Aristia mumbled unable to stop the comment form slipping out. Suddenly Jieun looked at her vacantly. It was rather offputting...So can we go on our stroll nowYes Your Majesty...Wow this place is really pretty Upon arriving at the Emperors Garden Jieun giddily began to run around leaving Aristia behind.Aristia didnt really mind though. As soon as they arrived at the garden she was flooded with nostalgic memories. Memories of her childhood. They were such joyful memories that she couldnt be bothered to care if Jieun left her behind or not.Aristia slowly made her way to the center of the garden where a tall tree grows.As she placed a hand on the trees trunk particular time in the past arose in her mind. This was where Ruveliss and Aristia first met when she was ten and he was fifteen. The two would have many meetings in these gardens as time passed alongside the late Emperor. Although Ruveliss always did his best to try and ignore her during their meetings the late Emperor was much kinder.My dear girl... Late Emperor Mirkan would always call her so. The two would often stroll around the gardens together.But now Im visiting this place without him... Her eyes began to tear up. I truly believed I would become his sons wife and we would be happy together...Dear Emperor Mirkan...I miss you...She closed her eyes and let the memories of the kind late emperor sweep over her the same way the gentle breeze swept through the lush flower fields of the garden. But just these memories arent enough...I wish I could still see you and speak to you...I suppose that makes me too greedy though. Doesnt it Emperor Mirkan Tia are you okayYes Im fine. You dont have to worry about me Your Majesty. I was just remembering something dear to me.As Jieun made her way towards Aristia she stuck her her tongue out at her.Aristia wished she couldve hidden her emotions better...What was so dear that it made you cryI was just thinking of someone who was as dear to me as family unfortunately I will never see them again.Jieuns face suddenly fell she was no longer wearing the same mischievous face earlier. I see...I miss my own family too. I mean I was just suddenly dropped in this world after all. Thats right...Shes not from this world her majesty mustve left a family behind. And she left them behind while shes still rather young too. I believe shes only eighteen not much older than myself. Mom dad...I miss you. I even miss Jisoo and how he never listened to me. I want to see them again.She left her whole family behind...At least...I still have my father around even if we werent very close...Aristia began to feel pity for the poor girl and a sort of kinship.Your Ma She was about to do her best to comfort Jieun who began to cry but suddenly a familiar yet cold voice interrupted her.Whats going on here Ruveliss had appeared.Ruvey Jieun sobbed and ran into his arms.Jieun what happened Who made you cry He wrapped his arms around her.Aristia bit her lip. For sixteen years...sixteen long years...Ruveliss wouldnt even allow Aristia to hang around him within five feet of him much less call his name. But Jieun who hasnt even been in this world so long was able to run into his arms and call him by a cutesy nickname. Not even the nickname his family called him but a nickname Jieun made up herself.What did you do to Jieun What did you say to her that made her cry He threw Aristia an accusatory glare.Your...Majesty Aristia felt tears pricking at her eyes. Was it fair for him to jump to such conclusions just because she happened to be here while Jieun cried Aristia didnt do anything to his precious empress...No Ruvey Tia didnt do anything to me. I was just tearing up a bit because I miss my family.Oh I see. Jieun you must be tired. You should go back into the palace and have a rest. Ill stop by to be with you shortly. He gazed at her with warm eyes and spoke tenderly to her.Aristia clutched her heart. Ruveliss continued to watch Jieun as she retreated back towards the palace. He never looked at Aristia with such warmth in his eyes...he never spoke to her with that same tenderness...he never treated her with such kindness...After Jieuns figure completely disappeared from sight he turned his full attention to Aristia. There was no trace of any of the warmth in his eyes from before.You Im warning you.Your MajestyJieuns a pure and gentle lady unlike you. You are not worthy of interacting with someone like her. The likes of you shouldnt even dare to think about hanging around her so carelessly....Yes Your Majesty.Every word felt like a sharp knife being thrust into her heart.Did you think the crown of the Empress belonged to you It never belonged to you from the start it had always been Jieuns. The prophecy was merely misinterpreted. Someone like you will never be fit to become Empress....Im only going to let go of this situation this time. But if this happens again I will not forgive you....Yes Your Majesty...I will keep this in mind.Aristia lost the strength in her legs once Ruveliss left the garden. She fell to the ground still clutching her heart. Why do you hate me so much Ruveliss I did my best to earn your love...thats all I ever did. I did my best to become a lady who could support you through thick and thin...so why She finally burst into tears and sobbed all alone in the Emperors Gardens...Your Grace please take a look at these documents. A servant came into Aristias office with a bundle of documents.Are they urgent She asked as she continued to do the work still in front of her.Yes I was unable to find the Emperor and the Empress...well I was told not to bother her with these things. But these matters are of great importance. The bishop requires these to be looked at right away.Okay I understand. Place them on my desk youre free to leave. The servant bowed placed the documents on her desk as instructed and hurriedly left the office.Aristia put her pen down and picked up the newly dropped off documents.These documents were for urgent funding for the temple. No doubt it was due to their massive spending lately. She heaved a sigh. Aristia began to think if it wasnt for her the Empire would be broke by now. Not only was the Emperor beginning to shirk his work but the Empress who should be doing this work when the Emperor cannot isnt even required to do so. Ruveliss decided that these were matters Jieun shouldnt be bothered with with so all of the normal Empresss duties were given to the queen Aristia.Im sure thats the only reason he even took me as a lesser wife. Not because he wanted to honor Emperor Mirkan...but because he didnt want his precious Empress to do any of this. Aristia shook her head. Now wasnt the time to think about that though. She had to get through these documents.As Aristia picked up her pen Jieun burst into her office Oh Tia Im so sorry......It wasnt unusual for Jieun to bother Aristia like this. After their first meeting she has so convinced herself that Aristia was her dear friend who she could go see whenever she wanted regardless of whether Aristia was busy or not but this...Im afraid I dont understand Your Majesty. Why are you apologizingAristia could certainly think of a few things she would be apologizing for...Is it because Jieun finally realized how poor her etiquette is Or maybe its because she realized all of her work being pushed onto Aristia instead by her ever doting husbandWell.... Jieun fidgeted. I heard that you were supposed to be the Empress. I started hearing some maids saying that you were chosen as Ruveys future wife from the day you were born. But then I arrived and.. Im really sorry Did she just realize that now A bit slow with the news isnt she You dont need to apologize Your Majesty. Aristia flipped through the documents. We were simply foolish and the prophecy was misinterpreted.ProphecyThe God of this world had decided long ago who would stand by the Emperor. You are the one who prophecy foretold was His Majestys destined partner. Its only right that you are the Empress.God decided Personally I dont see whats so great about being an empress.Aristia stopped flipping through her documents. Her hands began to shake but this went unnoticed by Jieun who continued to speak.I fell into this world suddenly and didnt know anything about where I was. It was overwhelming when everyone around me started talking about an oracle and prophecy and marriage. I didnt know how to go back home I dont even know if I can I didnt have much of a choice so I just...went along with it.But now I find out that Ruvey already had a fiance Its not like I wanted this to happen And doesnt this make me seem like some sort of villainous from a novel I dont want that I dont want to be Empress All I want is to go homeAristia slammed the documents onto her desk and stood up. She couldnt believe this How...how incredibly frustratingAre you done...TiaI am simply shocked by how irresponsible you sound right now. You only went along with all of this because you didnt know if or how you could go back home Even so you shouldve given sincere thought into the kind of position this was when you made your decision.The Empress is the mother of all who live in this Empire Shes the official wife and the most beloved partner of the Emperor who must shoulder the Empire Your position is not something to be taken lightly Its not a title you can just take because you just wanted to go along with it and then whine about itI have...I have always wanted to stand where you are yet I could never do so I worked my whole life to be able to stand by his side and support him yet.. Aristias emotions began to boil over.Tia...It...it angers me to see how carelessly youre taken all of this Your Majesty I pity the Emperor and the people of our Empire...But most of all...I pity myself for spending all my youth preparing and only ending up worthless in his eyes. Only being used to do work that was no longer supposed to be mine... I ended up becoming a lesser wife...a lower queen...because of someone like her...Someone who cant understand how important her role is Just why...why did he choose someone like her as his partner Whats so wonderful about her Tia II just...I suddenly came to a strange place. I was confused. And it was hard for me to accept that Ruvey the only person I relied on in this world had another wife. And that his wife was you my friend. I think thats why I said something I shouldnt have. Im sorry...Ill be leaving now...Whats gotten into me... Aristia sighed and sunk back into her seat. I couldve held back. I wonder why Ive been feeling strangely impatient these days. Like Im unable to push back my frustration anymore...Aristia looked down on her desk thats right these documents still need to be authorized by the...Empress. Jieun is able to enjoy all the privileges and luxuries of an Empress as well as indulge in his love yet she doesnt do any of the duties that traditionally go with her station.Aristia picked up her her pen to begin signing but her door was slammed open and she dropped her pen. Looking up she saw Ruveliss.Aristia quickly got up and curtsies. Welcome Your Majesty. The Sun of the Empire.He stomped over to her and delivered a swift and painful slap to her face. What the hell did you say to Jieun Did you tell her you were supposed to be Empress...I would never Your Majesty... Aristia brought her shaking hand up to the cheek he slapped.So why did Jieun come to me in tears and tell me to be with you Of course on the inside I pitied myself and blamed Jieun. But once Jieun appeared I never thought of you as mine...You had never once been kind to me...I know what I desired was but a pipe dream...And I would never wish for your love now... Frustrated with her silence Ruveliss spoke first Do you wish to become my woman that badly That youd use Jieun I cant understand what for. I know its not for love. A bitter cold and spiteful woman like you who doesnt even cry when slapped...You could never feel love.House Monique is flourishing so it cant be out of loyalty to your family. Oh I get it. You wish to bear the future emperor so you could perhaps take the place that was never yours right No Though I had never been loved by you I wanted to love you even if my feelings were doomed to be onesided forever. I wanted to be someone who could help you I never once thought of this as my duty nor did I ever have such motives Ruveliss roughly grabbed Aristias wrist Strip.She stared at him mouth agape.What are you surprised for Isnt this what you wanted If you want to be my woman that badly then I will make you so He slammed her against the desk.Your Majesty Dont do this Aristia resisted and refused to meet his eyes Your Majesty pleaseWhy are you pretending to hesitate now Isnt this what you wantedNno I never wanted this Im not a concubine I am a Queen I will only undress and give myself to someone of my own accord please let me goA queen Not a concubine Hah He tightened his grip on her wrist and forced her to look at him with his other hand Make no mistake you are nothing to me.He slammed her against the wall.No PleaseSilence Ill do as you wishI never wished for this please..Two months passed since that traumatizing event. However regardless of whether Aristia was feeling up to it or not she wasnt she was still expected to attend the Grand Banquet being held later today. She had gotten up earlier however since the Empress had called her out wanting to meet in the Emperors Garden before the banquet.Once Aristia arrived Jieun didnt hesitate to speak her mind Tia Im sorry but...Ive fallen in love with Ruvey.Aristia said nothing her face devoid of emotion just hearing any variant of his name nickname or otherwise made her recall the terror but Jieun didnt seem to know.At first I rejected his words of love because of you but in the end I couldnt help fall in love with someone as kind as him. Him Kind If only you knew.. The two of us will...become one once the banquet is over. But Ill treasure you like my own little sister for the rest of my life Jieun took Aristias hands and squeezed them. Well be best friends just like real sisters OkayAristia could only squeeze her hands back but it wasnt a sign of agreeing with her as Jieun believed but rather since Aristia was unable to ball her hands into fists this was the most she could do.Well we should get ready Ill see you at the banquet okay Jieun pried her hands way from Aristias and went back into the palace.Urp... Aristia used one of her hands to cover her mouth and the other to steady herself on the silver birch tree. Maybe...Im getting sick.After the feeling of nausea subsided Aristia made her way back to her chambers and prepared for the banquet.The banquet was to celebrate Jieuns one year anniversary since appearing in the Empire. A celebration the Emperor insisted on having. People were happily crowding around their Emperor and Empress as the two happily held each others hands and received the peoples congratulations.I dont understand the logic in congratulating them for this anniversary. Congratulations for falling from the sky from another world Congratulations for happening upon a mysterious girl near the pond on royal grounds Aristia hid behind a marble pillar she didnt feel like joining the festivities. Especially since she felt sick. The nausea from earlier was beginning to come back.Despite hiding away a maid came up to Aristia You Grace are you feeling ill You seem pale...Oh I...Im alright. Its just a bit of...urp Aristia stumbled as she held her hand up to her face. The maid quickly helped steady her.I havent even eaten anything yet but my insides feel like theyre turning over Upon regaining her composure Aristia noticed many guests where looking at her and whispering amongst themselves. Why are they looking at me like that..Is something wrong Ruveliss and Jieun came up to Aristia upon seeing the commotion.Aristia quickly curtsied Its nothing Your Majesties nothing is wr...urrp Urrph Aristia fell to her knees.Your Grace The maid hurriedly knelt next to her and rubbed her back.Congratulations Your Majesty A man came up to them his voice booming.What do you mean by that Sir Rass Ruveliss addressed the man.Although I may seem quite hasty I do believe the Queen is with child That is a great blessing to this Empire and the royal family. Its only right for me to offer congratulations is it not With Sir Rasss loud voice soon the entire crowd of guests had their attention on Aristia.They all soon began speaking quite loudly compared to the whispers from before.Shes pregnantThe Empress is right there yet the lesser wife got pregnant first.Then she could...But despite all the gossip Aristia could only think of one thing Im...with childNOOOOOOO Jieun wailed and slumped to the floor.Jieun Jieun Are you alright Jieun did not respond to Ruvelisss call as she stared at Aristia. Here Jieun stand up.Even after being held up by Ruveliss Jieun was still staring blankly at Aristia.Hear me dear Queen. Aristia looked at Ruveliss. To think Id hear news of your child on such a memorable day as today its quite a blessing. I am truly delighted.His voice is tender...but his eyes are so cold He isnt speaking the truth hes simply saving face.. Aristia was shaking. Of course she didnt expect any true kindness form him whether she was with his child or not but something about the way his tone and his stare didnt match....was very frightening.However the guests erupted in cheers Congratulations Your Majesty Congratulations Your Grace the QueenSince you dont seem to be well would it not be better for you to return to your chambers and rest nowYes Your Majesty...Then I shall take my leave. Aristia curtsied.I should be walking you out but the guest of honor shouldnt leave his place. I shall send a doctor to look over your health and see you afterward. Do take care of yourself.I...am grateful Your Majesty. Aristia couldnt believe her voice wasnt shaking. Before leaving she glanced at Jieun...who was hatefully glaring at her.Aristia left the banquet hall with the maid from earlier scurrying behind to help her.As Aristia walked to her chambers she clasped her shaking hands together He is clearly banishing me...You must let yourself rest since this is only the beginning of your pregnancy. This tea will help you feel better and less nauseous. Ive already had a mad inform kitchen staff to prepare some for you every morning. The doctor smiled as he handed her a cup of tea.Thank you. Aristia weakly smiled. So I really am with child...I thought I was just sluggish and feeling sick from overworking these days.The doctor bowed and left her room.She took a sip of the tea and placed her free hand on her stomach Theres a baby in here... Although she couldnt say she was happy with how it happened she would cherish this child. They may have the Emperors blood but they were also still her child.Your father....wont love us but Ill make sure you to give you an abundance of love youll never feel unloved I promise you. Aristia smiled as she rubbed her belly.Three weeks had passed since the banquet. Although Ruveliss said he would come see her he never did. Of course I knew he wouldnt but....He called me to his office today... Urph.. Unfortunately the day he decided he wanted to see her but not go to her chambers had to be on a day she was feeling particularly dizzy and sluggish. I often feel ill and uneasy these days...I wonder if its because of all the rain lately. Aristia listened to the pitter patter of the rain against the windows in the hallways before entering the Emperors office.I am here as you requested Your Majesty the Sun of the Empire. Aristia curtsied.I dont wish to speak with you for long so Ill be brief. He turned away from the window and faced her. I dont suspect that the child in your belly is not mine. Judging by your high sense of pride you wouldnt sleep around with some other man.Stay calm...stay calm... Aristia chanted to herself. But she couldnt tell why she needed to stay calm. Was it from the fear of being near the man who...Or was it from the anger she felt towards him at that moment Saying that her high sense of pride is the only reason she wouldnt sleep around... Stay calm...stay calm...However keep this in mind. I will choose my heir. And I will only choose amongst the children from the Empress not you. It doesnt matter to me how many children you bear or how intelligent or strong the children grow to be. They will never become my heir. Do you understand It feels as if hes slicing a knife through my entire body...stay calm...stay... Why arent you answering I asked Do. You. UnderstandYes...I under....uh Aristia felt her eyes get blurry and the room began to spin...Ahh Aristia was about to fall to the ground but was caught by Ruveliss.For once he actually showed true concern for Aristia. Are...Ruuuvey I didnt want to wait for you any longer so I came to you Jieun happily threw open the doors to Ruvelisss office wide open. Since today we...Jieuns smile faded and was replaced with a glare How could you...Jieun this isHow could you both do this to meJieun this isnt what you think the QueI dont care Jieun ran out of the office.Wait Jieun Please just listen to me Jieun Ruveliss let go of Aristia and was about to give chase but...KYAAAAAAHWhat.. QueenAh.. My...my belly My baby Aristia clutched her stomach. It feels like my stomach is being ripped to pieces It hurts it hurts so much My baby My baby Is there anyone outside Call the doctor here Now Ruveliss shouted.My...ba...by... The world was growing dark. The pain was too much. But surely...her baby would be alright...right The doctor would be here soon soon soon...So its okay to...drift off...her baby will be...fine...But before she drifted off she felt something warm pool between her legs and she could hear a distant scream BloSun crept through the windows in Aristias chambers. Morning Ah just another day but why do I feel so...emptyAre you awake Your Grace Upon seeing the doctor yesterdays events flooded Aristias mind.She clutched her bed sheets in a white knuckle grip. Did I lose...my babyIm afraid so...I am so very sorry Your Grace.I thought as much...it did feel like there was a lot of blood. But even if she figured this was inevitable it didnt stop the pain in her heart. She had already promised to love and cherish her child...to think she wouldnt be able to hold them in her arms and tell them how much she loved them...Then...Will II will I be able to bear another childThats...because you were always quite frail in health since you were young Your Grace... The doctor stopped there. I see...then I wont be able to have my own child...Now and forever...But maybe thats for the best...after all they say Im a cold heartless woman....Would any child be happy raised by such a mother Although Aristia tried to convince herself that this was for the best she silently wept to herself.Gossip began to spread throughout the palace in the coming weeks.The Queen is in such a state yet her father Marquis Monique hasnt even come to see her. He only goes back and forth from the knights quartersWell of course. House Monique had always been fiercely loyal to the royal family. I mean he didnt even show any discontent when his daughter became a lesser wife instead of the Empress Thats a big humiliation after all the years she trained to be Empress.Maybe he doesnt care about his daughterWell the queen certainly seems calm after losing her child. Ice must flow through the veins of that entire family.I wonder...how much time has past. Days Weeks It feels like an eternity to me... Aristia lost her sense of time she slept through most of the days and nights. Or rather she attempted to. Most times she would wake up after only an hour of sleep from a nightmare and attempt to fall back asleep for another three...Staying in bed isnt going to help me...I should head to the office. Im sure a lot of work has piled up while I was away. Aristia dressed in some simple clothing and was going to head out but she could hear maids gossiping on the other side of the door. Normally she wouldnt care but...this time she cracked open the door a bit.Hey did you hear the newsIs it trueIt is I heard the head maid talking about it herself The Empress is with child Jieun...is pregnant I heard that the Emperor was so very delighted Theyre going to hold a grand banquet and offer gifts to all the people in the Empire Even the temples are praying to bless the child of the prophesied EmpressAmazing The Empire will finally welcome an heir to the throne When I was with child...there were no such celebrations...and nobody rejoiced...nobody...not even the only family I had left... Ha...Haha Ahahahahaha Aristia broke down into a fit of laughter.Ah Your Grace Forgive us The maids said once they realized Aristia had been listening.Pregnant Shes pregnant So Jieun has a child does she Aristia said between bouts of laughter.Pplease calm yourself Your GraceMy Dear Queen is something wrong Suddenly a man burst threw the doors of her chambers. It was a man Aristia recognized a man she had not seen for a long while.Sir Monique The maids yelped.So youve finally decided to step foot into the palace father Are you here to congratulate the Empress for bearing a child as well You must be I wont ever be able to have a child form now on but look Shes pregnant How funny Dont you think so father Aristia continued to laugh and laugh.Her father walked to her and grabbed her by the shoulders Please get a hold of yourselfI....forgive me for being such a disgrace father... Aristia frowned He must be disappointed. After all Ive been trained since I was little to contain all my emotions and yet...Hes always been stern to everyone me himself...I should have never sent you here....WhatHer father had never once disobeyed anything that was decided by the royal family. He was always loyal. So just what did he mean by saying that nowYour Grace please listen closely. I have to travel to the borders due to an urgent matter. So please stay strong and wait for me. When I return I will bring you back to our Monique family home.Is that really true father Can I...Can I really go back homeI will definitely take you home we will go together. So please ready yourself and stay well.Yes.. Yes fatherFather.. He was always so stern and strict with me but now hes showing genuine concern Although as she watched her fathers back as began to walk away uneasiness began to bubble up within her.Father...he seems so far away now. Maybe I should call him back tell him not to leave. She shook her head. No hell return soon. He always keeps his promises. When he comes back Ill ask him...did you really think me more important than the royal family Even though you always put them and the Empire before everything and everyone Four days after Sir Monique went on his mission to the borders Empress Jieun was attacked on her way to town.A maid who had followed her secretly saw her laying on the ground but saw no one YYour MajestyJieun was quickly brought back to her chambers and a doctor was called. Soon after Ruveliss came bursting through the door.JieunRRuvey...Our baby...I lost our baby She buried her head into his shoulder.Jieun...who did this to you To our child Ruveliss roared as he held her tight.II didnt see theyre faces they wore masks. But Im sure...Im sure it was that dastardly Sir Monique behind it all He must hold a grudge because of TiaWhy those...You maid Call the guards I want the head of the Monique family apprehended immediately Hell be executed on the morrowBbut Your Majesty... The maid who had not seen anyone tried to speak up but was silenced by the glare from Ruveliss. Frightened she ran off and called the guards. Once the guards ran off she went to her room and wrote a letter to her roommate instructing her to inform the Queen of what is about to transpire...and another bidding farewell to her family....The maid knew this would be the last thing she would do...The next day the maids roommate found the letter addressed to her a little after morning. Panicked she burned the letter before making her way to Aristias office.Your Grace Your Grace Its an emergency The maid wailed. Marquis Monique was arrested for treasonMy father She dropped the documents in her hands shaking. This cant be...The maid explained the contents of the letter her roommate had given her. About how her father was said to be the mastermind after Jieun attested against him with no concrete evidence if she may add. And how the Emperor planned to execute him today.Aristia ran out of her office and headed towards the throne room Father is a loyal man he would never do such a thingAs expected the Emperor was sitting on his throne. Your Majesty please spare my father I beg you...Youre asking me to forgive someone who tried to kill the Empress He glared.There must be some sort of misunderstand Father would never do such a thing Please...think of the countless years our house has been loyal to the royal family. Please spare his life..A wicked smirk appeared on his face Kneel.PPardonDidnt you say you wanted to save your fatherYes...Then kneel at my feet and lay your head on the ground. Lick my shoe and I shall spare your father.... Aristia clenched her dress.Well Cant you do it I...I am a woman who has been trained all her life to be an Empress to be the beloved partner of the Emperor. Watch and judge the people alongside him...stand by his side as an equal...I was taught to uphold my pride above all else... Even after all thats happened even as a lesser wife I am still a member of the royal family...Im sure father would want me to continue upholding my pride and not do something so humiliating but... My father showed me his love and concern for the first time. He promised wed go home together. Pride dignity...none of that matters to me anymore I will save my father no matter what Aristia went up to the Emperor and knelt before him bringing her face to his foot she did as she had been instructed all for the sake of her father.Hmph you had always been arrogant. Now I finally see you kneel....Will you spare my fathers life as promised Aristia looked at him hopefully.He grinned Oh how unfortunate. Your father is already dead. He was executed this morning.I wont...ever see my father again Tears pricked her eyes.Youre more naive than I thought. Did you really think I would let him live He killed my child he hurt my Jieun. The Emperor grinned at her. All you did was for naught. A man who kills a royal heir deserves to hang.Aristia never longed for her fathers love and affection she knew that in his eyes her duty came first. But during the last moments when she saw his back as he left...the final time she would ever see him she thought that perhaps they could happily live as a real family for once. It was a flickering hope. A final string of happiness she had thought she could grasp but in what seemed like a blink of the eye that string had been used to end her fathers life upon the gallows.Now she would never know that happiness between a parent and child. Her father had been taken from her...and her child had as well...her child...her child..You say my father killed your child And that such a man deserves to hang for killing a royal heir Then what about you.. Aristia stood up glaring at him as tears streamed down her face. You took away my father and my child...you took everything from me and left me with nothing So what about you Wheres your punishmentHe gave her no answer as he grinned at her clearly gloating. How dare he...how dare he...how dare he..How dare you She took the golden hair stick from her hair and with all the force she could muster she thrust it into the Emperors chest Taking it out again the blood splattered onto her chest and more fell to the floor from his new wound.Ugh.. He groaned in pain.Your Majesty Your Majesty is wounded Servants and guards came rushing in.Hurry call for the doctor One servant shouted The rest of you apprehend the queenAristia did not struggle as the guards surrounded her and dragged her away to a prison cell. She was surprised at her own actions if she was honest. How could she do something like that Shed never hurt a fly But the Emperor...the Emperor..She was thrown into a cell and as soon as the doors closed she weakly got up and looked out the small window of the cell. This wasnt meant to happen...what went wrong What happened to me The following day Aristia was taken from her cell early morning her hair was cut short and she was changed into rags. Today she would be publicly executed by guillotine.As she was escorted towards the guillotine she began to think. Where did it all go wrong Why am I here Finally she stood in front of the guillotine as a guard read her wrongdoings.The sinner Aristia La Monique engaged in immoral activities out of petty envy and jealousy And has committed a great treason by daring to assassinate the Emperor Petty envy Jealousy No...he abandoned me and robbed me of everything...I wouldnt be here if he had just allowed me to leave with my father... As such she will be deposed of the position of Queen. The fortune title and land of the Monique marquisate will be confiscated. As punishment for attempting to murder a royal...as punishment for her sins... Sins My only sin... ..She will be executed ...was loving you... The guard roughly pushed Aristia forward and secured her upon the stocks on the guillotines bottom frame. The citizens around murmured to themselves and glared at her a few others however seemed to hold at least a bit of pity for her but dared not voice it.Looking forward Aristia saw that the Emperor and Empress had a wonderful view of her. It seemed like Jieun was terrified over the guillotine and buried her face into the Emperors side as he hugged her reassuringly. Then his eyes met Aristias.He smirked at her.Something within Aristia snapped and tears began to stream down her face. She gave a deprecating laugh. You had been my only purpose in life yet to you I was only a bother.On my mark he guard raised his hand up. If I could begin my life anew...I promise... The guard swung his hand down. I wont ever...love you again...

https://archiveofourown.org/works/31023125,she sharpens her teeth on the bones of men,Aristia la Monique wakes up not in the past when all of the wrongs and the horrible things havent happened. She wakes in the middle of a nightmare surrounded by enemies and still tender from the lost of her unborn child.Except this time the wool has been lifted from her eyes.Because this time when she looked at Ruveliss Kamaluddin Shana Castina she doesnt see a lost possibility of a loving future or a man she dearly wishes loves her back.When she sees him again she sees him for who he is a weak man playing at being Emperor. Too blinded by his own jealousy to recognize and reward the worth of people around him.He had told her to kneel. As someone who had been taught to stand beside him rule as his equal his command stung. But it hadnt been shocking. In a way she had come to expect it and when the order came its the final nail to the coffin.Aristia la Monique was raised to be the Empress not the Emperors lover. The Empress holds power of her own right. A degree of that power might be bestowed by the Emperors favor of her. Ruveliss might shame her by lowering her down to a mere Queen and granting that power to Jieun. But its a power Jieun practically cedes to her by how all the Empress duties are all but shoved to Aristias table.Its duties she used to seethe at but now she sees it as what it is. The Empress duties are power and Aristia has always been perfect at what she sets out to do. Now will be no different.,Mature,Women Being AwesomeAlternate Universe - Canon DivergencePoliticsMiscarriage
https://archiveofourown.org/works/41229213,"Once More, Begrudgingly",You should explain yourself you knowAristia La Monique was sitting crosslegged on the floor of the main prayer room of The Great Temple Sanctus Vita.You see after admitting about her first life to all of her best friends Allendis Carsein and especially Ruveliss she came to an epiphany. A revelation. A wakeup call.God Vita used to tell her that she was being brought back after her death because she needs to disentangle the twisted fate of many people caused by the loss of the original blessed child a.k.a Jieuns soul to another universe. Aristia believed back then that she could achieve it by avoiding royal marriage rising as Marquess Monique and basically befriending Ruveliss so he was less inclined to separate her head from her body.But it was not all of it was it she rest her chin on top of her hand like a detective coming onto the villain. What happened after my deathAm I the villain in this story Ms. Detective Vitas voice rang in her head leaving a dull ache.Aristia pushed through anyway. Yes you are. If you didnt lose Jieuns soul in the first place all of these problems will never happen.Why are you so cruel to meDo you not have a mirror somewhere in heaven Aristia told her God massaging her temple. Distantly she remembered the last time she had a conversation like this with Vita she passed out for days. Does divine power not compatible with the human bodyI have no physical body and yes it is not compatible. There is a reason why I only gave prophecies to a select few people and never had conversations like this before. Not everyone can handle it and even if they could it put a great strain on their bodies.So am I the first person having these kinds of conversations with you Wow for you to break your own rule what happened must be terrible. Now stop stalling.If Vita has an actual physical body He would sigh so deep His breath blow up a mountain or something. But this is something he cant avoid can heIf you dont answer I swear I will jump out of the nearest clock tower. See how your plan can go well if you put Allendis in my place as Crown Princess instead.That made Vita pause. Why AllendisCarsein is Ruvelisss cousin. This is the last time I ask before Im going to the clock tower. What. Happened. After. I. DieVery well I will show you. But dont blame me if you passed out again.The altar started to shine. And just like the last time Aristia was shown the story of What Happened AfterTM . With Diagram. Just like time she was still unsure what the Diagram was for but it was still provided.You can just say it from the very start you know No need for all theomission. Aristia grumbled on her bed three days later after being found passed out in front of the altar by the priests. As usual her father fussed so much she was told to stay in bed for the rest of the week no guests were allowed.Which is a good thing for Aristia because she needs to collect her mind after seeing the future of the timeline she left behind. By God that future was more terrible than she thought it would be. The Empire actually fall. To be honest she doesnt give a damn about the fate of that Empire. She and her father died because of the Empire after all. But this timeline is a whole different matter. Shes alive her familys thriving and she has good friends. Theres no way she let this one fall.There are restrictions on how much we Gods can guide humans. I can tell you this now because your actions so far have led to better future options for the empire. Back then when you just woke up in this timeline I have no such liberties.The ache in her head came back in full force. Calm down on the explanation will you I was just recovering from your last revelation. One or two sentences as usual are still fine but a fullblown paragraph is too much for her fragile mortal body. Also why did I have to go to the temple if we can converse anywhere Is it because your divine energy is stronger there Actually we can converse anywhere but in my temple your body can handle it better.Yeah my head is killing me.Do you want me to call the doctor back my Lady the everloyal Lina asked her as she enters the room with a tray of food. It was laden with a bowl of soup milk and some fruits.No need but please bring me the food. I will get better after eating something.Obediently Line put the tray on the bed. Would you like me to bring something else she asked as Aristia started to scoop the soup and start eating it.Mmnot really. Justlet me eat on my own.Ah yes then excuse me my Lady.After Lina closed the door Aristia put down her spoon.Now that you can tell me more it means I am on the right path already. But theres still more is it not she asked Vita.Correct.Figures. But when has my life ever been easy Youre lucky I actually like the Ruveliss in this timeline. I still dont want to be his wife though.Then you should try harder.You are the last person God I want to hear that from.Good luck child.And with that Aristia was effectively begrudgingly recruited into a highrisk troublesome job with no pay but she had to do it anyway because she has a lot of people she loved and who loved her back that she needs to protect from unfortunate future.Whew that was a mouthful Aristia thought as she bite into an apple.Aristia was pleasantly surprised that because of her being bedridden on her fathers order she received many cards from people asking to visit her. Her three best friends aside she actually received cards from Lady Genoa Lady Niante and even from Princess RuaWait why is Princess Rua still hereHer question is answered by Carsein who was holding a book titled History of Castina Empire Knight Order which is a very Carsein choice. She hit it off with my brother and there are marriage talks already between our family and the Rua Kingdoms royal family.The day after she woke up Aristia invited her friends to come and hang out in her family library. Also now that everyone knows her secret they can discuss it freely and they can even help her find a way to save the Empire. If anyone asked it was a winwin for her.Its really nice to have a smooth sailing romance huh I kind of envy her. Aristia mused.Ruveliss looked at her from the sofa he sat on. I thought you have no interest in romance Why are you envying herAristia sighed palming her face with one hand her expression a picture of wistfulness Well seeing my last attempt in romance ended with decapitation of course how can I maintain interest in it That doesnt mean I cannot appreciate such a smooth sailing romance as Princess de Rua had.Ruveliss covered his face You dont hold back anymore do you he said before being all depressed in the corner of the library where they are hanging out I deserve it though.Nah dont be like that. That other Ruveliss is a different person from you and I dont hold you accountable for what hes done. Aristia told him already fully accepted the reality of being unwillingly employed by God Vita to save the empire and to an extent Ruveliss.No wait whatis this situation a new voice can be heard. A greenhaired boy stood in shock at the door of the library. A pile of gifts falls from his hand to the floor.Allendis de Verita left Castina Empire for six months touring foreign kingdoms to establish better trade and stimulate economic development. He worked closely with his father both as a student and advisor and received his fathers approval a rise in governmental rank and a rise in salary not that he needed it being a son of rich aristocrats himself but it was nice to have more fund to buy gifts for AristiaHe was on cloud nine up until he heard Aristia passed out since last week and when he reached her house due to his worry he found both Carsein and the Crown Prince already occupied a spot in the Monique library. His day turned to worst when he found out that all of them already knows Aristias secret. Even the main culprit himselfThis. Is. Not. Fair. He positively whines. Do you know how long it took me to get Aristia to tell me Why was it so easy for all of youIt took a while for the three to coax their greenhaired friend to sit on one of the sofas supplying him with tea and cookies until he calmed down enough for a decent conversation.Aristia giggled Im sorry Allendis. If its any consolation your reaction when I told you my story was what made me able to tell the others. You made me believe that I would not be considered crazy.In her defense though I accidentally overheard her telling Carsein about it. Ruveliss told him and then whispered I also overheard Carsein saying some cheesy lines so you better be prepared.Ah the Crown Prince. His biggest supporter hes actually not and his greatest adversary also no.Despite Carsein making his move this situation is overall better for Aristia. Now they can investigate everything openly and Allendis gained powerful minions ally in his two friends. Yes he has friends now and if anyone asks him three friends Aristia included ever since his failure at winning the girls heart are too many for his sanity.So. Alendis started clapping his hand once to get the attention of the total of three other people in the room. How far did Aristia tell all of youOh Oh Me I can answer this Carsein said excitedly raising his hand. Everything about her first lifeAristia smiled at him patting his head approvingly. Allendis squinted his eyes at the display but he corrected Carsein anyway. In her point of view. He said.Hmm Ruveliss crossed his arms in front of his chest thinking. There are always two sides to every story.After listening to Aristias story the first thing crossing my mind was it doesnt sound like you Allendis said truthfully.Now that I know you well enough I agree with Allendiss assessment. It doesnt sound like you at all. The rage the resentment the cold treatmentits all very different from the Ruveliss we know of. Aristia told him.Have you considered that our Ruveliss is simply happier because he has friends now Carsein quipped.That hurts cousin. Ruvelliss protested. Carsein chuckled at the blush painting his cousins face You didnt deny it. The redhaired boy said.That also crossed my mind. What if Ruveliss is simply happier now because of us then it means we succeeded in avoiding the original fate no But nooo God Vita himself told me theres more to it.Ruveliss thought that Aristias connection with their resident guardian God is dangerous as in had she been with anyone other than them she would be tried for blasphemy.But she had been so blas√© to him the Crown Prince so Ruveliss guessed that her being blasphemous is not so far beyond the realm of possibility.You guys are not THAT precious to me you know he said rolling his eyes.Aristia smiled lost in nostalgia He used to be a sad gloomy loner. She said.That explains why he became such a sad excuse of an Emperor.That last sentence was from Ruveliss himself making his friends look at him in surprise. What Aside from Aristia obviously I was the one most offended by him you know My reputation and future happiness are at stake here.Your reputation is nonexistent for us but I agree with the other Allendis told him.Sooyou consider us precious Little Sun. Aristias smile is full of teeth.Why yes Little Moon. I wouldnt be here otherwise.Alright Aristia thought that was sweet but still annoying.Just you see. Jieun will come in two years and I will no longer be the damned Little Moon. Ah yes Aristia is now officially the crown princess of Castina Empire. As she previously expressed several times the Crown Princess Selection event is a waste of time. Which part of The Crown Princess is already chosen did Duke Jena didnt getAnd to think Aristia was actually somewhat related to him through her mother. Ugh she shuddered.You dont have to continue to be my fianc√©e you know I can choose one of the princesses to take over from you. Ruveliss told her. I am even willing to ask my father for this.Listen I know for a fact that the other Blessed Child will come. This is why I keep her seat warm no other woman deserves the same fate as I did not even someone as annoying as Princess Moira de Yit.I am not that person anymore the one that killed you. He said sadly. Carsein moved closer to him to pat his shoulder.Aristia reached out to hold Ruveliss hand. I know. Believe me I know. She said softly. But the matter of Crown Princess is not just like and dislike it is a matter of power consolidation. At this point no other eligible noble lady can surpass my political power. As a blessed child I can even contend the throne so unless you want the current power balance to change you cant change my position.Ruveliss looked at her in silence then cupped the girls face with his palm. You really are not a fourteen years old girl are you he said softly.I thought you believed my story.Believing something and witnessing the proof are two different things.So both of you are getting closer when I was away huh All touchytouchy now huh Allendis is squatting in the corner of the room playing with wayward ants.Jealousy is unseemly Verita. Ruveliss commented releasing his hold on Aristia.Eh Jealous Carsein asked innocently. Allendislike Aristia he asked confused.He does Aristia said bluntly nodding her head.Can you pretend you didnt notice or something Allendis complained.The girl shrugged But why would I You are so obvious. And you already confessed.Aristia knows Allendis like her And already confessed Carsein asked again a tad bit hysterical.Calm down cousin.Do you like Aristia too the redhaired boy suddenly looked at Ruveliss.Uhh Id rather not. Not that she wasnt a charming and beautiful girl butI mean you know what happened last time. My feeling is morebrotherlyAristia sighed happily You are getting better and better Little Sun. I am optimistic about the success of our endeavor.Yes dear. Ruveliss retorted flatly. Oh my he continued after seeing the state of shellshocked Carsein. It seems like we gave him a reason to think. He moved closer to Allendis to whisper Good luck comrade.Nothing is going right for me today Allendis mumbled shaking his head sadly.Allendiss misfortune aside you know based on your story I dont think I will like her that much. Will I ever fall in love with her this time knowing what she has done to you You are a precious friend to me. Ruveliss pointed out. He imagined if Jieun doesnt get along with Aristia this time he might just ditch her because he wouldnt risk Aristias wrath.True love be damned last time Ruveliss fell in love with this Jieun the empire falls so he was actually a little bit scared to do so again. Then again the Jieun that will come is possibly another version of Jieun who hasnt hurt Aristia yet sowellhe never said that his life is not complicated.You will like her she has this amazing voluptuous body. At Ruvelisss blush she giggled then continued Although we do need to have a plan to bring Jieun to our side no matter what. Last time she became Duke Jenas adopted daughter and I was not a Blessed Child so the power balance shifted to Noble faction. Plus Ruveliss did not favor me so he distances himself from Aristocrat Faction tipping the scale further. The situation turned to the worst for us because the Emperor passed away due to his illness.And thats another thing they have to think about the Emperor only has two more years to live. Currently he already started to weaken and shifted his work to Ruveliss instead.I will see if I can take over more work burden from my father. I expect you to talk to yours to support me more Verita. I will need more people in my staff you included. Ruveliss told them.I will talk to my mother to persuade His Majesty to take a holiday for recuperation. Carsein supplied.And while you are at it please tell His Majesty to stop sending me to the border in the next two years. I need to be here for my daughter when the other Blessed Child comes. Suddenly Keireans voice can be heard. The Marquess leaned on the door smiling coldly. Your scheming is not as private as you thought kids.All three boys in the room were frozen in shock.You told your father Allendis whispered.Aristia raised one eyebrow at his question as if it was the silliest question in the world. Why of course he was the first one to know.As much as I want to say that my daughter doesnt need you boys she seems to be happy when she was among you. That is the only reason I havent released the hound yet. Keirean la Monique walks slowly inside the room and casually occupies the middle sofa in between Aristia and the rest of the boys.Aristia smiled sweetly before hugging her fathers arm. You are the best daddy.Now where were we Please continue. Marquess Monique told them.His daughter helpfully summarized their earlier conversation for him.So you were saying something would happen to His Highness that changed his personalityWe are almost positive about it. The disparity between their behavior is too far. Last I remembered he was erratic prone to outbursts. He executed you without trial Daddy despite not enough proof of you sending assassins that made the Empress miscarriage.The fact that he executed both of us is the most unbelievable thing for me for reasons I cannot divulge yet. You are right something is amiss. Keirean said deep in his thoughts.Allendis took this opportunity to tell him This might be the best time to tell you that I have been infiltrating the Noble faction lately. They are planning something but I have no idea what.Keirean looked at him a little bit impressed How did you manage to do thatJust a word here and there about how dissatisfied I am that my brother is the heir instead of me. I no longer want to be the heir but faking it is not difficult. They approached me like bees to honey. The greenhaired boy said with a flourish.Ruveliss hold back a smile. Allendis is no longer wanting to be his familys heir because he wants to be Aristias consort. And from the look of Marquess Monique he grasps this already.Thank you for this information I will see what I can get from my resources Keirean told them before rising from the sofa. He has some work this afternoon so he cannot stay long in the discussion. And remember sweetheart if you need something you tell your father ok he said to Aristia before kissing her forehead.I think I speak for everyone when I say that was terrifying Carsein said after Keirean closed the door behind him.The rest of the boys nodded solemnly.Oh come on guys my daddy is the sweetest in the world Hey Whats with that look GuysNothing gets your blood going like a knight combat practice after a long absence.Aristia wiped the sweat off her brow inserting her sword into its sheath. She bowed at her opponent and moved under the shades to rest. She has finished the practice today and stayed to watch the official knights turn to practice. Her eyes locked on the neat rows of people on the practice field. They swung their sword back and forth in a uniform slashing movement and once in a while Aristia followed the same movement from where she stood.Your form is getting better Carsein said walking closer to the girl.Hey Carsein. You didnt join the practice she asked.My father sent me on an errand. Why are you still here I thought the squires practice is done already.Just watching the knights. Perhaps I can learn something you know Aristia answered him.Carsein nodded. That is a good attitude he agrees. But not for long because Aristia stopped responding to him. Instead she was watching the knights with unblinking eyes.Why are you watching them sointensely he asked her waving his hand in front of her face.These knights sure aremuscly. And sweaty she said with a smile making Carsein suddenly has the urge to cover her eyes with his hand but doing so would be impolite.As I thought she said holding her chin in a deep thinking pose Muscles are the greawhat are you doing Carsein She clawed at the hand that was suddenly covering her eyes courtesy of her redhaired friend.You were being a pervert Carsein furiously whispered at her politeness be damned.What What did I do I was just admiring their musclesIt was perverseWhich part The one where I imagine how huge their commphhh Carseins hand now moved to Aristias lips. His face went closer to hers and between gritted teeth he said What were you going to say my LadyAristia licked his palm. Carsein takes his hand off Aristias face in surprise Aristia How could a lady lilililiLickYes thatIve licked worse things but you are not ready for that conversation. She said flatly.Carseins face is now as red as his hair gaping at Aristia while still clutching the hand she licked.For your information I was going to say contribution to the Empire. She said again.I can see the two of you roughhousing from across the practice field. Ruveliss who just came asked them. What happenedTia was leering at the knights muscle Carsein answered him still red in the face. Ruveliss looked at Aristia with full accusation. The younger girl only shrugged. Apparently unconcerned. It was nice muscles. Specifically the arm. Specifically Sir Seymours. She said.The crown prince was silent at her answer then I really cant understand your taste. He said patting Carseins shoulder.Wait why are you saying that to me Your HighnessRuveliss shakes his head in pity.You really need to stop teasing him so much. He said to Aristia offering his arm. Aristia linked her hand in his then let herself be led away. I cant help it hes too fun to tease. And besides she paused until they are out of Carseins hearing range The Knight Carsein in my first life has an amazing arm muscle you know. It was really cool. I aspire to have arms like that. She continued.Ruveliss shakes his head again I still cant understand his taste.So why are you picking me up like thisYou were too friendly with Carsein and some people started to look at you weirdly so I had to show that we are fine.We ARE fine though.Ruveliss grins Always. He sniffed a little bit But you smell like sweat. I have sent a new gown for you to your office. Make sure you bathe before wearing it.Aristia stuck her tongue out at him Rude. She protested I still smell divine.Yeah to Allendis and Carsein perhaps.To everyone.Not me though.Why did you send me a new gownWe are to meet my father this late afternoon. Something about his plan to take a rest in our country villa to recuperate.Aristia gasped You mean Duchess Rass managed to persuade himIt was Marquess Monique. He convinced my father to rest and prepared a team of doctors to monitor his health.My father works fast.It was a good decision to let him in on our plan.Last time I tried to handle everything myself and it blew up on my face. You also had no one by your side except Jieun but she was never trained to handle the work of the Empress. I think it is best if we involve an actual adult this time.Ruveliss nodded in agreement. They walked in comfortable silence until they reach the front of the First Knight Squadrons building. Then see you later my Lady. He said.See you later Your Highness.Aristia took a shower in First Knight Squadrons facility and spent record time preparing herself. His Majesty knows she is working today he had to understand that she will not be able to doll herself up as usual. It is a good thing indeed that Aristia is objectively beautiful with or without makeup so she will not look shabby at all.Ruveliss waited for her in the foyer area of the main palace. An afternoon tea setup has been prepared inside the Emperors private garden and thats where they are going. Surprisingly the two of them are not the only guest this time. They can see Duke and Duchess Rass Duke Verita and Marquess Monique are already seated around the table. The moment the Crown Prince and Princess pair showed up all stood up to greet them.Please sit down. Let us wait for His Majesty to come. Ruveliss said pulling one of the chairs for Aristia.It is nice to see the two of you being close and friendly like this. Duchess Rass commented. You will have a good marriage she continued.Ruveliss smiled at his aunt Aristia will be Marquess Monique and nothing will change that. He said holding Aristias hand. She replied by squeezing him back.Many royal couples are less close than both of you. The Duchess said again.We can afford to be close because we are not a couple Aristia said simply.Interesting. The Duchess said looking at both of them intently I guess all of us will see whether this conviction will hold up in the future.Please wait for it Duchess Aristia said with a sweet smile.Their conversation was interrupted by the announcement of the Emperors arrival. All guests are quickly standing up to greet him. Ruveliss took the initiative to help his father sit down to the latters protest.I am still strong my son. He chided.Helping my father is not a matter of the strength of your body but the strength of my filial piety.Hah look at this kid His words became so sweet ever since he became close with the Crown PrincessYour Majesty praised me too much. Aristia pretend to smiled so sweetly and shyly that it almost give Ruveliss the hives.It is always good to see both of you so close. The Emperor told them. However as per the counsel of my retainers he nods at Marquess Monique and Duchess Rass I decided to recuperate in the Eastern Palace where the weather is warmer.I agree father You need all the rest you can get.Yes and this will be a good experience for you. After all it might not be long before you become the emperor yourself.Your Majesty his retainers cried out. The Emperor raised his hand I dont plan to die tomorrow but now is a good time as any for Ruveliss to learn more.I understand your feeling father but please stay with me for many years ahead. Please heed this selfish wish of mine. Ruveliss hold the Emperors hand who looked at him in surprise and then looked at Aristia.What have you done to him child I am impressed. He told the girl who grins wickedly before answering Having more friends made him happier Your Majesty. My strategy works perfectly.Ruveliss hide his reddened face in his hand making the Emperor laugh louder. After his laugh died out he looked at his retainers Please assist the Crown Prince in any way you can he told them who nods seriously. The rest of the afternoon was filled with small talks but Aristia and Ruveliss cant help but feel relieved. This is the start of their plan and hopefully everything else will always go smoothly.Of course something called smoothly is never a theme in the life and death of one Aristia la Monique. Yes the Emperor agreed to take a rest and from what she heard he was getting healthier each day. Ruveliss is super busy and to an extent Allendis is also super busy because Ruveliss hired him in his team. Aristia is now a beautiful fifteen years old girl and slowly but surely climbed the rank within First Knight Order. She surprisingly has the talents in swordfighting so it is even expected for her to be knighted next year which will be the perfect moment for her to take the knight oath and special Monique family loyalty oath when Jieun came to take over her Crown Princess position. Marquess Monique officially announced Aristia as his heir and he even started to bring her to official noble and aristocrat meetings.Allendis even discovered the existence of a slowacting poison that might or might not be the reason for Ruvelisss change of personality in his previous life apparently ingesting the poison will cause paranoia erratic behavior uncontrolled anger outburst basically the other Ruveliss in a nutshell and with Carseins help still trying to track the origin of said poison and the possibility of it being used by someone within the empire.Everything is perfect. Their plan is on track. Life is good. The future of Castina Empire is bright.But not as bright as the light that suddenly appeared on top of the lake in the palace. It happened during one of the many nobles official meeting which was attended by Marquess Monique and his heir Aristia she still feel giddy every time she is addressed as young lord Monique so there were many people in the palace witnessing the miracle. Everyone came outside in excitement and anticipation because such an occurrence is very rare. There is no chance of secrecy in this one unlike Aristias miracle of being appointed as Blessed Child which was kept secret under the Emperors order.The light was encompassing a mysterious blackhaired girl who floated gracefully over the lake until her feet touched the grass. When she opened her dark eyes all high priests in the empire received a new divine revelation. Lo and behold A new Blessed Child of God Vita.Yes.Jieun Graspe the other Blessed Child has arrived.One year early.Aristia accidentally broke one of the tables inside the nobles meeting room both due to the headache of receiving a revelation and anger because this comes with no warning at all. Fuck her life. Oh but Hey Little Sun do you remember what I told you about JieunThat she has a voluptuous bodyI lied. You should start burning those erotic magazines under your working desk before she saw your original preference.Those are CarseinsI respect you Your Highness but that was slander. Carsein who was on duty to guard Ruveliss today denied him fiercely. but Aristia has a feeling that everything will be just fine.,Mature,Alternate Universe - Canon DivergenceTragedy/ComedyFluff and CrackCrack Treated Seriously

A faint smile curved upon her face as a single tear ran down her cheek. Time seemed to have stopped for them. She knew her hour has come. The moment that delicate thread of fate connecting them eternally was forced to snap by the people she loved. A distant chipping sound was heard. She did not mind. His chest began to slowly rise and fall. The sound grew louder. Cracks appeared on her delicate body. She refused to feel the pain thinking that she lost all her feeling long time ago. He slowly opened his eyes. White feathers surrounded them. Her body began to crumble. Before he knew what happened to him his eyes fell on her ... what remained of her. One last glimpse of her sad smile. A blinding light swept everything. Then all was dark.,Teen And Up Audiences,Not Found
https://archiveofourown.org/works/41075265,Choose me instead,What the heck Aristia what is wrong with you Youre choosing the guy that killed you instead of the one that supported you I mean I get that he changed in the second life but...what about my dear Carsein... The hc hair girl softly shouted in the middle of the night not wanting to get scolded by her parents. Especially her mother. Sighing as she lies down on her bed once again and shuts her eyes. If you gave me a chance...Id take it she murmured before giving in to her tiredness. If thats what you desire my dear...I suppose its time for the contract to start. Good luck YN La Monique. I believe in you and whatever happens do not believe whatever that Vita God says.As YN opened her eyes she is met with an unfamiliar ceiling. In shock she quickly tried to get out of bed while tripping on her blanket. A loud thud and an ow following along were heard from the room. God dang it what is wrong with me she muttered. She looked around in the unfamiliar room but feeling a little nostalgia. Where the fuck am I Whats with this room she thought. As she looked around she noticed a mirror and walked up to it. She could only stare at the mirror in awe although her EC iris and HC locks were the same her appearance was obviously different. As she was about to continue questioning herself a knock was heard. Lady YN Are you awake The Marquess has requested for you. an unknown voice was heard. However it felt as if she wanted to hear that voice again her entire life. Lady YN Is she talking about me Im not a lady the fuck is she talking about Im just a regular human that is really broke who loves anime and simps for 2D characters. YN thought to herself. Lady YN Ill be coming in now. the voice spoke once again. As soon as the voice spoke the door opened and a brownhaired lady who was wearing a maid outfit walked in. Lady YN if you were awake why didnt you answer the unknown woman asked. Who are you was the first thing YN said. She didnt think it was a big deal until she saw the womens face turn from confused into a shocked expression. Lalady YN Are you sure you dont remember anything What about your father Your sister What about your status the woman rapidly fired the questions at her. Seeing as YNs face was still confused the women immediately shout for a doctor. And before she knew it the HC hair girl was back in bed. YNs P.O.V What in the world is happening All I remember was reading The Abandoned Empress before bed and when I woke up Im here. Ohh I get it...I died. Hah as much as this is great and all where did I get reincarnated too All of a sudden the door smashed open and a crying child ran into the room. The child has wavy buttlength silverwhite hair with bangs covering her forehead. She wore a beautiful white dress but her golden yellowish orbs were covered in tears. It was quite obvious she was trying hard not to cry in front of me. I had to blink to make sure I was seeing correctly because this girl is...Aristia la Monique the only Lady of the Monique house. But if that woman from earlier called me lady does that mean Im related to Aristia in some way Sister do you really not remember me Aristia suddenly asked me. Sissister Oh my gosh Im Aristias sister There wasnt a character like that Ok so the story has started to change...wait a minute IM ARISTIAS SISTER I can help Carsein Alright Which life are you at Aristia Err...you are Aristia right I start saying. Thats right Im Aristia La Monique your sister and the older twin out of the two of us. Aristia replied with a happier expression. Is that all you remember she questions once more. Oh god dang it If I knew I would end up here I would have tried to remember the other character names other than Aristia Carsein and the hot daddy material father. Ahhh the fatherOur father is...Marquess Keirean correct I replied slowly to avoid suspicions. Thats right Is that really all you remember I could hear Aristias disappointment but...thats really all the character I actually remember...I call that greenhaired boy grass And the prince blueberry I cant actually tell her that. Thats...right. Thats all I remember..sorry I said with an apologetic look. Dont worry about it you did fell of a tree after all. Ill try my best to help you remember Aristia quickly tell me.What Me fell of a tree I YN LN a person who dont like the outside world climbed a tree Unbelievable. My thoughts were cut off when Aristia started speaking. First off the maid who came in to call you was Mikasa she has been your personal maid since we were both kids. You are currently the only heir to the family since I am currently...engaged to the crown prince of the country Prince Ruvellis Kamaludin Shama Castina. she said the last bit of her sentence with a solemn look. And thats all I need to know that shes on her second life. I jump out from the bed and did a few stretches while she looks at me in shock. YN...I think you should lie back down on the bed... she told me. I just look at her and smile. I dont wanna I said firmly. Shes obviously flustered probably not knowing how to deal with me. I cant blame her though...I am from a different century than her. So Aristia what are we gonna do today I decided to ask wanting to at least know which part of the story Im in. Im going to the temple today do you wanna come with me Ahh...so we are at the beginning of the story. She probably wants to find proof that shes not the prophecy child so that she can call the engagement off...not that it worked though. I shook my head and look at Aristia I would love to join you if you dont mind. I wanted to ask some questions as well am I really here because I made a wish to help Carsein...or if theres something bigger here. Either way Aristia was happy so even if I dont get my answer Im already blessed with such a gorgeous sight. After Aristia left the room the maids start to help me get dress. This is definitely sexual harassment but...I wouldnt be able to wear the dress on my own its too complicated.As I walk out I saw the Marquess or should I say father and Aristia waiting for me. Seeing this I quickly walk towards them hoping they werent waiting long. I apologize for being late will you be coming with us as well father I decided to ask since my memory of this part was a bit foggy. I mean you cant expect me to remember everything right Im no genius I dont even know how the manhwa girls did it. Even though Aristia had trouble sleeping last night he said while looking towards Aristia. Im afraid Im quite busy to join you two. But please be careful I dont wish for anything to happen to you both. father replied. As I hop in the carriage Aristia gave a small smile to father. Well be careful do not worry father she said. I can feel my heart swelling Im seeing it in real life the actual fatherdaughter relationship that only happens in manhwas. Seeing this made me wonder if sleeping beauty Claude has finally woke up Athys suffering so bad...ahh I wanted to at least finish that manhwa before dying. The carriage starts to move but Aristia was still looking back at the mansion with a hazy look. Im guessing if shes wondering whether her past life was a dream or not...cant blame her though even I dont fully accept this after reading so many manhwa related books...I guess this is how the female leads felt. Being forced to know that you die and ending up in a place you know you might get kill...heh what a cruel reality. I look outside the carriage window with a reminiscing look wondering if my family would know if Im dead or if Im just gone from existence and was never there in the first place. I wonder if...I can ever return one day. May you be blessed with life. Please announce your name and purpose for your visit. I am Aristia la Monique and this is my twin YN la Monique. We wish to read any oracles from the past few months. Aristia stated. There is nothing as such. The oracle from 5 years ago was the most recent one. I look at Aristia with concern and see her face quite disrupted I cant really blame her after all her plan is already not going well. Then we would like to read all the oracles from the past 10 years Aristia stated. I will show you to the prayers room.As we were walking to the prayer room I took a peek to see Aristia with a really serious look. So just to make her relax a little I decided to make a little joke. Aristia if you keep narrowing your eyebrows youre gonna get wrinkles at this age. I mean this is something my parents always tells me so Im gonna pass my knowledge to her. Aristia just looks as me and blinks before turning away to silently laugh. Its been 4 hours since Aristia started looking through the oracles unable to find the thing she was looking for. I have no idea how I survive sitting there without my phone or anything really for that long.What are we doing here anyway I decided to ask even though I kinda know the answer. Aristia turn around and look at me YN...sorry you were dragged along it must be boring for you right Aristia gave me an apologetic look.I shook my head It was my decision to come however I think Ill be going to a prayer room instead of sticking around now. I said as I leave the room. Aristias P.O.V As YN left the room I look back down at the book and sigh. What should I do now There is nothing that suggests anything about my situation.Suddenly a whoosh could be heard and the scenery around me had changed. You are here my child. a mysterious voice suddenly said. YNs P.O.V I think it was time for that stupid god to meet Aristia anyways I thought as I walk to the prayers room. I wonder if Ill get to meet the person who sent me here. I thank the person who guided me here and walked in. I took a look at the statue and close my eyes. It was then that I feel the wind around me. Wind How could there be wind in here I thought. I open my eyes and look around just to notice the scenery had change there is a blue sky and a few birds flying in the sky. And most importantly there was no one and there was nothing but grass and flowers on the open ground. Then I heard a voice. Hello my dear the voice said. Who are you I ask. Im the person who sent you here my dear. the voice said again. Why did you send me here I ask very curiously. This is where you belong my dear. And didnt you also make a wish about saving your dear Carsein the voice said once again. Am I really here because of Carsein Why did the voice meant by this is where I belong I thought hard. Dont think too much for now just appreciate what you have now. When the time comes my dear I will contact you once again. Im afraid our time is up but Ill see you in the future once again my dear and with that a bright light shine and the scenery around me change once again.When I open my eyes once again I could hear a commotion outside. My eyes widen how could I forget Aristia fainted here. I quickly run out of the room to find Aristia. I dont know why but there was a feeling in me saying that I cant let anything happen to her again. Is this...the feeling of the YN before me But I thought I was a new character that didnt fit because I wasnt in the book Whatever I can think of that later. Now I need to find Aristia.,Not Rated,Alternate Universe - Non ManhwaAlternate Universe - ReincarnationCrossovers & Fandom Fusions
https://archiveofourown.org/works/24893758,"Once More, With (A Little Bit of) Problem",People says old habits die hard. This is especially true with Aristia La Monique the only daughter of Marquess Monique currently the Crown Princess candidate of Castina Empire. She spends her wholeadmittedly not that longlife studying all sorts of things fit for an Empress. Among that one specific subject has been ingrained in her being ever since she was little etiquette.Needless to say Aristia plans to no longer being excellent at it.So why why does the Emperor is still watching her with fond eyes even when she spilled the tea literally and figuratively being a concubine who was doing an Empress job has its perks namely knowing the dirt of nobles on purpose This was not the sign of a graceful Empress But the Emperor was patting her head and she had to admit it was kind of nice.Also as far as she remembers the current Emperor was always nice to her.Pouting Aristia sit back on her chair. This shortlunchturnedteaparty in the garden between her her father and the Emperor was supposed to be short but it was already an hour and they are still talking. Ruve the Crown Prince and her future NOThusband if she can help it was also supposed to be present but he was running late. Secretly Aristia prayed that she does not have to see his ugly mug today.No the little voice inside her head whispers you know Ruveliss is very handsome. Jokes on you little voice inside my head you will find that a mans level of attractiveness decreased a lot the moment they killed you. Back to the current situation Aristia notes that even Duke Lars the Emperors brotherinlaw was already present. Duke Verita is also here. Together the two Dukes and Marquess is the most influential aristocrat in the proemperor faction of Castina Empire. Anyone else would kill to attend this level of tea party but not the current Aristia. This tea party is so boring Aristia could cry. Do not get her wrong she iswasalways excellent in hosting and attending such events but it does not make it less boring. It only made her better at hiding her boredom. In fact Aristia was thinking of 101 ways to torment Ruve until his head became as bald as babys bottom when the four adults starting to talk about tax. She remembers from her past life regarding the tax problem and absentmindedly commented the solution which in her first life was originally proposed by Duke Veritas genius second son Allendis de Verita.One thing lead to another the moment she remembers that she was supposed to lay low was when she predicted there will be famine in the upcoming years. Needless to say the Emperor and all three nobles present was impressed.It is hard indeed to be blessed with a great brain and knowledge of the future.Much less great when the topic changed and suddenly the Emperor interrogated her regarding the meaning of receiving name from a God. The right to the throne thats what the Emperor was talking about. He was measuring whether Aristia was a threat for the Crown Princes right to rule. As if. I would give it back if I can. With all due respect Your Majesty. I am disinterested to contest The Crown Prince to the throne much less being an Empress. That name was not a gift from God but an apology. An apology Aristia does not accept.You claimed not interested of being a ruler of this empire yet you provided solution because deep in your heart you cannot stand seeing the people suffer. The Emperor pointed out.The old Aristia might be that person. But this Aristia was just bored. This Aristia also loves to keep her head intact though so she keeps her silence.... and that was what makes you perfect as an Empress. the Emperor continued to Aristias dismay. It got worse though. The Emperor continued by basically saying that he had done a terrible job raising his son her firsthand experience can confirm this is true and his arrogant son will react badly if paired with such an intelligent woman mysoginistic little shit but also true also if his son found out that Aristia has the right to inherit the throne he will react badly to the news anger management issues there also true. ...so it is best if Aristia become the Crown Princes concubine. he finished.come againConcubine. You see since you have the right to the throne it is impossible for you to be married off to other noble family since they will grow too strong I cannot send you to other country but promoting you as the Empress is worrying me due to the circumstances I told you before. So concubine it is.There is a phrase called Pull the rug from under someone which roughly means to suddenly take away important support from someone and that phrase is applicable in current situation Aristia thought if the someone is yours truly and the entity doing the pull of aforementioned rug is both God Vita and The Emperor. All those talk about pioneer of her own destiny all those praise of how she would make a great empress and yet here she was again to be made a concubine. All the pain she went through all the people she lost means nothing in the end. What a joke. This is NOT what she signed up for If she ended up executed again this second life she wants a refund damn itDespite the turmoil inside her head Aristia lifts her head to smile sweetly at the Emperor.Why dont you just kill me already Your Majesty forgive me but I will have to decline.Uh Dear I think youre confusing the word youve spoken with the one in your mind. Keirean nervously said to his daughter.The Emperor is understandably unable to reconcile that sweet angelic smile with her contradictory words. What is it dear It seems like I missed what you were saying.Confused and has agerelated hearing loss it seems Aristia distantly thoughts while moving to kneel in front of the Emperor. Pardon me Your Majesty. She started As your loyal subject your wish is my law and my command. But please forgive me that I cannot comply in this one matter. I Aristia La Monique was bestowed the name Pioneer by God Vita Himself as the one to create my own path. Thus I would gladly give up my right to the throne to walk this path.Pioneer the Emperor mused on the name bestowed to the little lady in front of him. What an apt name for such a little girl whose bravery exceed those beyond her age. He can imagine what a great empress she would become and together with Ruveliss the future of Castina Empire would be bright indeed. And what is this path you would like to walk My Dear The path you deemed so important that you denied my law and my command the Emperor ask not unkindly.Ever since that day in the Sanctus Vita Aristia has been thinking long and hard regarding her destiny and her future this time around. In the future that never was she was never being her own self always someone elses. She was never just Aristia she was the daughter of House Monique then the Crown Princess then the Concubine. All of her achievement was for a dream built around Ruveliss for his love was the one thing she wanted the most. This time around while she is happy as the Daughter of House Monique she wants to have a dream of her own. To live for herself.She raised her eyes to meet the Emperors to show her sincerity. She knows from her heart that this is truly what she wanted that this is the path she wants to walk no matter what.I would like to be my fathers heir. I want to be Marquess Monique. Needless to say her statement caused uproar among everyone who attended the shortlunchturnedteaparty including her own father who bless his newfound doting father behavior expressed his support to her aspiration. If nothing else this time around Aristia is secured in her fathers affection and she would die happy with that knowledge.The Emperor still insisted though so Marquess Keirean proposes to postpone the decision until Aristia comes of age.Which is not very ideal but it will do for now. It means she has six years to prove herself as the heir of Marquess Monique and if possible torture Ruveliss until his pretty hair all messed up and not in a fun way. Aristia never considers herself as a person who holds grudges but she definitely held some grudges at this point. Funny how being decapitated changed your way of thinking ehAristia sighs and stops her walking right in front of a big tree in the middle of the garden. After her outburst and the subsequent confusions that follows she was escorted to a guest sitting room while waiting for her father to finish his business in the palace. However considering what just happened with the Emperor was very stressful for her delicate psyche she needs fresh air. A lot of it. Thankfully she saw this garden on the way so she sends one of her escort to inform her father that she will be waiting here in the garden.She remembers this garden. To be exact she remembers that this particular garden was no longer exist when she was living in the palace. In the first timeline there was a fire accident causing this whole section of garden was burned to ashes. Later they changed it into a flower garden but they were not able to save this central tree. Aristia is putting her palm on the trees bark softly whispering while resting her forehead on it.This time you have to survive too.She stays that way for some moments closing her eyes and just enjoying the soft breeze the woody scent and calming presence of an old tree. It made her feel grounded made her remembers how it feels to be at peace again andWhos thereOf course the peace was ruined by the devil himself.Aristia hesitated to turn around still trying to convince herself that she was not hearing Ruvelisss voice.Arent you Lady Monique he asked again since Aristia was still silent. He can recognize that silver hair anywhere though.Steeling her resolve Aristia plastered a bland smile on her face then turn around to curtsy towards the person who haunts her nightmare. Greetings to the little sun of the empire. It is indeed I Aristia La Monique. Please forgive me for not realizing your presence immediately.Ruveliss currently still Crown Prince raised his hand You do not need to be so formal with me after all we will be betrothed.Did you Aristia wanted to ask if Ruveliss already heard about todays commotion but she made a mistake of looking up towards his face. It was instant regret on her part because one even if she does hold a grudge towards this particular person it does not mean his face suddenly turned into an orc. In fact he is still handsome as ever with that dark blue hair and clear blue eyes. He looks cuter even since this Ruvellis is still a teenager who has yet done anything horrible in his life.But I heard you dare refusing the betrothal. While his face is still impassive his voice has turned colder. And reason number two he is still a little shit nonetheless. In another story Aristia would be terrified of hearing that cold remarks. She would not be able to speak much less answering the implied question. She would tremble on the spot biting her lips to keep herself from crying. But this Aristia she faced the God Himself. She forgoes her deference and complained and being angry at the fate she was thrown into. If she dared destroying a Gods altar then you bet she DARED refusing this sham of a betrothal.She raised her eyes to look directly into Ruvelisss eyes. I am sure Your Highness already heard of it but let it be clear that I am not interested to be a concubine. I Aristia La Monique WILL be the heir of House Monique. Belatedly remembering Ruvelisss insecurity regarding his secretly illegitimate status Aristia added In short the problem lies not with you but with me.Well in this case the problem is definitely you though Aristia mused.Ruveliss scoffed So you think being my concubine is beneath you huh Does this guy listens to a word I said This is so frustrating. Pardon me Your Highness but I did not say that.It was implied.Aristia took a deep breath why she used to fall head over heels over this man is beyond her. Secretly she cursed her old self who was so easily charmed by a handsome face and brooding disposition. This time around if she had to choose she would choose someone morecheery. Very well Your Highness. She said taking out a pen and paper from her secret pocket what is the use of all that ruffles and frills on her gown if she cannot hide a thing or two inside Also she wants to be prepared in case she has to suddenly written a statement letter to release her right for the throneKindly tell me what is your view regarding my refusal to be your concubine.Iare you actually writing this Ruveliss asked confusion clear on his face seeing Aristia suddenly sit down on a stone bench nearby and roll out a piece of paper on top of it. Aristia was looking at him one eyebrow raised with expectant gazes so he cleared his throat and continue. Alright then I thinkwait your pen has no ink how do you even write with thatHearing his questions Aristia smiled at him. A little meanly Ruveliss noted.The amount of ink in this pen represents my honest feeling towards your view in this matter. Aristia said.Did you just say you did not care about my opinion Ruveliss asked incredulously.Pardon me Your Highness but I did not say that.It was impliedOh how interesting it is seeing Ruveliss lost his cool Aristia noted with satisfaction. She smiled toothily far from the elegant lady she was supposed to portray. Well this time I implied exactly that.With that she gathered her stationary and curtsied once again before taking off to find her father. It is unfortunate that she lost her waiting place but surely her father will not mind if she visits his office instead. As Aristia sashayed away from the garden one thought cross Ruvelisss mind This engagement is doomed. Aristias initial plan of NOT attracting attention has failed but the extent of this failure only became clear a few days later when someone unexpected came knocking to her estate door.It happened unfortunately when Aristia was having her extra special bath namely soaking inside the bathtub with water mixed with rose oil and rose petals. Ever since she came back to her past she realized the importance of taking a welldeserved break and while having the privilege as a rich noble daughter enjoying the aforementioned break to the fullest. Hence the floral bath which is not only rejuvenating her health but also helping her mind to be more peaceful.And peace peace is what she sorely needed lately.Being a Marquess has amazing perks but as any other prestigious job nobody really talks about the downside and the hard work that comes before and during the job itself. Her father is the textbook definition of workaholic in both timelines even though currently Aristia exerted her daughterly charm to get her father to catch breaks here and there. Not only that but being Marquess Monique means one has the power to command the army.Hence her first obstacle to be the next Marquess Monique she has to be knighted.Granted being knighted and eventually becoming Marquess Monique means she has to vow loyalty to the royal family but she has no qualm of being loyal to the Emperor. She just does not want to be his wife.But she digressed.The main issue is a female knight is very rare much less a female head of a noble family and with a very good reason the written and physical exam is notoriously difficult. Now while she has full confidence in her brain her brawn is sadly lacking in comparison. Even now while splashing her arm with the roseinfused bath water she laments in how thin and muscleless her arm is.Well but at least now she smells divine if she can say so herself.A knock on her bathroom door alerted her of a maid coming inside.Excuse me My Lady you have a guest. The Maid which Aristia does not recognize said after Lina let her in.Who is itSir Allendis de Verita My Lady. He is now waiting in the guest room.Aristia cursed inwardly she thinks she know what this is about. Please convey my apology that he has to wait a little bit longer. He came at the most unfortunate timing Im afraid.Later Lina would think her request of being dolled up beautifully is due to Aristia having fond feelings towards Allendis de Verita. Personally Aristia need to look pretty and fragile so if the young Sir Verita has understandably hostile feeling towards her due to her stealing his tax reform ideas he would think twice before executing such feeling into action.Now looking at herself in front of the hallway mirror before entering the guest room Aristia wonders if Lina dolled her up too much because she looks positively radiant today. Not to mention the divine floral scent due to her earlier bath.Lina isnt this too much just to greet a guestLina bless her heart gushed at her beauty again with glittering eyes. Anyone will fall in love with My Lady if you look like this.At this Aristia sighs. Having a devoted ladyinwaiting is great but sometimes it seems like Lina forgot that tender age of ten is not the appropriate age to have romantic love. In any case it is too late to back up now. With that determination in her mind Aristia signaled to Lina to open the door.Sir Allendis de Verita is as expected has green hair and green eyes just like his father. In fact he looks like the mini version of his father down to the brilliant mind behind those glittering eyes. Maybe their bloodline was touched by woodland fairies once upon a time.Greetings Sir Verita. I am terribly sorry for making you wait so long.Please call me Allendis Lady Monique. It is my fault for coming unannounced. He said but then he continued after taking a good look at how radiant Aristia was But it seems like the waiting is worth it.Aristia smiled but of course In that case please call me Aristia. It is nice to meet you. she said extending the back of her hand which was accepted by Allendis who kissed it.After both of them are seated Aristia signaled to Lina to bring the tea brewing set. I know you were provided with refreshments but as my apology of making you wait please allow me to serve you tea. She said inserting the dried tea leaves inside the pot I blended this myself by mixing several types of tea leaves from the eastern continent. I hope you enjoyed it.You seem to be very adept at this. Allendis commented. From the way he looks he was positively fascinated with the girl in front of him. Aristia smiled politely at him.Her smile was dazzling.Now while we are waiting for the tea to steep is there anything you wish to tell me AllendisAllendis de Verita has been lauded as a prodigy for his whole life. Blessed with the good fortune of being born in one of the most influential family in Castina Empire he also inherited his fathers good looks on top of his genius brain. He has certain thirst for knowledge and there were no one in his age group that can match his brilliant mind. However one day his father told him about Lady Monique who gave the Emperor a solution for their tax problem exactly like what he was going to propose to his father. This intrigued him to say the least.This is also why him the second son of the esteemed Duke Verita sitting here in the Monique guest room being dazzled by a little girl. Nobody told him that Aristia la Monique is this angelic little girl with soft silver hair cascading on her back and striking goldencolored eyes. Not to mentions she smelled like a royal garden making him wants to take a deep breath to fill his lungs with this aroma. And on top of her being beautiful intelligent and smells wonderful she is also good at brewing tea Allendis noted taking a sip from the cup given to him by Aristia.I see so you are here regarding my tax reform ideas Aristia asked after Allendis finished his story.Correct. I think the solution you offered was impressive. Allendis told her.Well actually it was your idea so you were the one whos impressive Aristia thought. She took another sip of her tea then But isnt it so obvious I am sure you already thought of similar solution yourself it was just that I had earlier chance to tell it to His Majesty.My Lady flatters me too much.Oh no no Sir Allendis. Even I have heard of your brilliant mind and I have no doubt this tax reform solution is a small thing for you. Im afraid this is the extend of my ability. Aristia said playing the role of a weak shy girl. She really wished Allendis will drop this matter as soon as possible because well she does not actually come up with that solution. If he were to prolong the discussion he would know that Aristia is a smart girl but not THAT smart.Allendis watched the girl in front of him with interest. Slowly he come closer until he can feel her breath hitting his face. Allendis alarmed Aristia softly called the person sitting so close to her. Allendis smiled That is the problem isnt it Anyone else will not even be able to GUESSED a fraction of that plan. You even predict the worst case scenario that would come after the original tax plan. ThisOh no is he going to say what I thought he was going to say Aristia moved until she hit the backrest trying to put more distance between them.This is the first time I met a girl like you. He really said it. Oh no. Add that grin on Allendiss face along with the clear interest in his pair of green eyes made Aristia realized that her plan of not attracting attention has failed spectacularly. Oh God Vita how is this my life I just want you to know that this time it is not my fault Child.Aristia is unsure whether that voice echoing in her mind was truly God Vitas or it was just the sound of her lost sanity. Either way her current life plan does not work as well as it should be.,Not Rated,Alternate Universe - Canon DivergenceTragedy/ComedyOut of CharacterAristia knows what's upFluff and Crack
https://archiveofourown.org/works/27119444,Stories from The Marchioness series,Ilya thought that she was done for.Her family her faction her lifeit was all done for the moment Aristia La Monique decided that she wouldnt even fight for what has been her duty since birth. Ilya hated her hated the fact that Aristia had brought the Imperial faction closer together only to destroy it at the most inopportune moment when her place as the future Empress was compromised by some girl who appeared out of thin air.It crossed Ilyas mind not to come. Not to adhere to the summons that came to her in a form of silverandblue letters. The letter bore no sender but the colorings were too distinct to be ignored. Ilya was surprised to see Enteya Niave and the other children of the Imperial factions family gathered at the gates of Monique Manor.They all seemed surprised to see her too. She knew that everyone was surprised to even receive the summons from the Silver Lions.The servants showed them to a gazebo by the garden. It was spacious enough for all of them to sit around whilst being served with brunch. The food was exquisite of course but the most impressive thing at that party was not the foodit was the two people who joined their gatherings with determined eyes.Carsein De Rass was famous for his swordsmanship but he was just as famous for his easygoing demeanor and general lack of decorum. Ilya has heard rumors of him not sitting at the head of gathering tables even when he was part of the House Rass but he took the seat at the head of their table with a sense of despair clinging on his shoulders. Glassblue eyes looked tired as he waved his hand and asked them to sit down.Allendis De Verita though did not intend to sit at all. He stood next to Sir Carsein his eyes sweeping all of them as if noting their attendance.Very well no one important is amiss. House Reed and House Fraens absence is not unnoticed though well deal with them later. Sir Allendis spoke his cold tone reflecting nothing of the warm boy Aristia once talked to her about. All of you here are the notfirstborns of your family eager to fill in those seats of power. Thank you for responding to the letter I sent with my ladys stationery my name is Allendis De Verita.If they were to go about to etiquette of social gatherings his way of addressing Aristia did not make sense whatsoever. But Ilya noticed something from the way these two behave. This isnt an ordinary gathering this was something else. This was a meeting that will determine the future of the Imperial faction. Ilya felt a little silly for expecting protocols to be followed when this gathering in itself was already a breach of protocols. Here they were in the gardens of House Monique headed by a Rass yet called upon by a Verita. Ilya sat straighter her face carefully maintained to a neutral expression.It is hard for an Imperialist to not respond to a silver letter Ilya took out her fan. But I still have to inquire Lord De Verita for what reason have you summoned us hereEveryone else shared the same look of curios neutrality.Lord Allendis smiled.Simple. Im going to become the Marquess of House Monique and I would like to offer you all a deal.Ilya couldnt help but drop her fan to the table.Listen first Sir Carsein quipped as he put his hand on the table. Everyone took his cue not to talk and let the greenhaired boy talk.As you all have probably heard Aristia is sick he sounded bitter but it was Sir Carseins expression of cold anger that earned Ilyas attention first and foremost. There is no telling for how long she will be out of commission but I am not intending to let my ladys work go to waste. In here I have the plans my lady had crafted in case Vitas beloved child ever come to our world. They are extremely detailed and comprehensive and it mentioned all of you as part of it. My plan is simple I will marry Aristia took on the name Monique and turn this empires economy over to our faction so the aristocrats will have no power over the royal family.Everyone was stunned including Ilya herself. But Enteya cleared her throat and raised her hand. Its intriguing and no doubt a beneficial plan for us she said as she opened her fan. But just how are you going to achieve that while dealing with the aristocrats Empress Lady JennaWe wont deal with her Sir Carsein spoke his voice was bizarrely cold. This is the reason why we called upon the second and thirdborns instead of the firstborns. This plan will probably destroy the balance of power between the Imperialist and the Aristocrats weve known for the last few years completely for a few years he took a deep breath and Ilya found herself letting go of the breath she didnt even know she was holding. We will let the balance of power between the Imperials and the Aristocrats fall in the royal palace. Of course we will be setting our roots in the empires business world but for the court politics we will show everyone that we are carefree kids who cant do anything about our factions fall. And when the time comes His eyes went over to Sir Allendis who nodded.When the time comes we will purge the Aristocrats from this empire. The man finished.It was surreal of course. Ilya knew little of Sir Allendis De Verita most of what she knew had come from her betrothed Sir Alexis. But she never pegged him for the type of noble whod harbor a grudge for the Aristocratsmay I ask why you are doing this sir Niaves voice was small and quivering but it was clear that she was sounding everyones question. Ilyas eyes were level but the cold cold fury that came from her future inlaw was starting to scare her.Someone has to pay for what happened to my lady. Come everyone let me show you why Im going to burn the empire to the ground.But Sir Carsein was the one who stood up his expression matched the fury on Sir Allendis face. No. He seethed through his teeth. What the hell are you thinking weedhair What if Aristia had another episodeThink Carsein. Theyre Tias friends. If they can see and understand for themselves why were going for such a long and risky gamble maybe theyll be more willing to destroy ourtheir familys status quo. The air was thick and heavy with tension to the point that Ilya found it hard to breathe but Sir Carsein eventually took a deep breath.Ill bring her here. I dont want to bring people over to her bedroom and risk making her feel that her room is unsafe. With that he left.Aristia La Monique was a proud daughter of House Monique. She hasnt quite entered the social world since she hasnt had her debut but she wasnt in a hurry to have friendly gatherings either. The only time Ilya had seen her was when she has to accompany His Highness the Prince for his official parties but she knew that Lady Aristia was by no means weak.It was precisely why she felt both pity and fury at the people who had reduced her into this.Lady Aristia Niave was the one who had knelt in front of the chair Sir Carsein had put her on. Lady Aristia can you hear me Its Niave your friend Aristia didnt even seem to realize that she was spoken to as she kept on staring at something no one else can see. She was gaunt and pale her eyes had dark circles underneath and she was startlingly skinny. Ilya was sure that the only reason why Aristia was dressed in a longsleeved dress that covered her from neck to ankle was to prevent them from noticing how she had been reduced to mere skin and bones. It was a truly pitiful sight to see the very girl who had stood up to the ladies of Aristocrats just a few months prior be in this state.Enteya had bitten her lower lip so hard that it had bled. Everyone was angry to see their kind and brilliant leading lady in such state.Do you understand now Sir Allendis said as he knelt in front of Aristias chair tucking a loose strand of dull silver hair behind her ear. Sir Carseins grip on the handle of the wheelchair was unnervingly tight but he said nothing. Do you understand why were willing to raze this Empire into the ground if we have toIlya noted the plural usage but she nodded anyway. If she was angry at the aristocrats for reducing Aristia to this state she really couldnt imagine what these two must feel to see the person they love wither away in a fate worse than death every single day. Ilya wasnt deaf about the rumors about their relationship of course but she didnt even care that it was true.Ilyas eyes went to her fellow nobles who all gave her a silent nod. They would do this. For their proud lady who would have done the same for them for their friend.We will help you my lords. For our friend Lady Aristia La Monique.,Not Rated,the missing scenes of The Marchioness series

RegrettingREGRETTING EVERY THING THAT I DID IN MY PAST LIFEWhy Because I want to promise to be a begger version of myself if I ever go back to my last life. Why Because I am in hell now You might have guessed but I have time travelled in a novel called Abandoned Empress. When I first arrived here hearing familiar names of maids and other stuff made me realise that I had woken up in this novel that I finished reading just before going to sleep. I thought I was lucky many hot boys to form a relationship with I was dreaming of fangirling over everyone when suddenly...I got to know a shocking news I already knew that I was in abandoned Empress but WHY FROM THE FIRST TIMELINE Why A maid actually called me queen and thats when I realised I was 17 year old Aristia before she reincarnated. I had just lost my child due to that shitty Dukes plan and now I was unable to bear children.I guess here something happened and due to a shock Aristia died early than expected. Wait So that meant that I was going to be executed in a few months NooooooooDamn Of all the things I was born as the queen in the messed up time line No way I was gonna accept this. So I decided to make myself a bit more loveable. But I would not bend like Aristia towards shitty people. I thought of running away at first but...My queen I heard a knock on the door. Who is it Come in as I said these words a man with silver hair rushed inside he had blue eyes and was fairly handsome. Wait a minute Thats the infamous Papa Keiran . Oh yeah He must be worried about Aristia. My queen I heard you fainted... He said grabbing my shoulders though he was speaking normally I could see a faint sadness in his eyes like he would have just cried. His daughter had fainted for some hours and he was this worried what would have happened if I would have run away I started to feel guilty for having that idea earlier. Thats that Still... I cant deny this fact that he is handsome af. This makes me want to have a one night stand with him. But for the father who lost his real daughter...I moved towards him and gave him a light hug my face buried in his chest. He stiffens a bit but does not push me away. I remember that Aristias father also died for harming the Empress. Well I would have to warn this guy... To go somewhere for a while otherwise he would end up dying. Father I have a request. Yyes my queen Dont do anything rash calm down for a month. Please... I look up at him with pitiful eyes. My queen I dont quiet... Dont die. Dont kill. Stay still.

I. AM. NOT. DOING THE. SHITTY. EMPRESSS. WORK According to the laws of the empire a queen is only a supporter to the empress when she would not be well or might have some other problem. If the Empress is forcing the queen to work in her stead without any problems then the queen has the right to stand up against it. In abandoned Empress Aristia loved that shit head so much that she did all of the Empresss work without saying anything. I am not head over hells for him neither do I love charity if I am going to do the Empresss work at least pay me that muchI have hence asked an audience to either pay me more for work or to give that bitch to do her own work by providing an aide. This really pisses me off acting like a slave of love. I have hence decided that I would fangirl and take my rights back from me. This messed up empire I am going to make it better....As I was thinking this the doors of the throne room opened and I was summoned and announced. As I went it I saw a queer scene in front of me were my father with a stoic face but so handsome .

https://archiveofourown.org/works/31410269,Pray for the Wicked,It is true that the Underworld is a world. It is not a conventional world not one that can be reached with a simple Gummi ship. However it is a plane of existence as are all the worlds of the dead that link to it. There are two ways to truly enter the Underworld to be a Chthonic deity or have one as your patron and to have died. For Pete the circumstance was unfortunately the latter. Hed failed Maleficent his alliance with Morgana le Fay doomed and his power play in Enchancia thwarted by the most aggravating of villainous upstarts. Maleficent had then ushered in several new recruits who needed to see what would happen if one did indeed fail. Pete had been made into an example poisoned to death by strangling thorny vines. And now he was here. A shade wandering Hades domain. This stinks he grumbled to himself as he kicked a rock. Everything around seemed to be gloomy and blue. Hed heard once there was some sort of rhyme or reason as to which afterlife youd end up in but for the life of him he couldnt recall exactly what the sorting system was. He supposed he was here because he was Hades friend. Had been Hades friend. He definitely wasnt getting any handouts from the god now. Hed already tried only to be met with a thicket of barbed chains emblazoned with a NO PETES ALLOWED sign. It looked like the others of his former alliance wanted him to stay dead at least for now. Maybe theyd change their mind later At the very least he hadnt been condemned to Tartarus. That was good. Seemed like a nasty place judging by all the screaming. He seemed to be free to wander as he saw fit and so was taking a walk of the perimeter. Or had been anyway. Now he was just lost. But this was the beginning of another tale to be told. Yes so many of them seem to begin in the Underworld but only because every beginning must be born from another storys end. Where Pete was the other souls seemed to stay away from. It never occurred to Pete that this mightve been for good reason so he remarked Sure is dead in here. A pause. Well I mean you know what I mean. A pathway sloped down into a gray valley one that other souls dared not enter. At the base of this valley was a pit that emitted a distinctive red glow. Wonder what that is Pete muttered. Hey Maybe its a way out So he lumbered toward it at his highest speed. The closer he got the more he realized that might not have been the best idea. There was also a distinctive amount of heat emanating from the pit and on top of that now Pete was starting to hear screams. Tartarusstyle screams. Is there anywhere around this place where a fella can get some peace and quiet Pete grumbled though his pace slowed laden with apprehension. Whatever was in that hole it wasnt good. He stopped altogether every instinct in his soul telling him to make an aboutface and leave now. Maybe this wasnt such a good idea It was too late. For there was a figure crawling up out of the pit. Pete froze in terror. What in all the worlds could possibly be spit from that red maw of horror Why it could be any number of horrors A demon a dragon a devilish lord even the legendary Master Octomus But what it appeared to be was something far more human. An elderly man hoisted himself onto the edge of the ground above the pit nearly collapsing. His chromecolored hair was tousled his black robes stained red with blood. A bloodstained sword clanged to the ground beside him dropped from his hand. At last he panted in a voice rich like honey. I haveI have proven my virtueno longer can the fires of Hell hold meas never they should have Whoa whoa hang on a minute Pete interrupted. The man flinched recoiling he hadnt realized there was another. Are you sayin thats the pit to HECK Pete asked. The man scowled. You speak of it with no fear no respect. Had you just fought your way through each and every ring of the punishment of sinners as I have done then you might be singing a different tune. You just fought your way outta heck Petes eyes were wide. Thats no mean feat The man was wresting himself to his feet already quite tired of this entire discussion. I was not meant to be among the damned he stated. That conviction I held in my soul. It was what allowed me to take up the blade and begin my sacred mission to save my own soul. Not to mention that when one is faced with eternal torment one also has an eternity to figure out an escape. Pete was many things. For instance an opportunist. And also rather stupid. These two things combined as he observed Hells refugee Heyyyy. A guy like you I could use on my team. You an me we could figure out a way to get outta this entire Underworld And why should I waste such a blessing on you the man spat. Cause like it or not youre still in the drink Pete reminded him. Sure you got outta the worst of it. But you an me were still a couple of dead souls. Which means were stuck all the way down here till some death god decides to take pity on usor we take matters into our own hands Hmph the man sniffed. A pagan. Oh Im sorry Pete mocked. Did this look like the living world to you The other didnt want to admit it but eventually relented It seems my punishment did not end in Hell. The truth is far worse than I ever realized. Huh the what now I devoted my life to our Lord the man stated proudly. I purged the world of sin in his name. He sent me his blessed angels to do his bidding the creatures of golden eyes who hide in shadow. My only crime was that I was seduced by a woman a woman who deserved to burn It was I who cleansed our city of those who did not truly believe in the Lord above And my reward for such piousness Damnation Eternal damnation He gritted his teeth. If this is what the Lord willsthen I have lost any inclination to serve Him. Perhaps giving in to the Devil would have been the more rewarding outcome loath as I am to admit it. Huh. Pete thought it over. You sure you didnt do yknow some of that bad stuff that people do in the name of all that churchy stuff My will was PURE outside of the work of that witchwoman the man growled. Though always within me raged a spark a spark that could have blossomed into the flames of Helland now I will ignite it in my final act of defiance against the Lord who shunned my devotion Pete wasnt really sure this mans will had been anything close to pure. But maybe if he played along he could get the Hellslayer to agree to his terms. Well you know whatd really tick off the big guy upstairs If we broke outta the Underworld and came back to life Indeed the man mused. An act of ultimate defiance Whaddaya say pal Pete asked extending a hand. My brains and your brawn and we blow this chicken coop The other flinched. And what reason have I to align with you Cause I know the place like the back of my hand Pete explained. Trust me I was in with one of the guys who runs this whole shindig. I got all the ins and outs Well most of em anyway. If this is not true the other threatened then you will meet your rightful end at my sword. Uhgood luck with that one pal Pete sighed. Maybe demons could be killed by the dead but Pete was pretty sure dead couldnt kill other dead. But youre saying youre in right I suppose Names Pete Pete said proudly retracting his hand which it was obvious his new partner wasnt going to shake and using it to thumb at himself. And whore you The man drew himself up as tall as he could be. Minister Claude Frollo. All of Vinyl City heard the news when its most infamous criminal escaped jail. After all the wounds from when Kliff had attempted to crash the No Straight Roads satellite into the citys central tower were still fresh. Had the satellite impacted then more than just his intended target wouldve been destroyed a whole district of the city couldve been wiped out. Hed known that of course. It was a small price to pay to show up Tatiana to make her regret taking her art away from him. While the NSR Charters had admitted to a tyrannical hold over the city theyd at least made an effort to heal what theyd hurt to try and give back to their districts by allowing new creative freedoms. Kliff had stood by what hed done. He had orchestrated a rock revolution in order to tear down the current government that ran on EDM and even when it seemed that both genres produced equal energy to the musicpowered city it had all fed into his overall desire to make Tatiana pay. Because shed given up her name her music her genre and thrown away the loyalty of her fans of which he had no doubt he was the biggest. Theyd locked him up so he couldnt destroy any more of the city in a glorified tantrum. But hed waited for his opportunity and hed broken out From there all he had to do was hijack an innocent civilians highspeed moped from the Akusuka district and then he was on the run out of the bounds of the city his flamered hair and purple scarf billowing in the summer sun. The police chase was immediate. Qwazas went into overdrive firing sonic blasts intended to stun him. Hardly a person in Vinyl City wasnt watching the scene on their television. This included the android boy band 1010 who resided in Barraca Mansion in the Metro Division. The five robots crowded onto their couch gaping at the unfolding scene. He thinks hes really gonna get out of the city remarked Zimelu whose hair and accents were red. Not the city corrected PurlHew who sported a blue scheme. It looks like hes trying to flee the country. Crouched next to the television was their producer and surrogate father a whiteplated cyborg whose head was a monitor screen with cycling green radar. Neon J. lacked eyes in the traditional sense and so had a cable linked from the television to his monitor in order to view the chaos. He gave a start his radar circle seemed to expand and contract like a shocked eye. No he said hoarsely. NO NOT THAT WAY Whats wrong Captain asked the greenthemed android Eloni. Hes headed directly for the border Neon J. cried. That placeit was once a warzone I remember well the sound of gunfire when I quivered with fear upon that very ground but I steeled my resolve and I Yeah interrupted Rin the band leader whose accents were bright white but the wars over now. Way way over. No you dont UNDERSTAND Neon J. protested. There are parts of the battlefield that havent been properly cleaned up There are still ACTIVE MINES under the ground If Kliff hits one of those Then good riddance. This was from Haym the android with yellow accents. Haym Neon J. scolded. Show some respect Even the enemy deserves to be mourned and you know it He wont die PurlHew sighed. You sure Elonis voice quavered. Even the police are slowing down As Kliffs moped approached the former warzone the vehicles that gave chase indeed held back. Helicopters continued but cars hit the brakes. Kliff however showed no signs of stopping. It was clear he considered himself no less than immortal. KLIFF Neon J. yelled as though Kliff could hear him through a news camera. STOP But he didnt stop. All of a sudden in a rush of bright red light and sonorous noise Kliff learned that he was not in fact immortal. The androids gaped at the screen. One minute hed still been leading the law on a perilous chase and then Kliff public menace number one was dead with hardly anything remaining of the body. All thanks to a buried piece of metal and gunpowder. There was silence. Then Neon J. disconnected his cable shutting off the television entirely. Weve seen enough troops he said softly solemnly. The way through the Underworld wasnt easy. Pete and Frollo passed several portals that would have brought them to other afterlives other offshoots. But they did not want to simply arrive in another land of the dead. At last hidden beyond a barren wasteland there was something a little closer to the goal. The passage to the Netherworld. A realm for the dead as they walked on the same worlds as the living in a plane of existence that no mortal eye could see. To get there they first had to pass through a strange realm a barren expanse of water that stretched into an eternal horizon like a salt flat. But then a new sparkling portal became clear and the two wandering souls found themselves in a world that was not an afterlife. TADAAAAAA Pete gestured out to the world they were now ghosts upon slipping through the fabric of life and death. Welcome to HUH THIS PLACE He and Frollo stood atop a set of wide flat stairs leading from one level of brown cobblestone to another. Wooden buildings with distinctive Victorian flourishes surrounded them brightlylit signs labeled an Accessory Shop among others. Frollo sniffed. What a garish little town. I dont get it. Pete scratched his head. Thiss gotta be here cause Hades or somebody who works with him hooked it up to be the first Netherworld youd get to. But why this place The sound of fluttering wings. Hush Frollo whispered sensing it. His hand went to the hilt of the blade on his hip. Ohhh Pete said knowingly. Then very loudly WELL AT LEAST ITS A TOTALLY NORMAL PLACE WHERE WE CAN TAKE A REST FOR A WHILE A whoosh. Something descended. Pete turned quickly and pummeled his fist directly into it. A humanoid form shot back from it straight across the cobblestone head over heels. A white mask with only dark eyes and mouth carved in tumbled off the assailants face leaving him clad in black robes. A knife also skittered across the stone. When the attacker hit the wall of the nearby caf√© he came to a halt then lay there for just a moment thinking all sorts of obscenities. Heheheh Pete guffawed. That guy thought he could get the drop on us Howd you know he was one of the bad guys anyhow I can always sense the presence of a demon Frollo stated smugly. Instantly the man was on his feet. Or perhaps boy was more accurate he seemed on the older end of teenagers with a little bit of dirtyblond scruff and bangs that fell into his newlyexposed eyes. Not demon he corrected with a smirk. Reaper. Or Shinigami if you want the technical term. I have already slain hundreds of your kind Frollo warned. No the boy corrected. You killed hundreds of demons. Im assuming. Dead souls can kill demons. They cant kill Reapers. Reapers kill dead souls all over again. I can send you right back to whichever afterlife you started in if I want. Frollo flinched. Then Youre BLUFFING. Why come after us huh pal Pete made a fist. We didnt do anythin to ya Yet. I know the boy said with a shrug. I just like the thrill of the hunt. Ever since the other Reapers vacated Ive finally been free to do what I want. No rules. The only problem isno UG means no fresh blood. Until you. You will speak proper French this instant Frollo snapped. Thats what you think youre speaking isnt it the boy mocked. His wiry black wings shuffled refolding behind his back. Its all the same in here. French English Japanesenow I can threaten anyone in any language. Who could ask for more Now hold the phone Pete snapped. Whats all this youre talkin about Reapers UG Who left Why Answer me Why should I the boy asked cockily. Cause if ya dont Pete growled ya get another knuckle sandwich. He drew back winding up. The boy the Reaper actually flinched. He can be threatened by the dead after all Frollo said smugly. Let me ask you this question instead the Reaper said. Why are you here What are you looking to gain from all this What is rightfully mine Frollo seethed. A return to mortal fleshand affirmation that I have been driven to this wretched state by the neglect of our own Lord. Im lookin to get outta here too Pete added. That way I can get back to conquerin and the whole powerrichesrevenge combo I must admit Frollo said in this light I cannot say power riches or especially revenge is a dissuasion. Power riches revenge the Reaper repeated. And murder If it is necessary to our greater goal Frollo answered. What he said Pete nodded agreement. The Reaper laughed. You just might be all right. He turned to look out over the First District of Traverse Town. This is a world for people who need somewhere else to go. A jerk manchild from another world came here looking for a place to stick his friendsbecause hed blown up their world. He wanted so badly to make up for the destruction that he caused moments after hed caused it. I cant believe anyone could be so hypocritical and not justrevel in it. Anyway they called him Joshua. Joshua Kiryu. But officially he was the Composer. In his world he turned the Netherworld into a giant game. Souls would play to either come back to life or get shoved into the next afterlife. Or erased if you really messed up. When he came here he turned this Netherworld into the same thing. The UG or Underground. He brought all his little Reaper friends set up the game so his friends could play for all eternity without realizing how much he ruined them. And thats where I came in. You could say I was justpassing through after I was horribly murdered. He sniffed haughtily. By an amateur who used dirty tactics. But I played nice and then Joshua let me in on his little game. He claimed to be omniscient but he didnt realize for so long that I was reaping souls right out of his clutches It got down to so few from that worldI think he had a crush on one of them so his claws came out. But Im good at what I do. He thought it was someone else. Another pair of Reapers. He waved his magic hands brought them back to life and now the garbageman and his little sister cant play anymore. But he never caught me. Oh he found out it was me. I let him know. I watched the horror in his face as he realized Id been picking off so many of his little friends. He tried to end me on the spot. There were four special ones he just didnt want dead. I welcomed the challenge. But then he conspired with an angel to bring their old world back to life and the ditz the dumbass the annoying kid and the one he liked all got to go back home. And me I just stayed out of sight. I stopped being the cat so I could play the mouseand let me tell you he never found the hole I was hiding in. He was smart though. Once you set up a UG you cant take it down. But the only way to become a Composer of an existing UG is to kill the last one. He just transferred his power back to his first one. This UG has no Composer. It barely has any souls in it. Its just a lawless wastelandwhich is good for me. He grinned. All I want is some bloodshed. Now hang on just a minute Pete realized. You said this game could bring people back to life You want it for you the Reaper taunted. Good luck. Theres no one to run the game and youd have to be playing it. Another god who abandoned his domain Frollo spat. Who allowed injustice to reign. Yeah wellwe cant be Composers Pete realized but we could still run the game thingy right The Reaper laughed. Im glad I didnt kill you a second time. You might be worth it after all. Yeah its possible. You will show us how to take advantage of thisgame Frollo demanded. And you will tell us your name. Its Kieran the Reaper answered. Kieran Wilcox. But the souls here they liked to give me a little nickname. Ghostface. He chuckled again. If only they knew. Im Pete Pete said and hes Claude. You will refer to me as MINISTER FROLLO Frollo seethed. Trusting me isnt a good idea. Kieran stood unfurling his wings. But if you really think I wont kill you then follow me to the River. He took off at a slow glide enough for the other two to keep pace. Be at the ready Frollo hissed. I expect this demon to turn on us the moment we let down our guard. I gotcha Pete said with a nod. One wrong move and hes toast. Kieran led them into the Second District of the town into a back street through a gate that led to a waterway within a carved green cavern. At the end of a long channel was a mural a sun and moon intertwined. The living would have had to stop there. But Kieran phased right through the mural indicating to Pete and Frollo that they could do the same. Once all three had passed through the wall they found themselves in a cavernous subterranean room like that of a chapel lit by several braziers that still couldnt quite chase all the shadows out of the buttresses above. A single throne adorned the far end of the room. Many arched doorways branched out to lead to other quarters. Kieran fluttered landed put out his arms. The walls sprang to life showing visions of the town as it currently stood. It had a few citizens the refugees of other disasters who went about a daily life as anyone would. They seemed happy. No souls but you two Kieran remarked. Not yet. But the nice thing is if one of you takes over the game you can bring them in yourself from any world you want. Reapers cant but souls can. So whats the game we make em play Pete asked. Make them team up with someone they dont like Kieran explained. Then give them tasks and set a timer. If they dont finish on timepoof And the tasks can be Pete asked. Whatever you want Kieran answered. Make you a sandwich. Cure cancer. Stab themselves in the throat if youre feeling playful. So we could use em to figure out a way to come back to life Pete realized. All we gotta do is send em on the assignments to do the hard work for us Do you not see the greater implications of what is at our hands Frollo looked nearly giddy. The Lord has abandoned us to elevate the sinners and condemn the devout. We now hold His divine power in this world alone. It is in our hands now to collect the true sinners to punish them for their misdeeds to put them through a Hell of our own design A purpose for which I would revel in working with a demon of my own. Reaper Kieran corrected. But go on. You could be an arbiter of judgment Frollo seethed a tormentor of the damned I like the way you think Pete crowed. Just uh one thing. We cant make the chores too hard or else we dont have any dead guys left I guess we could leave some standing Kieran sniffed. But I wouldnt make it too easy either. Weve gotta have a little fun around here. Well whaddaya say boys Pete suggested. Lets get to work Oh and one more thing dibs on the throne The man struggled to wakefulness in a room he knew he hadnt fallen asleep in. It was red patterned with golden dragons and swirls. A dark canopy hung above his soft mattress. All around calligraphy scrolls adorned the walls. There were two doors both red on opposite walls one with a diamond pattern in gold and one with a dragon emblem. He began to panic. He had never seen this room before. The last time he was awake hed been in Hed been in No. He didnt actually remember where hed fallen asleep. He knew it wasnt this room but he couldnt recall where he had been. Or where he was from or what hed been doing for the past few years at least Dont panic. Breathe. In out cough cough in and out. That was right. Coughing. He did it a lot. It just seemed to happen. He wasnt sick though he had the vague recollection that his immune system was worse than the average persons. What else did he remember That he didnt speak. That he looked pale as a ghost with raven hair and the dark glasses that were on his face when he woke up the white lab coat he wore those were things that were familiar. He came fromsomewhere that started with G. Many Gs he thought even though that made little sense. And hed been working with someone namedVincent No Victor. Wait no it was Vincentwasnt it And theyd been working onwell that he couldnt recall at all. His name. That was still there clear as day. Winston Loomis. And he also knew he was a bioengineer. One with the knowhow to createorganicmechanic hybrids. And apparently no guilt over doing so. Yes he liked cutting people apart and stitching them to circuitboards and that was definitely an interesting fact. On a bedside table a cell phone buzzed. His cell phone No idea. He reached over gently pressing the green onscreen button to answer it. He lifted it shakily to his ear. Maybe the person on the other line could tell him where he was and what was happening. You there Winston a raspy voice asked through the speaker. Kieran though he didnt know it. Go ahead. Speak up. Ohthats right. You cant. Okay cough if you can hear me. The coughing came out unbidden as Winston continued to tremble. Somebody obviously had him right where they wanted him and considering what crimes he had probably committed he was probably in for a hell of a punishment. Yknow Winston Kieran continued his voice modulated to obscure it from all recognition youre a guy after my own heart. You have to have realized by now youre a killer like me. The good news is I dont personally hold that against you. The bad news is were not friends. See my job here is to make sure you suffer so one of my friends gets some justice in this world. Which by the way isnt the world you live in. Winstons blood ran cold. What did that mean But you wouldnt remember that Kieran went on. After all you were a littlehazardous to the plan as you were. You had to go down all right but you dont need to know how you died or what you were doing before that. Dont worry. Weve left you just enough information to work with. Youre a smart guy. Youll figure it out. Now I bet youre wondering what youre here to do. Simple. Look at your right hand. Winston slowly lifted his pale palm. There was an angry red mark like someone had cut into his skin and scarred it. It took the shape of clock numbers 500 When I say go Kieran announced that starts counting down. You have until it ends to do what I say. Keep the phone by the way. Youll need it for the rest of the game. You dont wanna know whatll happen if you lose the phone or let yourself run out of time. The 500 mark was shaking because Winstons hand was. Your first challenge is the traditional Kieran told him. To play the game youll need a partner. Lucky for you weve put one in this town for you. See if you can find him before the clock runs down. Your soul depends on it. The 500 changed to 459. Then 458. Good luck Winston. The call ended and Winston was sent into a hacking fit nerves taking over. Oh he didnt have the time to waste on a panic attack. He needed to find this partner he was supposed to have and immediately. He threw himself out of bed hurrying to the dragon door. Locked. The diamond door opened and he found himself in the hallway of a hotel. It was easy to find the exit door from there. The sight outside stunned him. Yet again even though he couldnt remember anything about his home aside from vague recollections wasnt therea factory An office With a letter on it he knew he had never seen anything like this. He stood on an elevated walkway that lined a lowerlevel basin and all along that walkway were shops of all sorts with bright lights advertising their wares. Across the way a woman exited the shop that was marked with a strange little man on its sign lifting and lowering a green top hat. Maybe that was the partner Winston was supposed to find. Desperately he barreled toward her rounding the U of the walkway until He passed right through her. His blood ran cold. Why How He turned back attempting to grab her shoulders from behind shake her until she noticed. His coughing returned in full force. To her it was like nothing touched her nothing made noise. She simply kept walking. Winston ran after her into the First District and found himself in a small throng of people. Again and again he tried to get attention but to no avail. He was invisible intangible and his timer was almost running out. Was this some kind of sick joke Was the intent never to let him find a partner Was he just supposed to panic until he He didnt even know what fate awaited him if he failed. His reverie of doom was ended when he heard a sudden commotion. Someone at the far side of the square was singing and very loudly. It sounded like a fastpaced rock song. Well Winston was going to fail anyway. He might as well waste time figuring out what it was. He rushed after it feeling the numbers on his hand start to burn 25 24 23 A redheaded man in a yellow sweater a lengthy purple scarf and a thick pair of spectacles was bellowing his heart out in a soulful anthem. One could almost hear the roaring guitars that were supposed to back him especially because he was making a show of pantomiming playing one. He danced vibrantly yelling higher and higher notes until he was really just making an awful squawking. Then he realized Winston was watching him. OH THANK GOD He rushed toward Winston right hand out. TAKE MY HAND This man could see him. And Winston realized that the reverse was true as well. Hed obviously been assigned to find a partner in the same limited amount of time and realized he was invisible so hed made as much of a ruckus as he could because the one person in the crowd who actually took notice of it would be his destined. Clever. Winstons right hand shot out and it slapped into the redheads. The burning soothed the timers dissolved with only a second to spare on each. Phew the redhead sighed. Thatwas close. He then gave Winston a smile. Kliff. Im Kliff. Whats your name Winston just let out a cough. Kliffs face fell. Great. A buzzing of both their phones in synchrony. Kliff put up a hand Ill get it. He didnt want wheezing and coughing to be the response to their tormentor. He answered Partner Check. Now let us go. Ah ah ah Kieran taunted. Its not that easy. You want out You have to earn it. Look Kliff seethed I dont know who you think you are thinking you can threaten me Other way around Kieran corrected. Im the one who put the timer on your hand. Im the one who comes to collect if it runs out. Think about that. To put it simply I brought you into this world and I can take you right back out. Now are you going to keep sassing me or are you going to listen to how you can save your soul Kliffs expression was sour as a lime. Fine. Speak. Simply put youre dead Kieran explained. One of you remembers that. Kliff shuddered. One minute speeding across the countryside as the sirens faded behind him. Then The thing is you can die again Kieran went on. Id love to make that happen. But we can play nice. All you have to do is play the game. Follow all the orders before the timer runs out. Oh and I shouldve mentioned this earlier but check your pockets. So Kliff did. There was a button pin there. He removed it to see a black circle adorned with a white design some sort of animal its mouth wide open. It was supposed to be a minimalist relief of Pete laughing. A quick glance told Kliff that Winston had the same pin. I wouldnt lose that either Kieran said. Its your pass to play. And remember above all elseyou cant lose your partner. Or Im absolutely responsible for what happens to you. Stick with my partner Kliff repeated. Keep the phone keep the pin. What else There are some places in town that areset aside for you Kieran went on. Youll know them by the mark. People can see you in those spaces. There are also some empty holes to hide in if you can find them. And dont worry youll get some free time in between rounds. But what youre really wondering is what your next assignment is isnt it Just get this over with Kliff seethed. Theres an audio file on your phones Kieran said. Its the only recording. Listen to it and listen good after I hang up the call. Theres a concert going on in the Third District. Its scheduled to end in three hours. Before time runs out you get the band to play the song on the file. Consider it a test. We wanna see if the puppeteer of the rock revolution is worth every penny. And dont worry well have a test for the cyborg maker later. Now good luck. Youll need it. The connection went dead. Kliff hastily tried to redial the number hoping to get the jump on his captor but the phone disallowed the call. Winston on the other hand had made a strange discovery. Kliff was already programmed as a contact in his phone. All right Kliff resolved. Lets get somewhere quiet so we can listen to this song. He shrugged his way down a side street. Come on. Wouldnt want to LOSE MY PARTNER. Winston trailed after him walking with his usual hunch. As he did so he tapped Kliffs name in his phone. Kliffs own phone buzzed Oh what now He retrieved it to answer the latest taunt only to find a text message My name is Winston. Well thats a little better Kliff said. Still didnt expect to get paired with a mute but I can run with it. Oh the irony. His phone lit up with followed by Also please dont make fun of me. And then I can kill you pretty easily. Kliffs eyes widened. Maybe he was making a mistake with the bullying. After all there was already at least one madman here gunning for his guts. But then he remembered the loophole You can. But then you wouldnt have a partner. You need me and I need you. And to answer your question marks its because I come from Vinyl City music capital of the world. Rock is my life. He sighed wistfully. The things Id do to make it reign supreme. Tap tap tap. His phone read Our captor said Im not on the world I was from. You Said the same thing Kliff admitted. Not sure I believe it. Then again I never have seen this town but theres a lot in the world I havent seen. Tap tap. Kliff read the next one out loud You still have all your memories What kind of question is of COURSE I have my memories. Dont tell me I dont have mine Winston wrote. Just my name and some key details. Great Kliff sighed. I get a mute an invalid AND an amnesiac as my ball and chain. Winston tapped angrily DONT. MAKE. FUN. OF. ME. Then Maybe I cant kill you but I can make you suffer. Oh. That was true. Kliff laughed nervously I think we maybe got off on the wrong foot here. Why dont you tell me a little bit about yourself You like rock I think I like mostly anime music Winston wrote. Kliff bit back another insult. Thats a lot of that is rock so that works. Good beat. What else do you remember Our captor said I make cyborgs Winston wrote. Thats true. Im a scientist. I dont talk but you know that by now. Your grammar is excellent by the way Kliff pointed out. Im not afraid of blood and gore Winston kept on. Thats most of what I remember. What about you Were stuck together so I might as well know. Well Kliff answered I wouldve said something to dress up what I did back home but Im apparently talking to a serial killer so I might as well be honest. I wanted revenge on someone for ruining everything I cared about. So I set a satellite to crash into her city. Who Winston wrote. Her name was Tatiana Kliff said. The most beautiful woman who ever existed. She used to be Kul Fyra leader of the Goolings. That was a Goolings song I was singing to get your attention by the way. Man did that stuff ever rock. She was the best. But after her band broke up and she took power in the city well she banned rock and replaced it with He shuddered. EDM. After all her music meant to me after all it inspired me to doit was even my anthem when I devised my revenge on her I drew up the plans while listening to her debut album How can that mean nothing to her So I preyed upon a couple artists she rejected at a Lights Up audition okay you probably dont know what that is. Just say she humiliated these kids bigtime. Thats how I knew I had a pair of pawns on my hands. Next thing you know were hijacking concerts knocking all the EDM kings queens and nonbinary royalty off their thrones. We replaced it all with rock. It was glorious. Tatiana ate crow that day. And thenwell we can save the details for later but lets just say it all went wrong and I guess Im dead now. Land mine by the way. Tap tap. Did you actually know her Winston wrote. I went to twenty of her live concerts Kliff argued. Is that not knowing her It sounds like a parasocial relationship Winston wrote. You tried to kill people because she retired from making music. Yeah And Silence for a while. Then tapping. I think I was trying to help someone get revenge too Winston wrote. But for something different. I think someone killed or tried to kill my friend. Ouch Kliff replied. Id offer to do something about that but. Well. Were very dead. Winston had no response. Theyd by then reached a quiet back alley. Okay. Kliff leaned up against a wall one foot casually pressing the brick. Winston just stood in his usual uncomfortablelooking hunch his expression flat. It was creepy if Kliff was honest but he didnt want to make a creepy person whod threatened him mad. Lets hear what this audio file is. As promised there was only one BDB.mp3 Better be good Kliff said as he tapped the play button. What followed was not good. It was a cacophony with backup singers growling BOOM DA BOOM BOOM BOOM DA BOOM to introduce the strangest rap that either of the two men had ever heard. In the middle of the night in the middle of a dream Petes raspy voice proclaimed in rhythm. I was surrounded by water being carried downstream. The next thing I knew I was hangin with Alice in Wonderland. Mickey Mouse was the drummer of the band Kliffs expression became more and more horrified the longer it went on. Winstons face remained unchanged but internally he was reacting the same way Kliff was. When the song ended with a final spoken Bring it home the partners slowly raised their gazes to look at one another. Wehave to play this Kliff said slowly. At a live concert. Winston nodded. Then thought it over. Then shook his head. Tap tap and Kliffs phone read We cant play it. We have to get someone else to. No one can SEE us Kliff argued. How are we supposed to show them this sin against music Winston shrugged lightly. Kliff let out a long low sigh. All right. I guess our souls depend on it though this almost makes me consider the alternative and whether thats any less degrading. Tap tap. Winston wrote DONT FUCK THIS UP FOR ME. Just follow me. Kliff pushed off the wall to stride out of the alley. Ill do the legwork. This is my game after all. Winston let out a small sigh as he trailed after. It wasnt hard to find the Third District even without clear labeling. Beyond the tall doors one could hear the music thumping. Kliff and Winston entered to find an open arena all blues and purples with a portable stage set up next to a golden fountain. Five musicians comprised a band drummer guitar bass keyboard and vocals that played a jaunty power anthem. Now THIS is music Kliff said triumphantly striding into the crowd. Winston had to shuffle to not lose sight of him. When Kliff started moshing Winston tugged his scarf impatiently to remind him they had a job to do. Im WORKING on it Kliff argued. I do my best thinking when Im rockin out. Somehow Winston doubted there was any actual thinking going on beneath that fieryred hair. He folded his arms and gave an indignant huff. Kliff was dead to him now and they were probably both damned. There had to be something he could do. Why would they give him an impossible challenge The first one was beatable. Thanks to Kliffs quick thinking actually and Winston had to give him that credit at least. He wouldnt have been able to come up with that idea in time. How hilariously ironic would it be if Winston managed to solve a problem practically catered to Kliff Well he was already here at a concert that was far too loud and assaulting his senses. A few coughs escaped. No this was not his scene at all. He might as well try to drown it out with some deep thought about how to solve this puzzle. It hinged on getting a message across. Passing the song to one of the living. Of course no one in their right mind would want to actually play it but that was a problem for later. The linchpin was the communication. Hadnt their captor mentioned spaces where the living and dead could interact If he knew the mark he could find one of those spaces and wait it out. Of course that would involve tearing Kliff away from the crowd. Which should be reserved for a sure thing not a hunch of a plan. This music was too loud. Winston could barely stand it it was like he was about to explode from the inside out. Dignity cast aside and no one could see him anyway save the guy too busy rocking he collapsed to the ground pulling his knees to his chest and slamming his hands over his ears. He wore those dark glasses for a reason after all. But even that didnt drown out all the noise. No matter how he focused his thoughts the buzzing was there at the edges of his consciousness. A clash of discordant tunes that didnt seem to match anymore and wasnt the point of a song to sound coherent Wait. He wasnt hearing just the song on its own. When he blocked out everything else trying to actively fight the song he was getting snippets of something else. I hope they play I Write Sins Man Bit is hot Hachacha this concert is on fire Winston scrambled to his feet nearly stumbling and spilling over. He then tackled Kliff to get him to stop dancing. WHAT Kliff yelled. Winston released him long enough to grab his phone. Tap tap. I can read minds he wrote. I need to focus. Maybe you can too. Are you serious right now Kliff asked in disbelief. Winston slowly nodded. What did you DO Kliff asked. Tap tap. I FOCUSED. Not on the music. Tune everything out the message read. Kliff looked in disbelief from Winston to the phone and back. He shook his head. This is insane. Winston made a gesture of desperation raising his arms and clenching his fingers. Well it looked like Kliff wouldnt be getting out of this without giving it the old college try. He shut his eyes inhaled But he wasnt going to drown out the song. That was madness. Instead he let the song fill him every corner of his body and soul until he was as one with the music. And that was when he heard it I could go for an ice cream right now. Draco wouldve loved this. This is awesome kupo I wonder if Bit is single Kliffs eyes snapped open and the murmur ceased as the cheers of the crowd took back over. Holy He gaped at Winston. You werent lying. Winston clenched his brow and teeth alike. Okay sorry Kliff muttered. So thisis good. We can Winston didnt catch the rest of it because the noise surrounding them was far too loud. He just gave a slightly panicked look until Kliff yelled very unmistakably CAN. YOU. HEAR. ME Winston had to shake his head. Kliff gestured for Winston to follow they departed the entire district shutting the doors behind them as they entered the quieter First District. What I was saying is we can see if it works both ways Kliff explained. If we can hear them maybe they can hear us. We just need a good test subject. His eyes fixed on a redheaded woman wearing a white tunic and a red zipup corset. It was a little more difficult for Kliff to work with the music being so distant but he could still make out the beat and the bass and again he let it fill him using it as a catalyst. He was in her mind. She was thinking about oh and how rich this was how much she didnt like the band because it wasnt electronic enough. Kliffs response was kneejerk furious. He saw her flinch then realized he mustve transmitted something without even intending to. Then he saw her expression soften and she very clearly said to her nearby friend Actually rock isnt so bad. It kinda rules. A wicked smile overtook Kliff. Oh this is perfect he said smugly. I just changed her mind. Turns out it does go both ways. I think you know what we have to do now His face immediately fell. Andit starts with us memorizing that damn song. He felt a wiry hand pat his shoulder sympathetically. Back down the alley and Kliff and Winston were listening to Boom Da Boom again and again until Kliff could sing it by heart. Filled with regret that hed tainted his musicloving soul with such drivel Kliff looked to Winston You know it now Winston nodded. Okay Kliff said. Lets go plant some earworms. Dont go for the band right away. Start with the audience. Tap tap Trust me Kliff said before Winston could send the sentence. Itll work better this way. Back to the concert and Kliff maybe potentially almost felt bad for Winston having to go back into the cacophony. No time to dwell on that now of course. They had a mission to carry out. Kliff fixated on the music currently playing first. Winston shut it out as much as he could. The buzzing of the crowds minds crackled toward them effervescently and then they were connected. Ready to transmit. Fighting the beat of the song currently being played the two dead men projected the entirety of Boom Da Boom from the first horrible note to the abrupt ending into mind after mind. Then Kliff aimed his sights on the lead singer of the band a woman whose hair was lighter than her skin sweating profusely as evidenced by the skin showing beneath her black tank top. She danced about in brown cargo pants exuding a joyful energy. He could read from her mind that this was Bit and now he got why so many people were wondering if she was single. She was no Tatiana but also not unattractive. Slowly carefully Kliff injected the entirety of Boom Da Boom into her mind then did it again. Once he was finished he moved on to her twin brother Byte who was the drummer of the band much like Mickey Mouse a fact mentioned not once but twice in Petes magnum opus and fed him the same knowing Winston had the other three band members under control. There was method to Kliffs madness. When Bit first heard the song in her head while she was singing a completely different song no less she thought it some sort of hallucination. Maybe something from a dream. Whatever the case the song sounded horrible so she wasnt about to give it a second thought. She wrapped up her song with a stunning high note the keyboardist riffing scales up and down chaotically to accompany her. The crowd broke out into cheers screams and thunderous applause. WEVE GOT TIME FOR ONE MORE SONG Bit yelled out to the crowd. ANY REQUESTS Someone unable to ignore the nagging new inspiration in his head screamed out BOOM DA BOOM And someone else realizing that the first person knew the song that had gotten in their head shouted BOOM DA BOOM because now they wanted to hear it played since it was apparently a wellknown hit. Like a wave the mania washed over the crowd. BOOM DA BOOM they cheered. BOOM DA BOOM Bit looked to Byte in confusion. How do we know this song she asked. Musta heard it on the radio Byte replied. I dunno. But weve all heard it somewhere. I think I still remember it pretty clearly. Wanna do it We gotta give the people what they want Bit said. Even if the song iskinda horrible. Its campy Byte said with a grin. People love campy Bit turned back to the audience ARE YOU READY FOR SOME BOOM DA BOOM Everyone screamed in ecstasy. Byte smacked his drumsticks ONE TWO THREE FOUR As the band played her in Bit screamed into the microphone BOOM DA BOOM BOOMBOOM DA BOOM And actually the song sounded halfway decent coming from her. The crowd was sent into a frenzy cheering and dancing. Kliff felt pride bubble within him hed managed to sway them all. If only it had been for something he wanted rather than something he was being forced to do. His phone beeped. He read the message from Winston You were right about the crowd. Of course I was Kliff replied with a sly smirk toward Winston. Then caught up in the euphoria of having solved the challenge along with the rush of the live music he grabbed Winstons hand and pulled him along into a spinning dance. At first Winston was not amused at all. But within a few beats of the song he found he had a newfound energy as well and he let Kliff spin and dip him twirl and guide him. And for the first time since theyd met Kliff finally saw Winstons mouth curl up into a smile. But only for a moment. Bit threw a fist high into the air BRING IT HOME The crowd went wild and the song ended. Both phones were buzzing so Kliff wasted no time dragging Winston out of the loud crowd still clutching the scientists pale hand. Once they were in the quieter First District Kliff answered So how do you like THEM apples Congratulations Kieran replied. You successfully pulled off the Pete Revolution. I hope you know how much bad energy you put into the universe from that alone. But you finished the challenge in the nick of time. They hadnt even noticed their timers burning not until Kieran removed them. Kliff and Winston examined their bare palms then used them to mop their brows. The rest of the day is yours to do what you want Kieran said. But when the phone rings youd better answer. The connection broke. Well. Kliff shrugged. Looks like we get to do whatever now. But if were going to stay here longterm wed better find a place to crash. Winston nodded. Kliff really wasnt picky after all hed spent a long stint of time sleeping in a makeshift apartment in the sewers beneath Vinyl City. However he was curious about the marked areas that Kieran had mentioned earlier. I wanna see if we can find some of those places just for us he said. Not the shops though. Whaddaya say we walk the perimeter Winston nodded. They set out Kliff in the lead. While we walk he said tell me. How exactly does one make a cyborg Its not pretty Winston wrote. I can handle it Kliff insisted. Itll make the walk less boring. After Winston had gotten into the nittygritty of the mechanization process Kliff ended up rushing for a public garbage can in order to hurl the contents of his stomach. Why was there even anything in there He was a dead soul. More research needed. This ended up being a good thing however because when he looked up he saw the symbol throbbing with light over a door. A twisted and dark tangle of thorny lines. Winston Kliff called over. Think I just found something. As Winston caught up Kliff tried the door. Unlocked. In they stepped. It was a small quaint home with cutesy decorations. One bedroom one bathroom a small kitchen. The kitchen table which served as the dining table had a placard folded over it red text on black. Kliff picked it up to read it aloud Congratulations Youve found a Reapers Hideaway. Enjoy your stay Mortals cant enter which means no one can save you He scoffed putting the card back down. Getting tired of these people. Winston had begun to rifle through the cabinets and Kliff remembered that hed just been wondering if food was necessary for them. Whether or not it was he could sure use something to replace what hed deposited in the garbage can so he got up to help. The two of them ended up pooling their combined cooking knowledge to create a feast of cereal with milk and orange slices eaten directly out of the can. Ive been thinking Kliff said. Winston gave him a dry look. I know you want to say Im surprised you can or Thats dangerous for you or something like that Kliff accused. Winston hung his head. Reached for his phone. Wrote Actually you had at least two moments of brilliance today. We make a pretty good team Kliff replied. After all you were the one who figured out how to hack the minds of the crowd Which is what leads me to wonder. Youre a genius who can turn men into machines. I bend crowds to my will Ive caused an outright revolution. You and me we dont deserve to be trapped in this game. What we SHOULD be doing is using our powers to wreak havoc and take what we want in this town game or no game. Winston nodded his assent. I say we use our down time to figure out exactly whos in charge of us Kliff went on and how we can mutiny. Another nod from Winston. So youre with me Winston held up his right hand and Kliff understood. They were bonded as partners. And now they were actually both rather happy about that fact. Good Kliff said. Operation Rock Revolution II begins tomorrow. They retired to the single bedroom. No clothes to change into so they agreed to just sleep in their daywear and figure out alternate wardrobes in their next stint of down time. Neither of them made a fuss about sharing they were both adults after all and there was nothing to fuss about. Winston set aside his dark glasses then flopped onto the mattress falling asleep as soon as he touched it. That was another thing Kliff found odd the fact that dead souls could sleep and seemed to need it too. He paused a moment. Seeing Winston like this was an utter novelty. No glasses no coughing no standing eerily still for moments at a time no hunched stance. His facial expression was nowhere near the smile from the dance but it was serene at least. In this state he almost looked pretty. No Tatiana of course. Kliff shrugged it off setting aside his scarf and his own spectacles. Tomorrow was a new day. And his mind was already buzzing with ideas of how to trace the system all the way to the top and once at the summit wrest the power back. When his head hit the pillow he fell stone asleep. Pete chuckled The plan went off without a single hitch Now not only am I the hottest singer in Traverse Town but we got livin proof the guys a real natural at swayin the crowd Not to mention the other one Kieran added. Im still waiting for him to go feral on someone but in the meantime its fun watching him be the brains of the operation. Hey Claude Pete called back. We need to get this party heated up Got us a new pair of sinners on deck Patience Frollo cautioned he stood before an illusion projection that swapped between vistas on a hundred different worlds at his view. Those suitable enough for the delivery of justice do not always come in obvious pairs. We are not looking for the common rabble after all. You can always bring in an odd number Kieran said. The partner situation will sort itself out. How Pete asked. Kieran grinned. It always does. Pins had been returned to players. That meant a rebirth of a particular subset of the Dark that summoned when souls received the black pins that allowed them entry to the Reapers Game. From the shadows they rose and flowed. Not Heartless not Nobodies or Unversed or Nightmares but something of the same ilk. They were wiry in construction their bodies fragilelooking skeletal. Their colors bright. Eyes all bright red. Bipedal bears slippery frogs oversized bats. The living could not see them. They could however feel the effects of the creatures presence. All of Traverse Town became just a little bit darker.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/39907413,Excavating Midnight,After photographing the island from the air Aurora steered the glyph down aiming for a stretch of beach as pale as bone.Her eyes flickered toward the half of the landmass shrouded in darkness but instead she landed on the slightly sunnier shore and clambered overboard. Here she said to no one in particular to the twilight air of the twentysixth island that had surged from the sea just days before.Tucking her camera into her pack Aurora adjusted her baggy shirt and breeches and made her way up the beach. Her boots sank into the sand impractical here but theyd come in handy once she reached the forest ahead. Seagulls reeled against the darkening sky and salt ghosted in from the sea like a painful memory that still stung. Feeling her braid unravel she let her pack thud to the ground the pickaxe inside clunking her foot. She replaited her long blond hair pressed her hands into the small of her back and watched a gull dive for some crustacean with claws as red as eyerims.The forest beckoned beyond the beach the thick trunks and the leaves so dense as dense as the crowds on the Yebba Dim Day that she wondered if any sunlight leaked through at all. And at the thought her heart soared. Who knew what she might find in there what mysteries what wonders Maybe something to finally make her family take her interests seriously. She knew they only indulged her fascination with ancient sites so long as they didnt interfere with her royal duties as the Princess of Day that they still doted on her like a child even though she was twentyone that they didnt see her as a real archaeologist even though shed loved the artifacts on Orlandos Cap since she was old enough to ferry over alone.Well if her discoveries made their way into Klepps Almenak her family would have to sit up and take notice then. So would the rest of the Abarat. Maybe in this forest shed find the skeleton of a temple like those scattered over Gnomon. Or maybe shed clear away the foliage from the levels of a ziggurat like the Great Noahic Ziggurat on Soma Plume. Or maybe shed even stumble on the remains of an entire city like those covered in ash from Mount Galigali on Scoriae.Whatever her discovery she didnt have long to make it. Expeditions would be quick to storm the island. Not only was it brand new but this forest and beach sitting here as if theyd never been under the ocean as if theyd been whisked to the Abarat from a different dimension reeked of some magic some enchantment. Right now she had only the slim advantage of working alone unencumbered by the bureaucratic morass slowing down the professional teams.Hauling her pack over her shoulder Aurora continued her slog up the beach sweat already beading her hairline. Before long the trees enveloped her and she turned and caught one last glimpse of waves breaking on the shore like flares of insight before the ocean vanished. Tugging out the compass she wore on a leather cord round her neck she checked her orientationwestward bound toward Night. The new island had surfaced between Scoriae and the Yebba Dim Day between the boundaries of Day and Night and soon those kingdoms would begin arguing over who would claim ownership. As the Princess of Day she knew she had to restrict herself to the sunlit regions but this didnt stop her from wondering what was on the other side of twilight beyond the reach of the light.There was still plenty for her to explore however. And after what felt like hours of ducking under branches and jumping over brooks and navigating through ravines in a clearing she stepped on something that clacked beneath her boot.Aurora looked down and couldnt stop a cry of delight from escaping her lips. Flattened stones a cluster of them under her. One two three fourwhat was the archaeological maxim One stone is a stone two stones are a feature three stones are a wall and four stones are a palace. These could be the top of some ancient fortress some ancient city buried underground. And she was the first to discover it.Sweeping the ground with her gaze she scanned for more stones pottery shards. Didnt see any but this meant nothing. The whole area would need a reconnaissance survey would need workers walking the transects and searching for artifacts. Already she could see the horizontal excavation in her mind could see the five meter by five meter holes dug into the earth could feel the trowel beneath her hands as she combed through dirt. And the dirt itself hauled off in black buckets and animal bones in green buckets and the pottery shed undoubtedly find in orange bucketsthe color schemes shed read archaeologists used to sort through a site.Kneeling down she shrugged off her pack and fished out one of her brushes. She bent over and began clearing away some of the leaves on top of the stones clouds of insects humming around her bird songs shed never heard before ringing in her ears. There the stones were fully exposed now and she stood pulled a marker from her pack and planted it in the earth before snapping a photo.Reaching for her compass she glanced down to check her bearings. Frowned. The needle was spinning wildly as often happened to compasses close to the TwentyFifth Hour. But she was nowhere near that islandwas her compass broken She gave it a shake reexamined its face. No there was the needle still spinning.Her gaze flew around the trees looming in every direction beyond the clearing and for the first time she felt a flicker of unease. How would she find her way back to her glyph She couldnt even hear the gulls anymorethe screeches of inland birds had replaced their cries. Drawing a deep breath she gripped the compass more tightly and tried to calm her thoughts. She had markers a whole pack of them. If worse came to worst shed pick a route and head as straight as she could. This was an island after all and eventually shed hit the ocean. Then shed walk along the beach until she found her glyph it couldnt be far and then shed have a way back to this site wouldnt she when she returned with reinforcements so there was no reason to panicCompasses dont work a deep voice said.Gasping she whirled around to find a man towering mere feet away. And now she barely stifled a scream because he was all muscles and brawn except for his skeletal head which looked more dead than alive. He wore dark robes and a glass collar filled with liquid his head submerged to his nose what appeared to be emaciated worms slithering around his neck and jaw. Above the collar his blue eyes were jarring.She stumbled back a step. She knew him from official reports from whispers around the Abarat. Christopher Carrion the Lord of Midnight. And here he was on the Day side of the island staring at her. At her the Princess of Day. How had he gotten so close without her hearing him Why was heCompasses dont work he repeated a smile twisting his scarred lipsshed heard about those too but why they were scarred no one seemed to knowyet something brought you here to me.She felt her mouth open and close. Summoned to struggle her voice. I am the Princess of Day I am . . . The words wouldnt come. He wouldnt hurt her would he Did he know who she was Somehow she didnt think so. She had to speak had to speak had toHer feet scrabbled over the stones and she heard herself gasping for air.The Lord of Midnight raised his hands to his collar each selecting a separate worm his smile now undoubtedly cruel. The creatures coiled around his wrists as he walked slowly towards her. Here is a list of fearful things he chanted his blue eyes glittering and she recognized the start of Righteous Bandys poem. The jaws of sharks a vultures wings the rabid bite of the dogs of war the voice of one who went before.He stopped held the worms a foot away from her their wriggling bodies giving off a nauseatingly yellow glow. A skeleton a skeleton wasThey dont look like much do they he said softly. But when these things are coiled in my brain they show me such delicious horrors. He was going to hurt her her he was going to kill her he was going toSo every now and then I reward them with a nice fat meal of fear. That same glow was in his eyes too horrible horrible.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/47642719,Sons of the Abbey - A Touch of Grace,There was a big party planned at the Herb of Grace the beloved home of General George Eliots family on the Hampshire coast. The oldest son Ben Eliot was about to celebrate his birthday. For his close relatives this was a source of joy but for Ben who hated to be the centre of attention at the best of times it was an irksome duty to appear to take pleasure in the preparations of the party that his mother Nadine sister Caroline and his cousins wife Sally had insisted be held at the Herb of Grace. I would far rather have gone somewhere quietly with you Ben said to his unofficial fianc√©e Heloise the young Frenchwoman who although older and far more experienced than himself he often thought humbly had deigned to smile on him and his shy advances. He hoped that they could marry soon but presently with no income to speak of and Heloise still the livein governess to his cousin Davids three young children there wasnt much hope of his being able to support her or even contribute equally to their income. They were sitting at their special place in Knyghtwood the old oak forest near Bens home a fifteenth century inn that used to be attached to the Cistercian monastery nearby near the Hard. Heloise put her hand on his knee caressingly. Your family as been so kind to me I like it that they want to celebrate with you. You ave to be generous sometimes Ben. So he had grudgingly gone along with the idea but felt a little remote from it all. He said as much daringly to his mother. Why dont you invite some friends darling suggested Nadine touching his cheek with a finger. Weve never met any of your friends living down here. Perhaps he said noncommittally. I havent seen much of any of them.Ben blanched at the thought unsure if it would redeem the event for him. Living down here on the Hampshire coast for the last three years he had hardly kept in contact with any of the fellows he had known at school and made only a few new acquaintances. Perhaps if he had joined the Foreign Office as his parents had wished he might have made some new friends. But the idea grew on him and faces and names came to mind. Funnily enough they were mostly a little older than he. These boys had taken him kindly under their wings offering the protection of a strong friendship group born out of the presence of their younger brothers and cousins at school. It had seemed natural somehow to Ben that he gravitated to this circle of selfcontained boys who were never embarrassed to play with their younger brothers or older for that matter.The chief of these was John Raymond who was the elder boy of a large family which lived down in Sussex. His friends the Marchwood brothers Andrew and Tony from Buckinghamshire had an even larger family with so many younger brothers and sisters that Ben had lost count. Their neighbour Richard Everett had completed just his final year at the same school and they always travelled together. Giles Marlows family was not quite as large as the Marchwood crowd so Ben understood but between he and his brother it was all girls. There were two Scottish boys Fraser Major and Minor as well who had mysteriously lived on Samoa before they came to school. Roderick Kane always called Roddy had spent a year or two with them at school before going to Dartmouth. He had a Countess for a sister and actually lived in a castle not that far away in Sussex. The castle had been requisitioned during the war and the earl the countess and their family had spent the war at another castle in Scotland. Roddys cousin his sisters husband the earl had died and now oddly his much younger nephew had the title.It was a long time before Ben and Roddy had seen each other again after Kane left the school but they had met by accident at the Lords test match a couple of years ago and had quite a good time. They had both gone to see the batting of the legendary Don Bradman. Older than all of them but revered by all for his sporting prowess and tales of holiday adventure was Walker Minor. His older brother had left before any of them started but was now captain of his own ship. Marlow and Kane had met Captain John Walker since the war and spoke in awe of him as a fair and capable commander. The younger brother Roger who had been a pilot during the last years of the war had kept an eye on the youngsters from the south who were all so close in age and temperament.Ben knew he couldnt invite all of them so after much thought he decided to limit his invitations to John Raymond Tony Marchwood and Roddy Kane. Roddy was exactly his age Tony only two years older and John two years older again. They had all been in the same house at school. Raymond was really the one Ben had liked most to spend time with and he wanted to see him again. Raymond was the only one who had been interested in his art even then and encouraged him to keep drawing. His father was a photographer. Maybe that was why he was sympathetic. As far as Ben knew none of them was married. Should he invite them to bring someone But that would mean smart girls that Ben didnt know and he didnt like at all the idea of having to make conversation with even more people than necessary. He consulted his mother Nadine on the issue.Darling we cant really accommodate young single women in addition to your young male friends said Nadine patiently having struggled all day thinking how to manage her guests at the Herb of Grace as well as plan the party. Of course she wanted the party for Ben but it didnt need to be the threering circus that Sally and Caroline seemed to think necessary. Perhaps for Tommys party . Nadine had to pull herself up short. Everyone knew Tommy was her favourite but she tried and mostly succeeded to treat her children even handedly these days. Even Caroline who had always dismayed and confused her seemed to be easier to talk to now. She made more sense to Nadine as a houseproud young woman than as an anxious little girl.If they were married couples it might be possible but the parents of most well brought up young women still dont expect them to share bedrooms with their companions at a party. And I cant ask them all to share a room. I hope you dont mind. Nadine felt anxious. It was so unusual that this oldest child of hers expressed a wish for anything. But he had become a little more assertive lately now that he had refused to join the Foreign Office and had taken up art in earnest. That wretched John Adair. She suspected that foreign fellow Sebastian Weber had had a hand in the decision as well. At least she no longer had to contend with him.No no said Ben hastily worried that Nadine might actually think he wanted these unknown girls to attend. Im sure they wont expect to bring a friend to a weekend house party these days. Ben wrote his invitations and sent them away torn between hoping that they would all come or none. His siblings showed no interest in his choice of invited friends which didnt really surprise him. Tommy of course was interested in noone but himself Ben sometimes thought. Tommy knew Roddy and Tony slightly but Ben knew that unless they were doctors in training they most likely would have nothing in common with his younger brother. Caroline thought day and night of recipes it seemed to him and the twins were still an autonomous kind of single mysterious entity. He knew he could rely on them all to be polite to his guests when they actually arrived but would have liked a little more curiosity given that he had never invited his own friends home before. David alone of them all expressed some interest when Ben mentioned the name Marchwood. He spoke briefly about a wartime visit to Buckinghamshire a fine old Abbey and meeting some of the Marchwood family. But when Ben referred to John Raymond David looked unaccountably startled and almost pleased. Ben puzzled over that for a while but wasnt going to ask why. David was always hard to fathom.,General Audiences,Not Found
https://archiveofourown.org/works/30907322,The Abbey Girls in Scotland,Mary have you ever been to Scotland asked Rosamund Kane Lady Kentisbury as she packed for her return to the castle at Vairy. She and her children had been evacuated there earlier in the war. Mary Devine known to her friends at the Hall as MaryDorothy was secretary to Lady Joy Quellyn a writer of books and confidante of all the Hall residents former and present. No said Mary not that I recall. Perhaps there was a childhood holiday but certainly never since my parents died. I feel bad about that exclaimed Rosamund. We should have offered you a holiday at Vairy long before this. Im not sure you ever stayed with us at Kentisbury either. I do apologise for that oversight. Oh my goodness Rosamund please dont apologise remonstrated Mary. You know I always want to be here at the Hall to help Joy and besides its my home I never looked for holidays for living here has been like one continuous holiday ever since Joy asked me to move here from London. And I have been to the Grange occasionally and visited the Castle with the twins quite a few times. And remember when you and I travelled to Switzerland together That was such an adventure for me. Its nice of you to feel that way Mary said Rosamund but I would love for you to have an experience of my home as well and a little break to look back on when you are back at the Hall. Why it might inspire a new book too. Dont authors always find inspiration in new places like composers and artists I believe thats true said Mary although I seem to find endless inspiration in the quiet places around here. And the not so quiet She finished with a laugh as a seeming cascade of Joy and Ivor Quellyns children ran chattering up the stairs. Mary would you come to Vairy with Janice and I tomorrow I know its short notice suggested Rosamund. Its partly selfinterest I have to confess. Jandy is bringing John and her two little girls and it would be a great help if you came with us. I have such a crowd at the Castle so your help would be really appreciated. But we would make sure you had plenty of time to yourself to enjoy the district as well. Its very tempting Ros said Mary well aware that Rosamunds nursery was amply provided with capable nurses for her family and that this gentle appeal was to convince her she was needed. Do you mind if I discuss it with Joy first I wouldnt want to leave her in the lurch. Joy was very encouraging of Mary taking a holiday in the north. You have worked tirelessly on my behalf for such a long time Mary. Im so grateful to Rosamund for suggesting that you go with her. Mary retired to her room to pack and gazed out at the view of the garden from her window wondering how long it would be before she could return. Travel was always at the mercy of change due to wartime requirements or delays. As her eyes rested on the darkening shapes of the Abbey a thought occurred to her. Joy she said after supper that evening while the younger children David Richard and MaidieRose played with Cecily Rose and Janet Joy on their final night together. Ive been thinking about Benedicta. Now that she is Abbey Guardian since the twins are away so often do you think she might like to stay in my rooms while I am away It would give her company I am rather worried she is so often alone these days. Would you be happy with that arrangement I can certainly suggest it to her Mary said Joy. Its kind of you to offer her your own rooms. Id enjoy her company too since as you say the twins and Ivor are away so often and now I am losing you and Jandy too What will I do without you Mary Should I stay Joy said Mary immediately. I dont want you to be without help or company. Mary could scarcely believe that Joy might actually miss her. Of course not said Joy hastily realizing her words had made Mary regret her acceptance of the invitation. Ivor and I will enjoy managing together and Jen is just down the lane if I need more company But it will be lovely to have Benedicta as a companion for a while. I can never forget that she saved Margarets life all those years ago. And she has been a lonely person for some time. Perhaps we might do each other some good.,General Audiences,Not Found
https://archiveofourown.org/works/29930226,The Abbey Girls At War,Ambrose sat for a time each night in the silent space that had been the great church of Grace Dieu Abbey. Nigh on seventy years ago the soldiers had come with their crowbars and axes the plundering villagers with their ladders swarming over the roof to pull away all the lead they could find. There were no walls now around the cruciform shape of the great church and the rising wind seemed the echo of a chant. All of the roof had fallen and the beautiful flooring was covered deep with leaves and silt then more leaves and silt and sometimes even snow. Not for anything would he sweep away that blessed covering. The very stones were still being stolen for walls and buildings. By and by there would be almost nothing to mark that the church had been there at all but for the artists drawing that hung now at the Manor. He was the last. Some of the lay brothers had taken employment with nearby farmers but most were dead and the monks all twentyfour of them were gone to France by the dubious grace of Henry VIII to seek refuge among their brethren. Some he had seen again when he roamed that land but that was sixty years ago. There would be none left now. Only he and the souls of those who slept beneath the cloister garth or deep below in the secret chamber where the tomb of Abbot Michael lay forgotten were witness now to the small lingering gentle signs of wild life within the Abbey the birds the flowers the grass and herbs and fish. Squirrels foxes cats a badger once. Soon the Abbey would be known and loved by no living soul. Had the great comet foretold the destruction that surely came The monks had watched the great long star the sign of the Lord for ten nights that August of 1531 fearful of its portent. Many had begun to plan to leave even then after seeing it from high on the hills at the top of the Monks Path. He had then been but a fifteenyearold boy fresh from France an apprentice goldsmith come to ply his craft. The gentry who had bought the Abbey as an accessory to their new manor house the Abingers had no love for it for they were Protestants. Old Farmer Edwards had use of the buildings now. At least most of them were still standing. That was something to be thankful for. Ambrose thought with some small satisfaction of the few things he hidden before the soldiers and new owner came. Sacred things the manuscripts deep in the crypt and vestments dropped into the holes where new trees were planted late at night. He had worked long with beeswax to make the cloth proof against water so that the Abbots burse and vestments should lie safely. He had twisted the dried leaves of the flag iris to make a strong cord and tied the package tight. He and some of his brothers had carted the great bell laboriously to the barn and hauled her by block and tackle onto the oak floor held by strong rafters where God willing she would be found by kinder hands one day. The other bell buried deep below a hillside was hidden from eyes that would see wealth only in her metal. Let her sleep. The farmers small animals and little creatures of the night were grateful for the new drinking bowl but never noticed the carvings of serpents that wound around it. Ambrose smiled to see their trust. Maybe one day some curious child of the farm would guess its true purpose and just possibly restore it to a new church. Jehanes blessed memory was not to be sullied by unkind or vicious hands her legacy buried deep in the crypt. He had told her story as best he could. The plate and serving vessels from the altar objects almost too sacred for him to touch he had reverently placed in that same hiding place where if they were never found at least desecration had not been wrought on them. His work for the Abbey was done. Now his work was to keep soul and body together until that final day when he would go to meet the Lord and perhaps be vouchsafed a glimpse of the angel Jehane. Just a glimpse would be enough for eternity for she was already in his heart. Until then he had his small ones for company his garden and the kindly family of the Manor who would let him till a little ground and raise a few white chickens. The fish stream would still give him food and the herbs that were now going wild in the old herb garden outside the gatehouse could still sweeten a brace of rabbits from a generous hunter. He would finish his diary. There was no other place or work for him now. Sometimes his Peregrine with his little bride the Lady Katharine gentle daughter of the Manor would walk through the quiet groves of the Abbey grounds her white veils blowing in the light breeze. Early this year she and her maids came dancing to the gatehouse garden gathering flowers for their garlands on Maie Day. The French names came more easily to him now jonquilles campanule narcisse girofl√©e maie lavande violettes bluets and capucins pens√©es yellow primev√©re and gold soucis. The gay little bouton dor and the herbe aux gueux. He twisted wreaths of honeysuckle vine to fit their pretty heads with hands that had once worked gold. The maids wove the flowers through to make the garlands then wore them proudly laughing. Wearing their festive headgear they sang and danced upon the garth. A sacrilege true but one he thought the Lord would pardon now that none worked or worshipped there. Surely the Lord loved music too. Sometimes at night a white owl would swoop silently through the air below the canopy of stars. Betimes he thought he saw a figure walking through the gatehouse garden white veils flowing. Or was it a trick of the mist And sometimes he would hear the laughter of children as they seemed to dance to a tune played on a little pipe by some minstrel. A singers voice once carolled a tune he knew not through the quiet space the old story of the fox and grapes. Was he dreaming The waking days were slow and held pain. Sleep and dreams were very sweet.,General Audiences,Not Found
https://archiveofourown.org/works/27972263,The Garnet Links,Joan Fraser with her husband Lennox known as Len and their baby John had finally settled in the Herb Garden their new home nestled in a quiet corner of the Grace Dieu Abbey grounds. Joan Raymond who had inherited the Abbey on the death of her cousin Joys grandfather Sir Antony Abinger had agreed to the younger Joans request to sell part of the grounds to them so they could build their house. Each Joan felt closer to the Abbey than to any other place on Earth. Joans mother Janice Fraser had helped to furnish the house while Joan and her very young baby had travelled to Sydney where her husband was recovering after a serious accident in the Antarctic. Len Frasers injuries had been severe and it would be many months perhaps before he could walk unaided. Their house was very convenient for him and an experienced male nurse had been engaged to help for several months. Janice was staying with them for the first few weeks until her husband Alec arrived to take up retirement on the south coast. Im so glad Mother was able to be here over the last few months said Joan to Jen Marchwood who lived next door in Marchwood Manor as they sat in the front room of Joans new home. Yes agreed Jen Janice being here for Johns birth and when we heard about Len was so fortunate. Jandy couldnt miss the arrival of her first grandchild Even though it meant coming all the way from Ceylon she added cuddling the cause of that great voyage. Janice Joans mother had brought her two youngest children with her to meet their nephew and had been present when the terrible news of her soninlaws accident had broken. Presently Janice was out paying a visit to Maidlin Robertson and her twin girls and little boys. I dont know how I would have managed without her and I still feel like that admitted Joan. I dont know much about how to care for little John she said. Thank goodness you built the house with plenty of bedrooms said Jen. Janice was occupying one of these while her little daughters Cecily Rose and Janet Joy were being entertained at Kentisbury Castle. Rosamund the Countess of Kentisbury had a suite of nursemaids for her own large family. When Joan was ready Janice would relocate to Rayley the home of her first Abbey friend Joan Raymond and claim her daughters from Rosamunds nursery. Janices two boys Alastair and Alan were in their final years of school in Yorkshire. With Alec due to arrive soon on his ship the whole family might be reunited for the first time in many years. They were hoping to build or buy a house to retire to. Ive brought you a housewarming present from Simon Patrick Littlejan said Jen. You know how much I love Farnham pottery I am always glad when someone gives me an excuse to get some more With a cry of delight Joan unpacked the box that Jen had brought. In it were three jugs in different sizes each baked with a warm golden glaze and shaped like a squat owl. Oh they are beautiful Jen thank you so much Father Owl Mother Owl and Baby Owl laughed Jen. I know you have had housewarming gifts from all the rest of the family so Simon couldnt miss out. He is particularly fond of owls. All of the friends from the Manor the Hall the Castle and the Pallant had given housewarming presents to Joan and Len in a muchloved tradition established when Rosamund had first moved into the Rose Cottage so long ago. Blankets towels crockery and cutlery napery and vases had all been gifted by their loving friends. After all as Joan was wont to say none of you knew about our wedding so we got no wedding presents at all Their house had been built in the Arts and Crafts style with small paned windows wide eaves and sloping roofs. There was an upper storey whose front window had a small balcony. The warm brick colour of the house with its archway over the recessed front door echoed the nearby Abbey gatehouse. At the southfacing rear of the house was a wide bricked courtyard covered with a trellis that would grow vines to shade in summer. Already the courtyard was surrounded by shrubs and flowers for planting had begun as soon as building. Benedicta Bennett the Abbey gardener had managed to salvage many of the original old rambling plants which had alerted her to the plots first use as the monks herb garden for their dispensary. She had also consulted a friend Daphne Gilmour who managed a large herb garden in Scotland and sold to several dispensaries about how best to cultivate and manage the herbs and which would grow best. There was a chance that Joan might be able to grow enough of certain herbs in the rich soil to become a supplier. But for now there was pleasure in simply living in the house and getting to know their favourite places for each time of day. Since Len was still unable to move independently much of Joans time was spent entertaining him as well as adoring little John. Tell me stories Littlejan Len begged one quiet afternoon using the pet name that Joans father had given her since she so resembled her mother Janice. Tell me more about your connection to this place and these people. There seem to be so many ways that you are part of this place. Joan patted the sleeping John and wondered where best to start. Her mother had been the first to visit here. It makes sense to start with Mothers story she said slowly. She can tell you more than I but some of it is hard for her to talk about. I dont know that I went that far back in my stories to you before. I was so busy telling you about my friends and the Hamlet Club that I didnt tell you much about the past. When I went to live in Ceylon with Mother began Joan she told me the whole story. Granny Janet and her two sisters went to live in Australia and she met my grandfather there. How did the three sisters come to be in Australia said Len. Did their whole family emigrate No replied Joan patting little John as he stirred in his basket. Their parents stayed in Scotland and their brothers and two more sisters Perhaps the three girls went out to take up work or to look for husbands Or maybe the family was too large for them all to manage at home. Many Scots left for Canada and Australia in the 1800s. I think some of my family left too. I know there are some on Prince Edward Island in Canada said Len. Did your mother know much about her father No Joan said sadly he died just before Mother was born. I think he contracted typhoid. His name was John Macdonald and he came from the same district in Scotland as my grandmother near Vairy Castle. Joan smiled at her husband so easily might she have been a young widow raising a firstborn child on her own. For a while it had been feared that like her grandfather Len might never see his own child. Vairy said Len. The Earls castle where we had our honeymoon Yes thats the one said Joan. Fancy we were there but didnt explore the family connection. Well it was our honeymoon said Len and I was leaving after two weeks for two years True laughed Joan. But now comes the part that links us to the Abbey. Joy Lady Quellyn had one uncle Tony Abinger said Joan resuming the tale. He met my Granny Janet in Australia about a year after grandfather had died. He asked her to marry him. Sadly poor Granny died a week before the wedding leaving Mother an orphan when she was only two. Tony Abinger her Uncle Tony stayed a loving presence in her life while she was growing up. After Granny died Mothers two aunts in Australia the Misses Fraser raised Mother in Sydney. Aunty Mary Fraser came back to England when Mother married and went to live in Scotland. What happened to Tony Abinger asked Len after a few moments where both had fallen silent and their hands had sought each other. His own luck in evading death and being with his wife and child were constant sources of thankfulness despite the pain he still suffered. This particular story was new to him and he reflected on the happy nature of his motherinlaw given the sadness of her earliest days. Tony Abinger died of illness at sea said Joan. I think it was some time prior to his fathers passing so he didnt inherit the property or the title. They had a serious argument which was why he left England. Uncle Tonys will named Mother as the recipient of his estate. But for a tragic accident the whole of the Abbey and Abinger Hall might have belonged to Mother. You mean all this beautiful place said Len in surprise. Yes said Littlejan. Mother had weeks of misery when she first met Joy and Joan Shirley now Lady Quellyn and Mrs Raymond of course. The lawyers had brought news about a sailor who claimed that Tony Abinger had died much later than first believed and that this sailor had looked after him. He had Uncle Tonys ring If the later date was true and he had died after his father Uncle Tony would have inherited the baronetcy and also the property instead of Joy. And he had left everything he owned to Mother. I suppose then Len said perceptively that these Abbey people feel a sense of rightness in Janices daughter living near Tony Abingers old home. After all it might all have been your home in truth. Oh I dont know said Joan humbly. Mother never wanted to take the property from Joy and Joan. She told me she would have given it back when she turned twentyone. And I think Mothers Uncle Tony never knew that his sister Joyce had a little girl. He wouldnt have meant the property to go away from the family unless there was noone left but Mother. Joyce was that Lady Quellyns mother said Len. Yes said Joan. But Joans mother brought them both up. Mrs Shirley and Joyce Abinger had married twins the Shirley brothers its from them they get their beautiful bronze hair,General Audiences,Not Found
https://archiveofourown.org/works/75096,Michelle of Min-y-Mor,Nell Masterman hurried home through the darkening London streets. Her brother would probably be waiting for her by this time for they were expected for dinner at the home of a great friend of his. But Nell worked in an office and a new piece of work had been given to her at the end of the afternoon and she had needed to stay later than usual to sort out what she would need to do the next day. She was a conscientious girl she and her brother shared a London flat and she kept house for him as well as keeping up her office job. She was a Guide her brother was a Scoutmaster and when they werent camping with their charges brother and sister would go tramping about the countryside on weekends or when they could get leave from their work. Nell also did country dancing when she had time her Guides loved learning the dances she taught them and she loved the energy of the dancing and the lilting beauty of the music. So it was a healthy pinkcheeked Nell who ran up the stairs to greet her brother.Youve just time for some tea he said. Ive thrown together a pot its all laid out he added.Good man exclaimed Nell. Im simply aching for tea.Why are you so lateNell poured herself a cup of tea and sat down in her fireside chair with a sigh. People will leave important work until the very last minute and they forget that their part of it isnt all there is. So I shall be spending all day tomorrow going over other peoples bookkeeping trying to find the details that I need to know to finish a report that a third person has written. Honestly Charlie its a wonder I have any hair left at allCharles Masterman looked at his sisters thick curls and chuckled. Oh youve plenty left as far as I can see. Anyway forget about work and get ready to enjoy tonight. Mike and Maribel are always good fun. And if I know you girls youll go off together to worship little Marilyn Rose.MariRose will be quite six months old by now said Nell. Youre right Im simply longing to see Baby. And Bels such good fun. I want her advice about my girls too.Problems with the Company Youve not mentioned anything.Oh its nothing to trouble you with. But Bel must have come across it in her long history as a Lieutenant. Besides Im sure that given half a chance you and Mike will go off planning this summers Jamboree and what are Bel and I supposed to do then Maribel may be a wife and proud mother and I may keep house for you and keep that office of mine from falling apart at the seams but were still Guides and we dont like being left outWill you girls be reminding us of Crystal Palace forever exclaimed Charlie for this was familiar banter between the two of them.Quite likely returned Nell. Clear the table will you Charlie Im going to change my frock then Ill dash through the washing up before we leave.Rightoh replied Charlie who was well aware of the work his sister did to make their flat comfortable and after he had cleared the table and put away the various crocks he put his scout training to use and happily turned to washing the dishes. When Nell returned to the kitchen had only to wipe the dishes and put them away before brother and sister were ready for their evening out.Maribel Marchwood greeted them at the door to the Marchwoods comfortable townhouse. She kissed Nell in greeting and waited for Charlie to finish paying the taxi driver before leading them through the door and taking their wraps. Quite the accomplished hostess said Nell.Given Mikes side of the family do you expect anything less retorted Maribel. Her husband Michael was first cousin to a baronet with a manor house in Oxfordshire and Maribels circle of friends and relations stretched all the way to the Earl and Countess of Kentisbury. Now do you want to see the nursery first Nell I know Mike wants to talk Jamboree with Charlie. If we give them a chance to get it all out of his sytem at the beginning of the evening we may be able to get some sensible conversation out of them later on.Slander exclaimed Mike Marchwood standing at the door of the drawing room. Never mind my wife Charlie we both know theres no conversation so sensible as planning camps for our boys.Ive already had Nell reminding me of Crystal Palace said Charlie.Good form Nell said Maribel. Come see the newest generation of Girl Guides she said and bore Nell off in the direction of the nursery leaving Charlie and Mike grinning at the foot of the stairs.Nell cooed appreciatively over Maribels newest daughter. Marilyn Rose was six months old fairhaired and placid and used to being adored by her mothers friends. Maribels older daughter was ready for bed and so Nell stayed with Maribel while she bathed and dressed little Marigold and put her to bed.MariRose is growing so fast said Nell in wonderment.They do that said Maribel from the vantage point of a proud mamma of two. No wishes for a baby or two of your own yet NellNo fear. Id have to find a man I could leave Charlie for and you havent seen Charlies puppydog eyes when he starts thinking of life without his housekeeper.Hes a Scout he can manage said Maribel firmly. Anyone on the horizon for himJust his fairy princess said Nell.A fairy princess Whatever do you meanElsa of Brabant. Oh Maribel Im not mad Nell exclaimed as Maribel looked at her incredulously. Her name is Elsa Dale she ran a ferry down in the Sandylands Charlie takes credit for the ferry actually. You really ought to ask him the story although then hell know that I told you about Elsa. She runs tours of the stalactite caves on the Island now. She discovered them after she started the ferry up. Theyre meant to be almost as good as the Cheddar caves. Charlie met her two summers ago and ever since his Scout camps have been as near to Hillside and the Sandylands as he can decently make them.But why Elsa of BrabantShe called him Lohengrin to begin with its to do with the ferry. And he was with the White Swan patrol at the time.A boat drawn by a white swan I see said Maribel. But three years is a long time to stay keen on someone when theres no hope of it going further. Or is thereHope I havent the faintest idea. I havent seen Elsa in some time. Shes a lovely girl but Ive got my own Company to look after now I cant simply traipse around after Charlie the way I used to do.And a good thing too said Maribel both for your girls and for you. Come down to dinner. Lets hope the boys are all planned out by now.The boys had indeed finished their discussions about the great Scout Jamboree they were to run that coming summer and the four sat down to dinner with just a little teasing between husband and wife and brother and sister until dessert had been served and Mike mentioned that Charlie had been suggesting Sandylands for the coming Jamboree.At this Nell and Maribel shared a significant glance which Mike did not miss. Charlie what are you up to he demanded.Charlie raised his hands as though he was fending off an attack from Nell and Maribel. Ive done nothing Mike. Ive no idea why theyNo idea exclaimed Nell. When you know you keep planning Scout camps for the Sandylands so that you can go visit Elsa of Brabant Charlie Masterman you tell Scout Mike the truthElsa of Brabant asked Mike. I say Charlie I agree with your sister. I used to be your Leader you know. I expect you to tell me whats going on. Loyal and Trustworthy remember.Might I have some coffee while I tell my tale Missus Maribel asked Charlie plaintively. Be kind to a poor boyNell grinned first at her brother and then at Maribel pouring out Charlies coffee. Do you see what I meant about his puppydog eyesI do Nell. I pity you.Oh will you girls stop said Mike. I want to know what the lad means by talking about princesses.Only one princess Charlie protested and even thats just a nickname. She started off by calling me Lohengrin and Charlie told the story of how he had first met Elsa Dale while he and his troop had been camping in the Sandylands.When the tale was finished Mike sat sipping his coffee thoughtfully. You like this girl Nell he asked.Quite a lot replied Nell. Shes perfectly jolly. Her elder sister is Daphne Dale the dancer from the Antoine you know but Elsa loves her little bungalow on the sands and is quite happy there. And since she found the caves her life has been easier than it initially looked like being.Maribel what do you think of all this asked Mike.Ive heard it for the first time tonight dear said Maribel from the opposite end of the table. But if Charlie doesnt object we havent seen these caves of Miss Elsa Dale. Dont you think it might be a nice excursion for us and Nell and Charlie to go down to the Sandylands and this island for a day and have tea at the bungalow and meet Charlies Miss Elsa. Nell dear what did you say the name of the island wasNell was trying hard not to laugh at Maribels sudden transformation into a sweet little wife. Caer Ogo.I believe we should plan a visit to Caer Ogo Mike.Jolly good plan said Mike barely managing not to laugh himself. What about it CharlieCan I do anything to stop you Charlie asked.No chorused the other three in unison.,General Audiences,Special FriendsGuides and Scouts
https://archiveofourown.org/works/9493139,Dry My Dreaming,Tony poked his computer although he really didnt have any illusions about coming up with a lead. Lance Corporal Richards had been into some shady stuff but it wasnt the sort Tony could investigate. Give him a strip club or a BDSM club or a country club or even a gay club and Tony could slide right into the role. He could wear a thousand masks some hed worn for years.But Richards had himself some mojo. He was a shaman or a magic user and that was one community Tony couldnt charm his way into. They were an insular group and had about as much patience with law enforcement as the average gang member. Not that he was being fair with that comparison. Tony got that. For the most part they were lawabiding people. People who had magic. And who didnt like feds or cops or anyone in authority.Tony hated this case.Ellie came in with an extra coffee and put it on the edge of his desk. AnythingUnless I can wave a magic wand Tony twirled his finger in the air. The worst part was that it felt like Gibbs expected him to do exactly that. The mans normal level of bastard had risen to epic new heights since Ziva had left. Tony would assume it was age and general bad temperament but Gibbs killed himself trying to be nice to Bishop.Bishop settled on the edge of her desk. Im pretty sure that people with Talent dont appreciate magic wand jokes.Tony knew thatthats why he made them. After all he had a reputation as an equal opportunity insulter to uphold.Wheres Gibbs Ellie asked.Off fighting some jurisdiction battle in the toothpicks office Tony said. The FBI wanted in on this dog of a case. Normally Tony would have given them all the evidence with a bow on the top but Gibbs and Marines. Tony wasnt surprised that he felt a need to fight over it.TimDown with Abby. She has friends in the crystal magic end of the gene pool. Shes calling and seeing if any of them can get us introductions.Then whats Tim doing Ellie asked.Sometimes she was so painfully clueless when it came to investigating. Tony wished that just once Gibbs would hire someone who actually had experience in investigations. Every other team got criminal justice majors and former cops or even military people out of JAG investigations. Gibbs insisted he wanted people who would think outside the box and that inevitably led to some huge learning curves. Luckily Ellie was sharp. Shed catch on and until she did Tony would just need to make sure she didnt damage their cases.Abbys not a field agent and if these contacts end up bringing us evidence we need to make sure Tim can testify about how we communicated with them. We dont want to ever put Abby in a position where she has to testify about anything other than her forensics. Always shield the technical people from the lawyers. That should be a rule but the closest Gibbs came was rule 13 never involve lawyers and the dreaded rule 44. Tony would have altered that one. Some women like Ziva didnt need hiding.He wondered where she was now.Ah Ellie said. That makes sense. Thanks.Tony nodded and tried to focus on his computer again. Richards had sixteen dollars in the bank and a bad ass sound system in his apartment. Tonys gut said that he was living outside his means so Tony needed to figure out who he might owe money. Digging through computer records was more Tims thing so Tony started working on the base records trying to figure out which Marines were most likely to be on duty at the same time. Borrowing from your buddies was a favorite of moochers.So do you think his Talent had anything to do with his death Ellie pulled her legs up under her so she was sitting crosslegged on the desk.Could be Tony said although he wasnt quick to jump to that conclusion. After all not everything centered around magic.You dont think so. Why Ellie leaned forward. She was so damn eager that sometimes it made Tony feel old. Itd been a long time since hed been that unjaded. Tim had been and back then Tony had more patience for the childlike wonder. These days he had to rein in his temper to avoid lashing out at Bishop. It wasnt her fault that he felt like old brittle paper. Channeling a younger and more patient version of himself Tony constructed a new mask. After shrugging he leaned back in his chair. Just because hes a shaman doesnt mean he does much with his Talent.But he has Talent.Sure Tony agreed. But that doesnt mean he even told people he had it. The Marines arent big fans of magic and he might have gone to the Djedi center for any number of reasons. Thats why I want to talk to the other guys in his unit. Im not going to assume his magic is the reason someone put three bullets in his head.But if it is related to his Talent were going to have a tough time investigating.Tony grimaced. That was too true. He could talk to senior see if senior could introduce him to someone in the local Djedi center but senior hated having anyone know about his status as a shaman not unless it helped him impress someone. Tony didnt want to start announcing his fathers status to everyone in the office not when Senior had been randomly showing up. As much as Senior played the doting parent these days Tony knew full well that the older man had the ability to inflict a heavy emotional toll if Tony stepped on his toes.Not that Senior returned the favor. He was too happy to tell embarrassing stories from Tonys youth.I just hope Gibbs gets the Djedi center to cooperate. I know their records are confidential but Richards deserves justice.Richards was killed with bullets not lightning or from a building falling on his head. I still say a mundane killed him.You have evidence to back up that assumption Gibbs asked as he came down the stairs. No boss.Then keep it to yourself.What did Vance say Ellie asked. There was a day that Tony would have dared that question but that day was long gone. Some days Tony was so tired that he figured he was close enough to quitting that he didnt dare bring the wrath of Gibbs down on his head.We have twenty four hours to solve this before he brings in the FBIs Talent team. I want this solved before then. Gibbs words were clipped and angry but that was no surprise. If Vance threatened to give Gibbs case to someone else he probably got an earful. It couldnt happen to a nicer guy.DiNozzo do you know anyone who could get us an introduction to the Djedi centerTony paused a second too long and Gibbs sharp gaze snapped up pinning Tony in place. DiNozzo he said his voice a low growl. Tony used to find that sexy.No one I can call Tony said. He really didnt need Senior in the middle of this mess. Tim is trying to talk his way in through a friend of Abbys. Tony braced himself to get shot down. Id like to go talk to some of Richards team members. He seems a little loose with the money.Gibbs stared at Tony for a long time and Tony imagined thought bubbles above Gibbs head. Gibbs probably assumed that Tonys contact at the Djedi center was an exgirlfriend Tony had treated badly. The man did tend to assume the worst. But after a second Gibbs nodded and sank down into his chair. Take Bishop he ordered.Got it Tony agreed. Come on Bishop.Tony sometimes wondered what she thought of them. She was a watcher but so far Tony hadnt heard any whispers about her talking to anyone in the office. She probably went home and told her husband all about the dysfunctional relationships in the MCRT. Tony couldnt care. He grabbed his weapon and bag and headed for the elevator Ellie at his six.She didnt speak until the elevator doors closed. Why cant we just head over to the Djedi centerBecause its the Talent equivalent of a church and a community center and a hospital all wrapped up in one. The second we show our badges were going to get invited to leave. Tony had only been to one Djedi center and that had been in Baltimore. Hed found that the people were far nicer than the other detectives had told him to expect but still they wouldnt give him any information.Is it really a church That wasnt any easy answer and Tony wasnt in the community so he didnt know for sure. Senior had been bitterly disappointed when Tony never showed any sign of Talent. Hed accused Tony of being weak just like his alcoholic mother. Senior might be kinder and gentler now but Tony still remembered the man who had disowned Tony at twelve and the asshole who had abandoned Tony in a strange hotel flying home without a second thought for his minor son.Anyone else would have had Child Services crawling up their ass but Senior had charmed them all. It was the only shamanic skill senior had ever developed and he hated Tony for being immune to it.Tony shrugged.I know they have tax exempt status but one of the new directors is actually an FBI agent. Theres a lot of chatter that the center might be more open to law enforcement requests now.Tony gave a noncommittal hum and let her chatter on. It was how she made all the information in her head fit together so Tony didnt really mind her chatterhe just wished she was less enthusiastic. Hopefully Tony could bring back a lead on Richards murder. Then he could get Gibbs off his back and hopefully get home in time to go to bed early. Tony knew his increasing need for sleep was a bad sign but he didnt have the energy to do anything about it. It took all his focus to get the job done. There was nothing left for himself.But that was okay as long as Tony had enough to get Richards his justice.,Mature,Not Found
https://archiveofourown.org/works/47947405,Meu √¥mega precioso,Boa leitura One Àè Àã ÀéÀä ùëøùíäùíÇùíê ùíÅùíâùíÇùíè Àè Àã ÀéÀä Olhando para o c√©u escuro Xiao Zhan estremeceu. Seu pesco√ßo fez um som alto de estalo. Seus p√©s do√≠am e sua camisa estava √∫mida de suor por baixo da jaqueta imperme√°vel que usava. A chuva finalmente parou mas pesadas nuvens cinzentas ainda pairavam sobre a floresta obscurecendo a vista da Colina da Sepultura. A chuva torrencial causou estragos nas partes baixas do Parque Nacional de Yiling e o caminho para Yunmeng foi inundado. No entanto o xerife Li Bowen ficaria feliz em saber que a estrada sinuosa ao longo das encostas at√© a esta√ß√£o Cayi estava livre.Xiao Zhan havia visitado as duas pontes na estrada e elas estavam intactas. Ele chamaria o xerife assim que estivesse mais perto da fronteira do parque e de seu chal√©. Aqui no meio da floresta ele n√£o tinha servi√ßo telef√¥nico.Com as cal√ßas molhadas e as botas sujas de lama o alfa caminhou pelo caminho de cascalho de volta para seu jipe. O que √© que foi issoUm flash de cor na densa vegeta√ß√£o. Ele fez uma pausa. Era uma mochila o vermelho brilhando forte contra o verde escuro da floresta. Ele se aproximou e pulou a vala que corria ao longo da estrada. O conte√∫do estava espalhado sob os arbustos de mirtilo um saco de dormir embalado uma lanterna duas garrafas de √°gua vazias roupas amarrotadas um par de botas de caminhada uma toalha pacotes de comida seca algumas latas e um grande recipiente de prote√≠na em p√≥. . Ele teria reclamado sobre os caminhantes de fim de semana deixarem lixo para tr√°s mas isso parecia diferente. Os suprimentos estavam praticamente intactos apenas em desordem e molhados pela chuva recente. Apreensivo Xiao Zhan caminhou em um c√≠rculo amplo mais longe do equipamento de acampamento abandonado at√© que se viu de volta ao Rio Frio.Na margem arenosa do rio em uma cavidade entre as ra√≠zes retorcidas expostas dos pinheiros ao redor jazia um corpo. O menino estava nu da cintura para baixo as m√£os fl√°cidas cobrindo sua virilha. Ele estava enrolado de lado e a √°gua fria batia em seus p√©s. Ele parecia estar no final da adolesc√™ncia ou talvez no in√≠cio dos vinte anos pequeno e esguio. Seu cabelo molhado castanho grudava na testa e nas t√™mporas. Ele usava um Henley cinza claro que estava encharcado e coberto com manchas escuras de lama e musgo. Seus dedos estavam arranhados as unhas sujas como se ele tivesse cavado o ch√£o com as pr√≥prias m√£os. Apesar da sujeira que o cobria a beleza do estranho brilhava de forma √≥bvia perturbadora em sua quietude e Xiao Zhan se encolheu de horror com o que poderia ter acontecido.Ele se agachou ao lado do menino inconsciente e verificou o b√°sico. Respirando bem pulso firme e forte sua pele fria mas fora isso ele parecia saud√°vel. Seus l√°bios estavam p√°lidos por√©m quase azuis por causa do frio √∫mido. Tocar o garoto seminu sem sua permiss√£o parecia muito errado mas Xiao Zhan teve que verificar se havia sangue ou hematomas. Ele encontrou alguns ferimentos nos p√©s do jovem mas sua profundidade era dif√≠cil de examinar. A pele estava macerada quase branca depois de muito tempo na √°gua.Xiao Zhan tirou a jaqueta de l√£ e cobriu o menino com ela.O que fazer agora Ele deveria chamar os guardas florestais Xerife Bowen Com a inunda√ß√£o em Yunmeng e nas √°reas mais baixas do parque tanto Bowen quanto os guardas florestais estavam atentos √†s emerg√™ncias. E eles precisariam de um helic√≥ptero para chegar aqui.O chal√© de Xiao Zhan ficava a apenas trinta minutos de dist√¢ncia a estrada intacta. Verificar o telefone e lembrar que n√£o tinha sinal facilitou a decis√£o do alfa.Ele levaria o jovem para o chal√© e ligaria para Bowen de l√°. E o Doutor JiLi.O menino reagiu sutilmente aos toques de Xiao Zhan suspirando e se contorcendo mas n√£o abriu os olhos. Exaust√£o hipotermia. O tempo n√£o estava t√£o frio definitivamente acima de vinte e cinco graus mas o menino estava seminu com os p√©s no rio e a camisa ensopada. Sim hipotermia.Voc√™ est√° seguro. Vou levar voc√™ para algum lugar quente.Ele n√£o obteve resposta al√©m de um gemido suave.S√≥ um minuto. Vou tirar voc√™ daqui.Xiao Zhan o carregou at√© seu jipe. Depois de meia milha ele teve que se sentar em um tronco de √°rvore ca√≠do e recuperar o f√¥legoQue diabos o garoto estava fazendo aqui sozinho Ele n√£o seria o primeiro alpinista a subestimar a Colina da Sepultura. O pico mais alto do parque recebeu esse nome por isso mesmo. Mas como ele acabou desmaiado seminu nas margens do Rio Frio a quinze metros de dist√¢ncia de seu saco de dormir e comida Uma inunda√ß√£o repentina o varreu quando ele se lavou Embora a √°gua n√£o tenha atingido a estrada de cascalho aqui os n√≠veis devem ter sido altos para causar tanto dano mais abaixo. Xiao Zhan n√£o conseguiu pensar em nenhuma outra explica√ß√£o.O menino se mexeu e passou os bra√ßos em volta do pesco√ßo de Xiao Zhan enterrando o rosto na camisa. Ele estremeceu e respirou fundo como se estivesse sentindo o cheiro do alfa. Ele parecia faminto por calor e contato humano.Shh eu peguei voc√™.Frio.Eu sei desculpe. Aliviado por o menino estar um tanto consciente Xiao Zhan levantouse. Estamos chegando .Ele finalmente alcan√ßou o carro e colocou o menino no banco do passageiro ent√£o o ajustou para que ele pudesse se recostar confortavelmente. Ele enfiou a jaqueta de l√£ nos quadris do menino e o envolveu em um cobertor que mantinha no banco de tr√°s para emerg√™ncias. Satisfeito com o fato de o menino estar afivelado e coberto dormindo profundamente Xiao Zhan voltou para pegar o equipamento de acampamento molhado. Enfiou tudo na mochila que jogou nas costas. O saco de dormir encharcado n√£o cabia ent√£o o agarrou e correu para o carro.O menino dormiu durante toda a viagem de trinta minutos at√© o chal√© onde o alfa vivia. Ele mal se mexeu quando o alfa o carregou para dentro e o deitou no sof√° da sala.Onde eu t√¥ ele murmurou os olhos ainda fechados.Um sinal definitivo de consci√™ncia. Xiao Zhan sorriu grato.Voc√™ est√° seguro. Eu sou Xiao Zhan e voc√™ est√° na minha casa na fronteira do Parque Nacional.Xiao Zhan ele repetiu baixinho como se estivesse memorizando.Sim sou eu..Sua camisa est√° molhada. Eu preciso tir√°la.O menino assentiu lentamente seus c√≠lios tremulando. Xiao Zhan agarrou a bainha e tirou o Henley. Ele encontrou apenas pele clara e m√∫sculos magros sem feridas ou contus√µes.Voc√™ est√° machucado Voc√™ est√° com dorUma respira√ß√£o. N√£o.Ele envolveu o menino em um cobertor macio e colocou dois travesseiros sob sua cabe√ßa e pesco√ßo.Vou trazer algo para voc√™ beber e ent√£o voc√™ pode dormir. Quer que eu ligue para algu√©m Seus pais Um amigoN√£o. N√£o Ele balan√ßou a cabe√ßa violentamente suas m√£os se sacudindo sob o cobertor.OK. Uma bebida ent√£o.De repente um punho agarrou o pulso de Xiao Zhan com uma for√ßa surpreendente. Os olhos do menino se abriram. Eram da cor da terra em um dia ensolarado. Olhos impressionantes e profundos quase pretos ao redor das c√≥rneas.N√£o posso... n√£o posso ficarCom o peito dolorido de compaix√£o impotente Xiao Zhan passou a m√£o sobre o couro cabeludo do menino e os lindos e inquietantes olhos se fecharam.N√£o se preocupe com nada. Ningu√©m pode te machucar aqui.Satisfeito com o menino ter se acalmado Xiao Zhan se levantou e foi at√© a cozinha. L√≠quido e alimentospara o garoto Ele rapidamente fez um shake de prote√≠na e depois pegou um copo de √°gua tamb√©m. No meio do caminho para a sala ele se virou voltou para a cozinha e colocou uma colher de a√ß√∫car no shake. Carboidratos r√°pidos n√£o fazem mal.Seu convidado havia desmaiado novamente ent√£o Xiao Zhan gentilmente o sacudiu para acord√°lo.Beba isto. Vamos l√°. Vou deixar voc√™ dormir depois disso mas voc√™ precisa beber isso.O menino chupou o canudo e engoliu. Ele engoliu avidamente metade do shake.√Ågua tamb√©m. Vamos l√°. S√≥ um pouco.Ele bebeu olhos fechados e ent√£o seu corpo ficou mole.N√£o posso ficar aqui ele sussurrou mas n√£o fez nenhum esfor√ßo para se mover.Xiao Zhan nunca tinha visto algu√©m t√£o exausto.N√£o se preocupe com nada al√©m de dormir. Voc√™ precisa recuperar sua for√ßa primeiro. Vou chamar um m√©dico para verificar voc√™.N√£o N√£o ligue para ningu√©m. Por favor n√£oXiao Zhan pegou a m√£o do menino e apertou delicadamente seus dedos. Com a outra m√£o ele acariciou seu cabelo. Tudo bem. Voc√™ est√° seguro.Com o que parecia ser o √∫ltimo de suas for√ßas o menino levantou a cabe√ßa. N√£o diga a ningu√©m que estou aqui.OK. eu n√£o vou. Eu prometo.Dentro de um minuto ele caiu de volta em um sono profundo. Xiao Zhan levou um momento para estud√°lo. Mesmo abatido depois do que devem ter sido dias sozinho na floresta suas fei√ß√µes eram lindas. Boca carnuda olhos grandes inchados de cansa√ßo nariz pequeno e estreito ma√ß√£s do rosto salientes e um maxilar marcante e elegante. Seu queixo tinha uma fenda rasa quase impercept√≠vel no centro. Ele tinha o tom de pele claro de algu√©m acostumado a estar ao ar livre e sua pele era luminosa quase brilhante como cetim. Ele era muito jovem para o crescimento da barba ou naturalmente sem barba.Xiao Zhan acariciou seu cabelo por um longo tempo desejando poder ajudar mais. Os fios come√ßaram a enrolar enquanto secavam. Determinado a fazer algo √∫til Xiao Zhan trouxe seu kit de primeiros socorros e limpou as feridas superficiais nos p√©s do menino provavelmente cortes e arranh√µes por andar descal√ßo no rio. Ent√£o ele acendeu o fogo na lareira da sala embora nunca o fizesse no ver√£o. Quando seu h√≥spede dormia o pior de sua exaust√£o Xiao Zhan descobriria como ajud√°lo a sair de qualquer confus√£o em que ele se meteu. E se n√£o visse nenhuma melhora no estado do jovem ligaria para o Dr. JiLi em Yunmeng independentemente dos protestos de seu convidado.. .Voc√™ n√£o precisa de mim Zhuocheng. Xiao Zhan manteve a voz baixa para que seu telefonema n√£o perturbasse seu convidado. Ele havia passado o resto do dia trabalhando na cozinha em vez de seu lugar habitual na poltrona da sala. Sua mente voltava para o garoto a cada minuto impossibilitando que ele se concentrasse.Ele n√£o tinha paci√™ncia para seu irm√£o mais novo hoje.Eu n√£o Zhuocheng concordou energicamente. Mas isso n√£o significa que eu n√£o preferiria que voc√™ estivesse aqui. Voc√™ fez uma pausa e todos n√≥s respeitamos isso mas j√° faz eras Xiao Zhan .Eu nunca chamei isso de pausa. Voc√™ chamou.Bem parecia √≥bvio. Voc√™ estava prestes a se casar com YuBin e sair de licen√ßa parental onde deveria ficar entediado e frustrado. Ent√£o voc√™ deveria voltar ansioso para brincar com os adultos novamente.Por que seu irm√£o mencionou seu noivado fracassado A perda ainda era dolorosa para Xiao Zhan . N√£o a perda do homem ele n√£o se arrependeu de ter perdido YuBin. Xiao Zhan esperava que seu afastamento da vida p√∫blica e da linha de frente dos neg√≥cios da fam√≠lia os aproximasse. No entanto no final de seu relacionamento sua incompatibilidade tornouse √≥bvia. Xiao Zhan ainda lamentava sua fam√≠lia imaginada.Zhuocheng era jovem quando se casou com Haiukan e se tornou pai sua paternidade era algo natural. Eles tiveram tr√™s filhos e Zhuo costumava brincar sobre invejar Xiao Zhan por sua liberdade e sono ininterrupto. Eles estavam felizes no entanto. Xiao Zhan podia v√™lo sempre que o visitavam. Seu irm√£o mais novo nunca entenderia o desgosto que Xiao Zhan sentiu quando depois de seis anos juntos YuBin declarou com calma e determina√ß√£o que nunca iria querer filhos.Eu n√£o vou voltar Zhuocheng. Estou feliz onde estou.Voc√™ gosta de programar porque pode trabalhar remotamente e bancar o eremita por meses a fio.Isso √© preciso.Zhuocheng pensou que o coment√°rio do eremita iria insult√°loEle gemeu ao telefone. Eu ainda quero voc√™ na reuni√£o agendada do conselho. Em pessoa. O resto podemos tratar online. Eu n√£o ligo. Mas voc√™ estar√° aqui na pr√≥xima semana sapatos limpos e gravata. Prometeme..Yizhou acha que eu n√£o preciso estar presente.Voc√™ estar√° aqui. N√£o me importo se houver outra inunda√ß√£o ou se os ursos invadirem Yunmeng Voc√™ vem mesmo que tenha que descer a montanha em uma maldita jangada.Veremos.Xiao Zhan estou dizendo isso como seu CEO n√£o como seu irm√£o mais novo.Xiao Zhan riu. Zhuocheng e Yizhou dirigiam a empresa h√° anos. Zhuocheng tinha as habilidades sociais autoridade e energia e Yizhou tinha o c√©rebro anal√≠tico e matem√°tico mantendo os n√∫meros altos. Xiao Zhan suspeitava que Zhuocheng s√≥ o queria mais envolvido para obter a aprova√ß√£o de seu irm√£o mais velho.Zhuo eu confio em voc√™. Eu me preocupo com minha fam√≠lia e me preocupo com os neg√≥cios. Eu realmente acho que voc√™ pode fazer isso melhor do que eu.O ca√ßula grunhiu apaziguado pelo elogio.Eu irei para a reuni√£o do conselho. SatisfeitoSim. Use uma gravata. Ou eu juro que vou jogar papai em voc√™.Eu tamb√©m te amo querido irm√£o.Rindo Xiao Zhan desligou. Ele desligou o som e deslizou o telefone no bolso.Ele passou pela sala e olhou para dentro. O jovem dormia havia seis horas. Xiao Zhan foi chec√°lo algumas vezes mas sempre o encontrava na mesma posi√ß√£o enrolado de lado sob o cobertor as m√£os enfiadas sob a cabe√ßa os l√°bios secos entreabertos. Sua pele estava mais quente suas bochechas haviam recuperado um pouco de cor e sua respira√ß√£o estava calma e est√°vel. Adivinhando que seu convidado iria querer se vestir quando acordasse Xiao Zhan comprou para ele um moletom limpo e uma camiseta. Muito grande mas eles teriam que servir. Ele colocou as roupas no apoio de bra√ßo perto da cabe√ßa do menino e voltou para a cozinha para seu laptop.Eram cerca de oito da noite e Xiao Zhan estava guardando os copos da m√°quina de lavar lou√ßa enquanto tentava esticar o pesco√ßo dolorido. Ele passou muitas horas encolhido acima da telinha lendo relat√≥rios e escrevendo notas de feedback. Por sorte amanh√£ seria s√°bado. Sem trabalho nem emails Ele vai correr e fazer seus exerc√≠cios ou suas costas v√£o te odiar de novo.Ele deveria acordar seu convidado e aliment√°loUm gemido suave veio da sala de estar. Ele se virou e correu para o lado do menino.As brasas na lareira ainda brilhavam fazendo com que a sala de estar parecesse muito mais quente do que o resto da casa. Xiao Zhan imediatamente se sentiu desconfortavelmente quente. Ele deveria abrir a janela eO cheiro o abordou a cerca de tr√™s metros do sof√°. Para seu horror a boca de Xiao Zhan salivou seus m√∫sculos ficaram tensos e suas narinas dilataram. Seu p√™nis ficou duro em um instante a base formigando com uma press√£o familiar. O aroma delicioso e fascinante encheu seu ventre com desejo derretido e confundiu seu c√©rebro.Como ele pode ter sido t√£o est√∫pidoO estranho estava no cio.Merda.Mas ele parecia t√£o jovem. Ele deve ser mais velho do que parecia. E como √© que Xiao Zhan n√£o tinha sentido o cheiro dele antes Haveria manchas secas em sua pele. Voc√™ o encontrou na porra do rio Xiao Zhan . Claro voc√™ n√£o podia sentir o cheiro dele.Sinto muito seu convidado disse asperamente.N√£o √© sua culpa Xiao Zhan resmungou ainda congelado no meio da sala lutando contra a rea√ß√£o primitiva de seu corpo ao forte cheiro. O que ele deveria fazer agora V√° embora Ele n√£o podia simplesmente deixar o menino em agonia por horas sozinho. Um homem. N√£o um menino. Um jovem √¥mega no cio aqui em seu chal√©. Bem isso √© um desastre do caralho.Outro gemido outro gemido. O corpo magro e rijo convulsionou sob os cobertores.Com os punhos cerrados os m√∫sculos vibrando Xiao Zhan vasculhou freneticamente sua mente em busca de algo qualquer coisa. Havia dispositivos. Brinquedos sexuais projetados para √¥megas para que eles pudessem sobreviver aos dez dias de necessidade torturante sem um parceiro. Mas Xiao Zhan n√£o tinha nada disso aqui. Yunmeng ficava a uma curta dist√¢ncia mas a loja mal tinha pasta de dente e produtos de barbear muito menos brinquedos sexuais avan√ßados. Ah e a estrada tinha sido inundada. Porra.Por favorO corpo do jovem curvouse e o cobertor escorregou. Xiao Zhan imediatamente fechou os olhos. Ele plantou os p√©s firmemente no ch√£o para n√£o chegar mais perto antes de ter um plano. Ele precisava de um plano.Me ajudeN√£o posso. N√£o h√° nada que eu possa fazer. Eu n√£o tenho nada.Ajuda Por favorOs dentes do √¥mega batiam as unhas arranhavam as almofadas do sof√° mas Xiao Zhan se recusou a olhar para cima. Seus m√∫sculos estavam contra√≠dos para atacar.N√£o posso. Eu n√£o posso fazer isso com ele.Voc√™ n√£o me conhece. N√£o posso tirar vantagem de voc√™.N√£o... tirando vantagem. Apenas. N√£o. AffRespira√ß√µes ofegantes rosnados gemidos de dor.Xiao Zhan cerrou os dentes.N√£o posso deix√°lo aqui. Eu n√£o posso me aproximar dele. Eu n√£o posso fazer nada. Porra de merda Pensa ZhanOutro gemido. Mais alto.Por favor Isso d√≥i. Porra d√≥iUm gemido profundo e gutural.Porra o cheiro N√£o olhe. N√£o olhe para ele.Ele poderia se virar e sair. Tranque o chal√© e espere do lado de fora. Xiao Zhan tinha ouvido falar sobre √¥megas se machucando gravemente at√© mesmo se matando. Ele poderia amarr√°lo. Segureo se necess√°rio. E depois Esperar at√© que a onda de calor desapare√ßa Isso seria tortura.Que porra o homem estava fazendo sozinho no meio da floresta Durante seu cioDepois de alguns segundos ofegando silenciosamente a voz tr√™mula se ergueu novamente. Sem palavras desta vez apenas alguns gemidos e ent√£o um longo grito de ang√∫stia.As m√£os de Xiao Zhan tremiam.O cheiro ficou ainda mais forte. Ent√£o um baque soou na sala.Os olhos de Xiao Zhan se abriram contra sua vontade. Seu p√™nis chorava dentro de sua cueca suas bolas apertadas contra seu corpo e ele gemeu com a vis√£o na frente dele.O corpo jovem e esguio se contorcia no ch√£o contorcendose em agonia. O √¥mega ficou de joelhos e estendeu a m√£o para Xiao Zhan apenas para cair novamente. Ambas as m√£os em sua virilha ele massageou seu pau duro e bolas. Dedos arranharam em seu vinco tentando empurrar para dentro de si mesmo. Seus m√∫sculos musculosos incharam e sua pele brilhava com uma camada de suor. Ele era lindo. E ele estava sofrendo. Cada c√©lula do corpo de Xiao Zhan gravitou em dire√ß√£o ao cheiro delicioso cada instinto gritando para ele tocar e acalmar.N√£o me deixe assim o homem for√ßou.N√£o posso. N√£o posso usar voc√™.Miseric√≥rdia... por favor... tenha miseric√≥rdia.Isso d√≥iEle est√° implorando por miseric√≥rdia.A palavra quebrou algo dentro de Xiao Zhan .Ajude . N√£o pense. Proteja acalme. Foda ele. √â a √∫nica maneira de ajud√°lo. Foda ele.Quando Xiao Zhan cedeu aos seus instintos a onda de energia o surpreendeu. Por uma fra√ß√£o de segundo ele poderia ter esmagado pedras com as pr√≥prias m√£os enquanto a for√ßa bruta flu√≠a por seus membros. Em tr√™s passadas ele estava ao lado do homem jogando sua camisa fora desabotoando os bot√µes e empurrando a cal√ßa jeans pelas pernas. Ele precisa pele com pele. Shh. Te peguei.Toque me Oh por favorEle levantou o homem tr√™mulo de quatro e separou suas n√°degas. Uma umidade clara escorria do buraco aberto e o cheiro estava deixando Xiao Zhan louco de desejo. T√£o suave e t√£o jovem.Maravilhoso. A min√∫scula abertura rosada se fechou ritmicamente na frente dos olhos de Xiao Zhan e o √¥mega gemeu novamente.Me foda Ele gritou as palavras sua voz quebrando.Apenas fa√ßa. Xiao Zhan alinhou sua cabe√ßa e empurrou para dentro em um longo golpe.Aaah O som que o jovem fez reverberou por toda a casa. Al√≠vio paix√£o gratid√£o. O buraco escorregadio se apertou ao redor do p√™nis de Xiao Zhan . Xiao Zhan teve que se mover. Porra Fazia anos desde que ele sentiu esse tipo √∫nico de desejo. O corpo ansioso de um √¥mega deslizando para mais perto dele a carne aquecida o buraco molhado e necessitado os tremores e pequenos espasmos massageando o comprimento de seu p√™nis... E o cheiro. Porra o cheiro. Eu vou conseguir dar um n√≥ nele.O homem estava empurrando seu p√™nis para tr√°s solu√ßando de desejo. Drogado pelos ferom√¥nios Xiao Zhan acelerou fodendoo com mais for√ßa. Demorou talvez trinta segundos e o homem veio. Seu buraco apertou como um torno ao redor do p√™nis de Xiao Zhan e o cheiro mudou transformandose em algo cem vezes mais forte. Calor virgem . As narinas de Xiao Zhan dilataram e ele mostrou os dentes em um rosnado.N√£o posso parar. N√£o para. O estranho choramingou. Por que n√£o paraEle precisa que eu fique s√£o caramba Xiao Zhan agarrou os quadris do homem com mais for√ßa. N√£o lute contra isso. Deixa acontecer. Apenas continue vindo. Ele empurrou ainda mais forte at√© que o quarto ecoou com bofetadas molhadas de pele contra pele. Venha at√© mim AgoraOutro orgasmo ondulou pelo corpo jovem mais forte desta vez seu buraco pulsando e pinto jorrando gotas de esperma por todo o ch√£o de Xiao Zhan . Xiao Zhan tentou respirar pela boca para ficar pelo menos um pouco racional mas o jovem e belo √¥mega n√£o facilitou.Mais Por favorEle prolongou suas estocadas deixando o homem sentir todo o seu comprimento. O buraco aquecido estava pingando liso por dentro macio como seda e cada estocada era uma pequena amostra do para√≠so. Os sons do √¥mega mudaram em vez de gemer de p√¢nico e necessidade ele agora gemia de prazer sua voz mais profunda gutural. E Xiao Zhan ficou maravilhado com a perfeita harmonia de sua paix√£o. Um milagre realmente.√â isso. √â assim que deveria ser. Xiao Zhan acariciou as costas do √¥mega suavemente ent√£o estendeu a m√£o e acariciou seu p√™nis tenso. Seu convidado estremeceu e gritou com o que parecia puro deleite. O formigamento na base da ere√ß√£o de Xiao Zhan se intensificou e os m√∫sculos de sua bunda e coxas inundaram de calor enquanto ele se movia os ferom√¥nios do √¥mega alimentando seu corpo sem levar em conta sua vontade racional. No final ele ouviu seu pr√≥prio conselho e deixou acontecer. Seu corpo sabia melhor. Ele deve ter encontrado o ritmo e o √¢ngulo certos porque o homem embaixo dele delirou de prazer.Obrigado... ah Obrigado... SimSe ele pr√≥prio n√£o estivesse louco de desejo teria rido da gratid√£o do jovem por ter seu traseiro fodido.Preciso dar um n√≥ em voc√™ alertou Xiao Zhan ou n√£o vai embora.Eu sei. Um gemido necessitado. Fa√ßa isso. N√£o pare. Por favor n√£o pare. Oh sim. L√°. SimSinto muito que tenha que ser assim.√â bom. T√£o bom. N√£o pareInferno o cheiro. Xiao Zhan inalou com a boca engolindo o ar enchendo os pulm√µes ardentes com a fragr√¢ncia. Ele sentiu at√© o est√¥mago a ess√™ncia do estranho permeando todo o seu ser incitandoo a se mover mais r√°pido foder mais forte mergulhar mais fundo at√© que ele ro√ßasse contra o corpo aberto em seus bra√ßos como um animal seu longo p√™nis afundando profundamente. nas entranhas do homem menor. Eles n√£o podiam mais falar. Apenas suspiros agudos de √™xtase sa√≠am de suas gargantas a cada estocada forte.O estranho gritou com outro orgasmo mais longo e ainda mais intenso e seu corpo convulsionou. O buraco aquecido apertou mais forte do que nunca e Xiao Zhan viu estrelas. Parecia que uma boca faminta o estava sugando os fortes m√∫sculos internos do √¥mega ordenhando seu p√™nis extraindo sua semente de suas bolas.Os olhos de Xiao Zhan rolaram para tr√°s em sua cabe√ßa. O s√™men jorrou de seu p√™nis e seu n√≥ inchou prendendoos juntos. Envolvendose em torno do corpo tr√™mulo Xiao Zhan n√£o conseguia parar de bombear seus quadris. A intensidade de seu prazer o confundiu. No√ß√µes irracionais floresceram em seu c√©rebro como flores na primavera coloridas e fugazes mas belas ideias tolas de amor e ternura. Ele deve ter esquecido como era quente o sexo. Ele j√° havia sido arrebatado por esse poderoso turbilh√£o de emo√ß√µes antes O jovem √¥mega era o centro de seu mundo. Ele abriu a boca sobre o pesco√ßo do homem em um quase beijo. Proteger acalmar. Ameo. Esses malditos ferom√¥nios.Ele passou os bra√ßos ao redor do torso do estranho e os colocou de lado. Inevitavelmente Xiao Zhan pousou no esperma virgem espalhado no ch√£o de madeira. Oh c√©u. Ele queria rolar nele. Em uma tentativa de se manter sob controle ele cerrou os dentes e pressionou o rosto no cabelo suado do jovem mas seus quadris se inclinaram para frente de qualquer maneira. O √¥mega ficou tenso com outro raio de prazer um profundo gemido gutural reverberando por seu torso. Ele esticou o bra√ßo magro para tr√°s e agarrou a coxa de Xiao Zhan .Xiao Zhan continuou acariciando a pele com cheiro doce. Voc√™ est√° bem ele murmurou sem f√¥lego.Sim. S√≥ preciso de um pouco... ah... mais.O que voc√™ quiser. Xiao Zhan deu outro empurr√£o suave seus quadris apertados contra a linda bunda redonda pressionando o n√≥ com mais for√ßa na pr√≥stata inchada do jovem. Outro gemido profundo.Oh sim. Continue .Algumas estocadas min√∫sculas e a m√£o de Xiao Zhan deslizou para cima e para baixo no p√™nis do √¥mega. A pele parecia veludo em sua m√£o escorregadia em alguns lugares devido √† abund√¢ncia de esperma. O jovem gozou mais uma vez com um suspiro satisfeito as √∫ltimas gotas de sua semente escorrendo pelos dedos de Xiao Zhan . Seu corpo ficou pesado de al√≠vio.A onda de calor havia acabado mas a tens√£o ainda se acumulava na boca do est√¥mago de Xiao Zhan . Sem pensar ele levou a palma da m√£o suja ao rosto e inalou profundamente.Xiao Zhan lambeu o esperma do estranho.O cheiro concentrado e o gosto do calor virgem viraram sua alma do avesso. Seu n√≥ estremeceu com libera√ß√£o imediata e seus quadris estalaram para frente. Atr√°s de suas p√°lpebras fechadas o mundo explodiu em cores vibrantes. Quanto mais ele ofegava de prazer mais forte o cheiro se tornava e ele agarrou a criatura milagrosa que havia encontrado aninhandose o mais fundo que podia naquele corpo flex√≠vel e quente. Ele ouviu seus pr√≥prios gemidos estrondosos. Ele quase podia se ver do lado de fora os quadris no cio os dentes arreganhados contra o pesco√ßo do √¥mega atacando o homem esguio como uma besta irracional.Quando ele ressurgiu do orgasmo mais intenso de sua vida Xiao Zhan se preocupou por ter segurado o homem com muita for√ßa empurrado o n√≥ muito fundo. Mas o √¥mega apenas suspirou um som de profunda satisfa√ß√£o e fadiga. Preenchido com o s√™men de Xiao Zhan sua gl√¢ndula sob a press√£o constante do n√≥ pulsante ele parecia capaz de relaxar.Obrigado. As palavras sa√≠ram em uma expira√ß√£o suave.Voc√™ precisa descansar Xiao Zhan murmurou.O √¥mega estava inerte nos bra√ßos de Xiao Zhan e sua voz era quase inaud√≠vel quando ele murmurou Sinto muito.Shh n√£o se desculpe. Dormir. N√£o pense em nada. Apenas durma.√â t√£o bom dentro de mim.Isso √© bom .Xiao Zhan acariciou os bra√ßos esguios e o peito at√© que pousou a m√£o no abd√¥men liso do jovem. Seu convidado adormeceu r√°pido aberto e macio e Xiao Zhan ficou maravilhado com as sensa√ß√µes. Ele fechou os olhos e vagou por um momento saboreando a perfei√ß√£o de sua uni√£o. Seu n√≥ formigou por toda parte enviando pequenos tent√°culos de alegria em seu c√©rebro como se ele ainda estivesse gozando. O gosto do jovem √¥mega era o afrodis√≠aco mais forte e por um tempo Xiao Zhan n√£o conseguiu pensar em mais nada. Eu poderia te foder a noite toda fazer voc√™ gozar cinco vezes mais. T√£o doce t√£o lindo t√£o sincero. O cheiro de calor enfraqueceu lentamente a excita√ß√£o tornouse administr√°vel e Xiao Zhan encontrou seu caminho de volta para si mesmo. Ele tentou montar o quebracabe√ßa em sua mente. O homem deve ter passado por pelo menos uma onda de calor sozinho na floresta e provavelmente tentou encontrar al√≠vio no rio.Xiao Zhan estremeceu ao pensar nas √°guas agitadas e geladas do Rio Frio. Ele n√£o podia imaginar as horr√≠veis horas de ang√∫stia que o √¥mega deve ter sobrevivido antes de se exaurir at√© a inconsci√™ncia. Xiao Zhan puxou o cobertor do sof√° e cobriu o corpo do √¥mega com ele. Voc√™ est√° segura lindo menino. Descanse. Vou mant√™lo aquecido.Mas e agoraXiao Zhan n√£o poderia ter feito nada para evitar isso. Mesmo se ele soubesse que o estranho estava no cio ele o teria deixado l√° N√£o. O homem pode ter morrido de exaust√£o hipotermia ou automutila√ß√£o. Ele estava t√£o esgotado que nem conseguiu se alimentar. E se algu√©m l√° fora estivesse esperando para reivindic√°lo E se n√£o houvesse ningu√©mO jovem estava dormindo empalado no pau inchado de Xiao Zhan cheio de esperma de Xiao Zhan . Pequenas ondas de prazer percorriam seus corpos unidos a cada minuto. Eles estavam presos juntos da maneira mais √≠ntima mas Xiao Zhan n√£o sabia nada sobre o estranho.Um tremor percorreu o homem adormecido fazendo seu buraco apertar o n√≥ e Xiao Zhan suspirou com desejo renovado. Se ele n√£o estivesse t√£o preocupado com o bemestar do homem ele aceitaria este presente e ficaria grato. A emo√ß√£o de segurar o belo estranho cheirar sua paix√£o e ser aceito t√£o bem dentro dele.Xiao Zhan n√£o se lembrava de ter se sentido t√£o bem. Nem mesmo nas poucas vezes que teve que cuidar da ex durante as baterias.√â o cheiro dele. √önico e impiedoso. Como uma droga.Depois de uma hora quando o perfume que vinha da pele do √¥mega se tornou menos intenso o n√≥ diminuiu. Xiao Zhan ficou enrolado em torno do pequeno corpo dobrado para dentro deixando o homem se ajustar. Depois de alguns minutos ele puxou para fora lentamente. Ele era uma bagun√ßa de lubrifica√ß√£o e s√™men. Ele pegou sua cueca e limpou a dobra do homem e sua pr√≥pria virilha. Ent√£o ele procurou no ch√£o da sala por mais roupas descartadas. Vestindo seu jeans Xiao Zhan pegou o jovem e o carregou escada acima para seu quarto.Ele trouxe toalhas do banheiro uma seca e outra molhada com √°gua morna e lavou o corpo sujo e coberto de suor do jovem do rosto aos p√©s. As m√£os de Xiao Zhan tremiam quando ele deu banho em seu amante inesperado dominado pela ternura e pelo medo. Quem √© voc√™ Como √© que parece que eu te conhe√ßo Deus me ajude mas voc√™ √© perfeito.O √¥mega dormiu durante tudo isso. Xiao Zhan o colocou sob o cobertor e foi tomar banho esperando que isso clareasse seu c√©rebro. Isso n√£o aconteceu.Incapaz de ficar longe ele voltou para seu quarto e deitou ao lado do homem adormecido. Abriu o laptop e tentou ler o relat√≥rio que Yizhou lhe enviara mas logo seus olhos ficaram pesados. Ele colocou o laptop na mesa de cabeceira e virou de lado.Olhando para as fei√ß√µes relaxadas do √¥mega ele se deixou levar.Um movimento em sua cama o despertou. Confuso ele abriu os olhos. Ainda estava escuro. Um corpo estava pressionado contra o dele nu sob as cobertas agarrado a ele. A pele do jovem estava quente agora. Xiao Zhan jogou um bra√ßo sobre ele e dormiu......,Explicit,YOI Omegaverse Week

Somewhere in Time and Space... It was so quiet here... Like a calm and tranquil sea... The sixth of her particular name like other ship spirits who came Here after their time in the mortal world regardless of what would befall their physical hulls once they were either sunk or dismantled the living souls of museum ships hadnt come to this place as far as she could sense had slept pretty much since the day she had finally surrendered to the tender mercies of the breakers who had to come to her final resting place at Saint Michaels Mount near Penzance in Cornwall to do what the Kaiserliche Marine the Kriegsmarine the Luftwaffe and the Regia Marina had singularly failed to do. Heh Grand Old Lady indeed... Huh... Blue blue my world is blue Blue is my world since Im without you. Grey grey my life is grey Cold is my heart since you went away...Hearing that beautiful voice a Greek accent even if the words were clearly English a pair of bright blue eyes opened as the onceformless spirit began to coalesce into something more humanlike. And while ships had been called she since Time immortal as far as she understood what made the captain of Kriegsmarineschiff Bismarck want to call that murder machine which had so easily destroyed His Majestys Ship Hood near the Denmark Strait one bleak May day in 1941 he she would NEVER begin to understand that her very spirit was assuming the form of a graceful woman in her twenties was something she personally hadnt expected since she had forever slipped the bounds of King Neptunes Realm for This Place...Red red my eyes are red Crying for you alone in my bed. Green green my jealous heart I doubted you and now were apart... While long hair as golden as the very Sun itself spilled into her field of vision she felt her shapely body become draped in a glittering silver crystallike bodysuit. It wasnt form fitting actually it seemed quite comfortable as the amassed memories of all those who had helped make the second Queen Elizabethclass fast superdreadnought what she had been for thirty years bearing the Royal Commission from the time of King George V through that of his completely lovestruck eldest son King Edward VIII to that of his longsuffering second son King George VI immediately fell in love with the sheer softness of the fabric now cloaking her definite female form. Wondering what in Gods name was making her be transformed into THIS she closed her eyes... When we met How the bright sun shone Then love died Now the rainbow is gone Oh dear... Prussia Cove... Yet... Wait a minute... Sea cadets... And not just boys but girls as well Not just British sea cadets but Australian New Zealander Canadian... Oh Oh my... Number 98 Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps... The Crown actually allowed the sea youth service of the oldest of the Dominions to receive Royal patronage ... Then why didnt the United Kingdoms own junior sea service... Eh... Er... No. 98 Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps W... Oh my... Oh dear... This was EMBARRASSING... This unit named itself after HER... A ships bell then rang... Black black the nights Ive known Longing for you so lost and alone. Gone gone the love we knew Blue is my world since Im without you... As the hearts and fondest wishes of HUNDREDS of brave boys and girls seemed to ring through her very soul she then perked on sensing one particular lad a native of Penzance whose grandfather had actually... Oh... Ah... She understood now... Yet why on Earth... Huh... WHAT When we met How the bright sun shone Then love died Now the rainbow is gone The souls of dozens HUNDREDS of warships and yes the odd civilian ships had done WHAT Had...become HUMAN No Had become METAHUMAN... Like those mystery men and mystery women in their colourful fighting uniforms whose deeds had been prime news from North America and yes even many places in western Europe and the British Isles as well during the latter years of the Great Depression before the fifth round of the Great European FreeforAll began in 1939... Far more civilized than a tonne of those useless magicals hiding in the shadows of society since 1689 had EVER been... Love is blue now Im without you... Sensing that lovely song ending she felt herself rising noting a point in this ghostly place off to starboard turning bright such displaying an image on a cliff overlooking the final place where she had come to rest before the breakers came to end her... Love is blue now Im without you... As bosn calls shrilled the still and one cadet rang a ships bell. Well... No sense in just ignoring this... Standing and marvelling that her living spirit could now actually do things normal people men and women alike could do she moved towards that portal leading from This Place back to the mortal plane... Tene lomherbuo Charlene Victoria Boleyn... Marazion Beach three kilometres north of east from Penzance in Cornwall overlooking Saint Michaels Mount the last Wednesday of October in 2012 noon hour T≈çky≈ç time Midevening... Nothing...Bloody nothing...You sure this couldve worked...The current executive warrant officer of the combined cadet force based out of the Camborne Science and International Academy near Redruth on the Atlantic side of Cornwall from Penzance exchanged a knowing look with the coxswain of No. 98 Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps from Kitchener in southwest Ontario. I thought that Grandpa working as part of her crew would do it WOCDT John Blake just a years away from attending the Britannia Royal Naval College to follow in his familys long tradition of answering the Crowns call to become part of the Senior Service breathed out as the heads of the cadet corps who had been summoned to this place ultimately by the new Sixth Sea Lord of the Royal Navy had their charges stand easy. A lot of shipgirls did come back to duty when someone of their crew wished them to come back from wherever the kami go...CDT CPO1 Marilyn Jones of Woolwich located outside the largest city of Ontarios Waterloo Region bit her lip. Whats the special ingredient were missing then the soontobe freshman student at Wilfred Laurier University in the city of Waterloo beside Kitchener asked she hadnt contemplated a professional career in the Royal Canadian Navy even if a new stone frigate naval reserve unit HMCS Conestoga had been reestablished in nearby Cambridge. We know there are parts of the captains hull out there in the cove the breakers didnt get to all of it when they got to water level by 55.Here she waved towards Prussia Cove in emphasis. Dont the Specialized Warfare Regiment have cadet corps affiliated to it Lynne WOCDT Patrick Lowell executive warrant officer of Training Ship Leander in Auckland whose namesake served in the Mediterranean during the Second World War alongside the grand old lady herself noted as he gave Jones a hopeful look.A snort escaped the Ontarian as she gave the Aucklander a weary stare. The SWR and the old metahumans... here she made finger quotes to not mention the M term the surgeon rear admiral who organized Operation Woodpecker Hunt warned them that mentioning Britains longhidden magical population would definitely attract unwelcome attention from idiots under Northumberland Avenue in Westminster ...keep that sort of thing under their hats Pat Thanks for the haka anywayBest we could do Lynne the native of the city known to many in the Realm as TƒÅmaki Makaurau affirmed. Any ideas you can give us Lee he asked his opposite number from Training Ship Perth in the namesake capital city of Western Australia.CDTCPO Lee Shannon shook her head. Not a bloody thing mate... Tene lomherbuo Charlene Victoria Boleyn... Everyone jolted on hearing that booming malelike voice the SAME voice that heralded the return of the most famous warship of the modern era a little over two months prior in the North Atlantic westsouthwest of here echo over the scene...Damn Blake breathed out as a point of very bright light appeared in the sky overhead to the south. I think we did itImmediately the cadets all moved to straighten their ranks. PIPE THE SIDE the CCF senior cadet then barked out.One of the Canadian cadets grasped the rope tied to the small ships bell which had been set up by his British counterparts right next to the stone memorial honouring the Royal Navys most successful warship overlooking where she had finally surrendered to her fate after World War Two while bosn mates from all four countries forming a row raised their calls to their lips......just as the sounds of large sections of metal clanging against each other echoed through the local sky Somewhere under Northumberland Avenue in the City of Westminster that moment... Oh Merlins Beard...What is it JohnIts happening HERE Shack John Dawlish declared pointing.Kingsley Shacklebolt blinked before he looked......then he gaped on seeing the bright target icon appear on the map of the British Isles used by the Ministry of Magics various departments to monitor significant magical events within their area of jurisdiction.Said target icon now indicating something BIG was happening right near Lands End in CornwallAnd given what the Ministry of Magic had learned from other magical governments over the last few months...What was there the Grenadiandescent auror sergeant barked to one of the few people in this place who had gone to Canada to train at the Institute of Sorcery and Magic coming back with considerable knowledge about muggle naval affairs.Given that the crews of the eight monsterslaying magical battleships of the Dominion all trained at the end of the Sibley Peninsula where the Great Old One known as Nanabozho was rumoured to be resting...Whispering a spell the retired auror now working for the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes office of misinformation which really didnt have to do much these days when it came to THEM blinked as a ghostly parchment appeared before him. Gazing at the small list of names on said parchment which also contained a quick note concerning the final fate of warships who had sunk at or near that part of Cornwall he ran through them before gaping.His Canadian teachers all veterans of the Wars of Liberation from all eight of the Dominions great monsterslaying battleships had waxed poetic about THIS particular warships actions during BOTH world wars...Its Warspite... he then called out.Shacklebolt even if he was a pureblood he was quite the expert in muggle matters and had forced himself through a crash course on the naval side of muggle military affairs in recent months thanks to the reborn sea spirits now known as shipgirls in English worldwide blinked before he gaped as that name rang loud in his memory. The BATTLESHIPSame She ran aground there when she was en route to scrapping after Grindelwalds War ended then was SCRAPPED thereShack LookOn hearing Dawlishs shout the darkskinned auror looked at the map once more......then he grimly nodded. Her scrap metals being gathered to be reassembled... he concluded.People stared at him then turned back to morbidly watch as MANY streaks of light seemed to emanate from all over southern England and Wales to converge at the very point of interest now attracting the attention of the Ministrys magical sensors. Ill warn the Minister Dawlish then declared as he moved to leave. Hell want to know about this...Shacklebolt rolled his eyes. Do the words Magical Royal Proclamation mean something to you JohnThat made the known arsekisser to Cornelius Fudge visibly wince as he gave his superior a wary look... Near Saint Michaels Rock a minute later... Bloody HELL thats FASTItd take YEARS to rebuild her the NORMAL wayWhat the hell makes this happen anywayOnly Father Ranginui and Mother Papat≈´ƒÅnuku know that damned answer Lee...As the assembly of cadets from four Commonwealth realms watched in overwhelmed awe crowds of people streamed from nearby homes and cars who had been travelling along the West End between Marazion and Goldsithney to the east and Long Rock and Penzance to the west began to gather in the park around the simple stone memorial to Britains most successful warship drawing out cell phones and even the odd professional digital camera to take photos of the second of the Queen Elizabethclass fast superdreadnoughts literally being REBUILT while hovering in the air about a halfkilometre above the waters of Prussia Cove. While there hadnt been any police presence at this gathering given a shipgirls power the idea of someone actually WANTING to cause issues here had been waved off by the justappointed Surgeon Rear Admiral Katharine Jones when she was appointed as Sixth Sea LordCommander Naval Specialized Warfare Forces a few months ago two constables of the Devon and Cornwall Police soon drove up in their modified Ford Focus patrol car parking in the lot next to the marker set up by the HMS Warspite Association in memorial to their beloved ship next to her final mortal resting place.Soon enough both constables threaded through the crowd of excited people to find themselves facing the aftmost row of cadets now standing at divisions awaiting the arrival of their namesake ship. Excuse me Whos in charge here one called out.The four senior cadets forming a row at the head of this crowd now facing the effectively halfrebuilt HMS Warspite looked over their shoulders then the one in the recognizable uniform of the Combined Cadet Force walked between his gathered subordinates to come to attention saluting the justarrived constables. Gentlemen can we be of assistance John Blake asked.The constables returned that courtesy. When did THIS start lad one asked. Do you have any authorization for thisSmiling the native of Redruth reached into his dress jacket pocket to pull out a folded letter. From the Sixth Sea Lord with her sincerest compliments Constable he said as he handed said letter over.Taking it the two men gazed on what was written there before they blinked on seeing the written note there from the future head of the United Kingdoms shipgirl forces the surgeon from Chatham east of London had been assigned to her present post after spending two years as Director General of Defence Medical Services the first woman promoted to such a position. Look there the junior constable then stated after noting what was written in a VERY familiar scrawl over the main body of the text We desire this. La Reyne le veult. Elizabeth R Both constables chuckled as the letter was handed back. Would have been nice for someone to warn US this was happening the senior of the pair commented. Cant imagine whats happening on the A394 right now...A radio then squawked making him pick up his portable set to answer his dispatcher over in Penzance. First time this is happening WOCDT Blake explained. She was picked first since shes the most prominent of all Royal Navy ships from the second goaround with the Germans. Here the handsome Kenyandescent senior sea cadet indicated the rebuilding Warspite which was now effectively complete to her upper weather deck the eight 15 inch BL Mark I main cannon among whose number one of the longest shots by a naval rifle had been fired on 9 July 1940 during the Battle of Calabria due east of Sicily such a blow hitting RM Giulio Cesare in the aft funnel awaiting their chances to be inserted into reassembling gun houses.The constable nodded. And with Bismarck returned to duty thanks to that whole damned thing with the Marvel universe back in August with a load of Uboats and minor ships finally following her without defecting to Canada of all places...Aye sir...ITS HAPPENINGBoth men looked up to see Warspite now effectively complete the whole hull moving to glow star bright none of the witnesses on this at ground level could see the very tiny point of light marking the true special ingredient CDT CPO1 Marilyn Jones from the battleships namesake sea cadet corps asked about when the assembled cadets moved to begin this summoning exercise.EVERYONE COVER YOUR EYES DONT LOOK AT HER the constable barked after yanking out a megaphone.As people turned away or shielded their eyes from the most magical part of this whole evolution the reassembled mass of 33110 tonnes of steel regenerated wood and other elements that had gone in to make the second Queen Elizabethclass fast dreadnought what she was then collapsed into a ball of raw power glowing with the upfront effect of a noonday Sun... Nesu...RIMKUTI Silence fell......before the ground suddenly quaked as something humansized in dimensions came down about a couple metres away from the assembled cadets nearly knocking down the row of bosn mates ready to call the still and announce the reborn Warspites arrival.Fortunately even if her justtransformed new hull was adjusting to human dimensions including body mass the woman now being hailed elsewhere as the Lucky Woodpecker of Battle Rimkuti Warspite hadnt hurt anyone with her landing.People blinked before a melodic West Country accent called out Oh dreadfully sorry Didnt mean to trip anyone upEveryone moved to look......they then beholding the transformed and reborn Charlene Boleyn standing there in her forest green martial arts gilike uniform. Such was a design common to shipgirls born of Great Warera ships as well as cultural traditionalists like a certain Japanese aircraft carrier who missed out on the whole Second World War until her transformation at the start of April this year. Charlene also possessed gold belt and boots her ships crest with its gold Elizabethan Era cannon on a green field over her heart and the pennant 57 her original Great War hull number the gathered Sea Cadets knew the pennant 03 which Warspite used in World War Two had been assigned in the previous war to the light cruiser HMS Weymouth name ship of her subseries of the wellregarded Townclass cruisers in whitebordered black on her upper thighs. Atop that said costume was decorated liberally with frolicking European green woodpeckers trimmed in soft grey dancing gaily all over the darker green background.Bloody hell Shes a damned LOOKER that one one young man hissed from the assembled civilians nearby.Perking as she tried NOT to blush at such a compliment she really needed to see a mirror for Gods sake the reborn battleship then jolted as who appeared to be the senior British cadet present called out PIPE THE SIDEAll the cadets snapped to attention as the bosn mate manning the bell rang it twice to announce the arrival of a senior officer. In response the adopted native of Devonport in Hampshire where she was personally built and Deptford on the south bank of the Thames within the modern London borough of Lewisham where the first ship named Warspite had been built to serve the navy of the original Queen Elizabeth and her successive monarchs Kings James VII and Charles I immediately snapped to attention and saluted the unofficial brow she noting she had the four rings with Elliots Eye on the top of a captain in the Royal Navy on her sleeve cuffs. WARSPITE ARRIVING the quartermaster of the watch beside the line of bosn mates called out saluting.A minute pause followed then the twotone notes of the carry on was piped then by the bosn mates off to her port. Then the senior British cadet a transplanted colonial from Africa somewhere by the looks of him approached her. Captain Boleyn welcome back maam the fellow whose rank insignia composed of the Arms of Dominion in red thread something Charlene couldnt recognize now greeted her after giving her a salute which she returned. Cadet Warrant Officer John Blake executive warrant officer of the Combined Cadet Force unit at the Camborne Science and International Academy in Redruth commander of Task Group W assigned to complete Operation Woodpecker Hunt reporting with personnel from my corps Number 98 Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps Warspite of Kitchener in Ontario Training Ship Perth of Perth in Western Australia and Training Ship Leander of Devonport in Auckland ready for your inspection and postsalvage briefing.The blonde blueeyed battleship took that in then she sighed lowering her arm. I assume theres a reason not just myself but hundreds like me worldwide are being salvaged and transformed into this she wondered waving to herself.WOCDT Blake smiled as he reached into his pocket to draw out a formal envelope such sealed with red wax with a VERY familiar sigil keeping it closed. From Her Majesty with her sincere complements maam.Her blue eyes went wide before she took up the letter then snapped it open revealing one folded sheet of paper. I know the King passed away while I was being scrapped here so I assume his daughter is the current Queen...Has been since 1952 maam Blake assured her. Its Halloween day in 2012 now maam.Very good Warrant she noted as she opened the folded letter. She then smiled in delight as the lady with the Arms of Canada as her rank insignia and the ships crest Charlene bore over her heart on her uniform jacket came up offering her hand. I assume youre a warrant officer as well Miss Jones she wondered noting the newcomers name tag under her corps badge.Chief Petty Officer First Class maam CDT CPO1 Marilyn Jones answered as she took the empty envelope in hand. Warrants in Canada are Army and Air Force and Army Cadet and Air Cadet rank titles. We dont mix them as they do here in old Blighty much less Down Under. Here she winked at her counterparts from TS Leander and TS Perth.Both CDTCPO Lee Shannon and WOCDT Patrick Lowell laughed at that comment. Leander and Perth eh Charlene then mused. Good ships both of them. Heard that old Leander went to New Zealand has she come back this wayBoth of our namesake ships maam Shannon answered. Perth is Captain Helen Farncomb...And Leander is Captain Wendy RivettCarnac Captain Lowell added before calling out Petty Officer DysonAyeaye Warrant a woman with the crossed anchors and crown of a cadet petty officer in the New Zealand Sea Cadet Corps called back taking one step forward from the ranks and saluting the reborn battleship with she returned with a nod.Send an email to Captain RivettCarnac and Captain Farncomb to inform them of the captains returnAyeaye Warrant POCDT Lois Dyson said before reaching into her jacket to draw out what looked like a slate of glass and metal the size of a pocketbook novel to the adopted native of Devonport.Blinking as she THEN realized there was something tucked away in her new uniform belt pouch on her right starboard hip she then switched the letter from Buckingham Palace to her left hand to reach for whatever was there.Um maam Blake called out. Before you pull that out you best read that part.Noting he was pointing to the letter Charlene blinked before looking over noting one paragraph all in bold print Charlene please do NOT openly speak of where your new hull comes from. As to the why youll be briefed on as soon as youre in a secure place by your new admiral. The safety of Earth as a whole depends on your silence Humming in understanding as she nodded thanks to Blake the four senior cadets in charge of this operation had been given a more thorough briefing about how shipgirls became what they were and WHY such had to be kept secret from the general public given a certain situation occurring now just outside T≈çky≈ç in Japan she turned back to read the Queens letter in full......before her cheeks reddened as her empty stomach suddenly and LOUDLY creakedSilence.More silence.Still more silence.Then...Rations Jones proposed.Too early for tea time Marilyn Shannon advised.Charlene gaped. Too early for TEA Tosh Go get some food summoned up ChiefThe native of Woolwich smartly saluted her. Ayeaye maam In the city of Westminster the headquarters complex of the Ministry of Magic under Northumberland Avenue near Whitehall a halfhour later... A shipgirlYes Minister.A BRITISH shipgirlHMS Warspite one of the Great War battleships Minister. She was at Second Dogger Bank.Cornelius Fudge looked as pale as a ghost as he took a moment to absorb that blasting hex just delivered to him by John Dawlish and Kingsley Shacklebolt. Also in his office with the two aurors were Dawlishs and Shacklebolts top superior Director Amelia Bones chief auror Rufus Scrimgeour Fudges new junior undersecretary Percy Weasley...and much to Bones Scrimgeours and Shacklebolts personal annoyance Lucius Malfoy given that Dolores Umbridge was currently working at Hogwarts as this school terms yearly sacrifice she was currently in Scotland. Oh dear Merlin... the current Baron of Cotswold who had been elected as Minister for Magic which he and many others like him often mistakenly called minister OF magic forgetting that the official title had been imposed by Royal Warrant in 1707 with the reorganization of the governing body for British magicals as a compromise between light and dark factions in the Wizengamot could only breathe out. While the news of the reborn firstgeneration battle dolls from the third world of Kaeyu having merged with the literally kami of sea warships that had been occurring over many parts of Earth had been in general magical public circulation since the soul of the destroyer Fubuki became Fukushima Fujiko in midMarch the Daily Prophet and most of the other major newspapers and magazines serving wizarding Britain had been encouraged to downplay such incidents even after the shocking return of the legendary German battleship Bismarck in the personage of Luisa von BismarckSch√∂nhausen a little over two months ago.But with a BRITISH warship having been changed that way...We must find a way to subvert these creatures to protect ourselves Cornelius Malfoy then warned.We cant Lord Malfoy Weasley then spoke up making the proshipgirl magicals in the room all save Dawlish who was a fencesitter when it came to the existence of such beings perk at the junior undersecretarys words. Her Majesty the Queen has issued a Magical Royal Proclamation forbidding Ministry interference when it comes to ANY shipgirl especially if they come from the United Kingdom or any of the Commonwealth realms or the muggle governments allies in this NATO alliance. Master Mycroft Holmes will be in overall charge of them in his place as leader of the Specialized Warfare Fencibles.Hearing THAT mans name made the Marquess of Avebury based out of the heart of Wiltshire openly wince as Bones and Scrimgeour exchanged knowing looks and Shacklebolt hid his own smile. Given that both laws passed by the muggle Parliament at the Palace of Westminster upriver from the MoMs headquarters complex and magical royal proclamations the latter being the supreme law for all magicals in the United Kingdom no matter how much traditionalists sometimes loudly wished otherwise had been in effect since Grindelwalds War ended in 1945 to prevent magicals from interfering with nonmagical metahumans the fact that a man like Mycroft Holmes had such control over such people made those like Fudge quake in their boots they hoping NOTHING would happen that would force the mans hand against people such as they. Given Malfoys true affiliations as a certain tattoo on the mans inner left arm loudly declared he always wearing clothes to hide the Dark Mark from public view the fact that MUGGLES had such power over MAGICALS was something he hated with all his being.Such a view was shared by a certain dark lord and his other followers who had managed to pull off a spectacular prison break earlier this morning at Azkaban in the North Sea east of the Shetland Islands...That alone made Fudges day VERY bad much to Malfoys private delightBut to have something like THIS drop down on peoples heads at the same time...There has to be a way around this Mister Weatherby Malfoy then snarled.Weasleys eyes flashed his annoyance at the mispronunciation of his family name. Yes there was the longstanding feud between the Malfoys of Avebury and the Weasleys of Ottery Saint Catchpole but Weasleys decision to not follow his familys mad drive to warn people that He Who Must Never Be Named had somehow returned back in late May should have earned him respect with darker factions in both the Ministry and the Wizengamot. There is NO way around this Lord Malfoy. Mister Holmes is FAR smarter than that and weve NO idea if Lady Warspite is actually the FIRST shipgirl of the United Kingdom to have returned to duty in this particular manner. As Fudge gargled in disbelief he added Many warships of the Royal Navy were lost overseas during both the Great War and the Wars of Liberation the chances are good that a shipgirl born from a vessel sunk in the Mediterranean Sea the Indian Ocean or the Pacific Ocean basins could have come back earlier. Given how much Lady Saeru gets around on her weekend or holiday trips around the world thanks to Professor Thomas floating umbrella...She has to be stopped from doing that Malfoy snapped. Cornelius you HAVE to make a firm stand hereIf youre that hellbound to be BEHEADED by Lady Yonaga of all people Lucius please go right on ahead Bones teased making Voldemorts chief financier turn as white as a ghost the news of THAT particular shipgirl and what she and her stillliving crew had been doing in the hinterland of Siberia for over seven decades started getting around back in late April.Amelia please Fudge urged. Theres no time for that...A rapid knocking was heard at the door. MinisterSaid minister looked over. What WhatThe door flew open to reveal another auror he quite wideeyed. Minister a whole SLEW of shipgirls appear to be coming back Scapa Flow both IN the bay and outside it not to mention the English Channel and elsewhere...As peoples jaws dropped Malfoy sneered as he HOPED that his master was monitoring things through the Dark Mark.What happened on Monday night in Whitby couldnt be allowed to happen AGAIN... The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the mountains of Perth and Kinross in Scotland that moment... Oh dear...Hearing that mused statement from her prize preNEWT student Professor Sybil Trelawney looked over. What is itThe woman that the greatgranddaughter of Britains most famous Seer knew was ALSO a Gifted adopted Yizibajohei and who knew the TRUE fate of the Boy Who Lived even if she was sworn to total secrecy over that matter looked up from her crystal ball it now displaying the image of a smiling blueeyed blonde twentysomething being walked into a fish and chips restaurant somewhere in the United Kingdom by equallysmiling uniformed youth everyone chattering away as many bystanders went and took pictures. The badge over her heart loudly declared who she had once been. Britains first shipgirl.Trelawney came over to gaze on her then nodded. Warspite. Queen Elizabethclass battleship veteran of Second Dogger Bank on the muggle side of things she declared her voice exceptionally clear both Hirosaki Chikage and Luna Lovegood had been on the older womans case to stop drinking so much when she was in class especially now with a certain pureblood senior undersecretary who violated the tenets of Hogwarts bylaws by working here while STILL being employed by the Ministry of Magic causing too much in the way of disruption especially among students in the Defence Against the Dark Arts classes. Most decorated warship of the Royal Navy as I recall you telling me when I asked about your sister potentially bringing back Her Majestys warships as shipgirls thanks to the largess of the Healer of Destruction. Was Hinako involvedNo shell be preparing for bed right now Professor Hirosaki Chikage advised. She only goes on shipgirl hunts on the weekends when she can spare time from friends and homework. I dont recall Mycroft asking for her help in finding warship kami to see salvaged and Gifted to serve under Surgeon Rear Admiral Jones new command. Here the Dark Heart of Pure Chaos Nosyoorbem Dragonheart took a sip of some welcome tea she didnt have any classes for the rest of today so she was spending time with Trelawney helping tutor junior students in divination. Oh Pansy we need Dolores floo portal blocked for the rest of today. Her dear Cornelius might be persuaded by Dracos father to move directly against Charlene and whoever else might be summoned back to duty once they sense her Giftings happened. No doubt Tom might take offence.The very shadows of the divination classroom seemed to stir at that statement from the native of the magical side of T≈çky≈ç who had some VERY powerful relations...including the manturnedwoman who saved Pansy Parkinsons life years ago thus seeing the daughter of the current Earl of Keerford in Lancashire eventually Gifted as the Shadow Hunter Semtato Silhouette.Done Chikage the darkhaired realityshadow warper called back telepathically from the Great Hall. Whats going onMycroft is getting a very nice Halloween present the highlevel archmage sorceress replied.Oh thats nice... Scapa Flow within the Orkney Islands north of John o Groats at the northernmost tip of Scotland that moment... A fisherman busy moving to get some fresh catch from the waters of the old wartime fleet anchorage perked as the very calm waves off to the north and west of his current position began to churn wildly... Tene lomherbuo Jocelyn Daphne Dick.... Tene lomherbuo Kimberly Rachel Maclachlan... Turning to look as the waters over the wreck sites of the first of the Revengeclass superdreadnoughts and the last of the Saint Vincentclass firstgeneration dreadnoughts as seen by launch date had been sunk he then cackled in delight as streaks of energy flew across the sky from the south to see salvaged fittings and other parts of either HMS Royal Oak or HMS Vanguard fly into place ready to reunite with the remainder of the hulls now rising from the Flow. Ruddy about time... Tene lomherbuo Marie Charlotte mu W√ºrttemberg... Tene lomherbuo Catharine Ottilie mu Z√§hringen... Tene lomherbuo Augusta Victoria mu Preu√üen...

Bloody hell Even the German ships too the fisherman exclaimed before another delighted laugh escaped him.Noting that the very hull of Royal Oak was now surfacing off to the north he then shrugged as he sat back in his chair setting aside his fishing pole as he moved to pull out a camera to get some decent pictures.He wasnt going to miss THIS for the whole damned world To Be Continued...

The Great Old Ones as a whole were first mentioned in Part Three of Magic and Canada.The phrase Great European FreeforAll to identify a continentwide war was coined by Shaithan in his very funny KanColle short story Germany Cannot Into Navy which is listed in the Kantai Collection Fanfic Idea and Recs snippet collection at Space Battles post 24076928. According to him the various iterations of the GEFFA are as followsFirst round The Thirty Years War 16181648 Second round The Seven Years War 17561763 Third round The Napoleonic Wars 18031815 Fourth round The First World War AKA the Great War 19141918 Fifth round The Second World War 19391945Surgeon Rear Admiral Katharine Jones was first introduced in the universe of this story in Part 35 of BmGmM she first appeared in The Seventh Shipgirl. As a doctor she is accorded the surgeon title prefix to her rank such is shortformed Surg RAdm. As noted before she was selected to the position of Sixth Sea LordCommander Naval Specialized Warfare Forces 6SLCOMNSWF due to her also possessing a doctorate degree in psychology atop her combined bachelors degree in medicine and surgery this would help her better deal with all forms of shipgirl insanity. As an aside there has never been a Sixth Sea Lord in the Royal Navy in real life the First Sea Lord 1SL is the professional head of the senior service the Second Sea Lord 2SL is the administrative deputy commander of the Royal Navy the Third Sea Lord 3SL was the chief of equipment procurementmanagement the Fourth Sea Lord 4SL was in charge of all naval supply issues and the Fifth Sea Lord 5SL was chief of naval aviation services. Note that the titles for the Third Fourth and Fifth Sea Lords were effectively discontinued by 1965 in real life they were revised in the universe of my stories after shipgirls began to appear.The Second Battle of Dogger Bank is the magical name for the Battle of Jutland on 31 May1 June 1916. The involvement of magicals from Canada in that fight is described better in Part Seven of Magic and Canada.Mycroft Holmes from the BBC Sherlock television series first produced in 2010 is the Master of the Royal Specialized Warfare Fencibles he was first mentioned in this series in Part 11 of BmGmM. A fencible regiment from the term defensible was a home defence unit created by the British Army during the era of the Napoleonic Wars to act as its title states it should such a unit is NEVER meant for duties away from the homeland. The Royal Specialized Warfare Fencibles RSWF was authorized by the Crown in the Specialized Warfare Act 1949 which codified all rights and responsibilities for metahumans in the United Kingdom this would bring together all metahuman military personnel in emergencies. Given he IS the British Government according to his brother Sherlock Holmes Mycrofts taking command of the RSWF both in peacetime and war makes sense.As for the shipgirls introduced here safe for who was being Gifted in the final scene such will be noted in the following part starting with the Commonwealth realmsCaptain Charlene Victoria Boleyn RN HisHer Majestys Ship Warspite pennant 57 formerly pennant 03 Captain Helen Louisa Farncomb RAN HisHer Majestys Australian Ship Perth CL20 formerly pennant D29 formerly His Majestys Ship Amphion administrative pennant C29 Captain Julia Wendy RivettCarnac RNZN HisHer Majestys New Zealand Ship Leander pennant C72 formerly pennant 75 formerly His Majestys Ship Leander administrative pennant C75Charlene Boleyn HMS Warspite and Helen Farncomb HMAS Perth both take after their Kantai Collection selves. Wendy RivettCarnac HMNZS Leander resembles her Azur Lane interpretation. Note that pennant numbers in the Royal Navy due to their being reused during the world wars and afterwards were reorganized into a single list this is the reason Charlene went back to her original Great War pennant number. The Royal New Zealand Navy makes use of the same type of system note that in both the RNZN and the RN pennant superior letter C indicates a cruiser. The Royal Australian Navy used pennant numbers until the Vietnam War when it switched to the American hull classification code system the code CL means light cruiser. Also note that during the World Wars the Commonwealth realms did not use a typespecific pennant superior system hence the reason Helen got pennant D29 pennant superior letter D in the RN and RNZN these days indicates a destroyer.Note that all Britishbuilt warships are given an administrative pennant number if theyre transferred overseas.A quick note about the ship who originally had pennant 03 in the Great War...Captain Evelyn Vanna Underhill RN HisHer Majestys Ship Weymouth pennant C163 formerly pennant 03As I strongly doubt that games such as KanColle will ever get around to introducing shipgirl versions of Great War warships there is no physical lookalike to Vanna Underhill HMS Weymouth I can personally reference to. As for cruiser pennant numbers ships from World War Two get first pick of allotments usually their old pennant number with the C superior then Great War vessels would fill in remaining numbers from 0099 except 13 naturally before going into higher numbers then anything commissioned prior to 1914 who was either directly active or had sisters active during that particular conflict.The opponents from the Battle of the Denmark Strait on 24 May 1941...Captain Mary Sonia Hood RN HisHer Majestys Ship Hood pennant 51 Kapit√§n zur See Wilhelmina Luisa F√ºrstin von BismarckSch√∂nhausen KMDR Kriegsmarineschiff Bismarck pennant 62Luisa von Bismarck KMS Bismarck takes after her KanColle self. Mary Hood HMS Hood takes after her Azur Lane interpretation. Note that the German Navy the service code here is KMDR for Kriegsmarine der Deutschen Reiches War Navy of the German Realm never used pennant numbers for anything above a destroyer in the Second World War the pennant 62 indicates Luisa is the sixtysecond battleship built in Germany. Like in Britain and elsewhere in Europe capital ships do not receive a pennant superior letter. Being what she is and who she was named after Luisa receives the honorary rank of Kapit√§n zur See Captain At Sea shortformed KptzS and the noble honorific F√ºrstin normally translated as princess.Finally the two Japanese shipgirls mentioned here are better explained in Part One of BmGmM.,Teen And Up Audiences,Not Found
https://archiveofourown.org/works/29949861,Chapters to Requested Poll works and my Fanfic Ideas,Harry povHarry was running running as fast as he could it was the one thing he was good at.Running away from his cousin Dudley and his mean friends. Clutching his brown lunch given to him by his teacher when she realized he was the only kid at the schools picnic that didnt have one. Harry was scared of loosing the first meal he had in days so he kept running deeper into the forest the sound of Dudley and the others falling behind.Harry quickly looked behind him and that proved to be a mistake as he didnt see the sudden dip of the ground that led to a cliff. Harry cried out as he fell and tumbled before hitting his head and losing consciousness. 1856 Kentucky Harrys head hurt his whole body hurt as he slowly sat up biting his lip so no noise escaped except for a few tears. Harry sat up and looked around he was still in the woods but they looked more different more Wild. Warning minor violence ahead. Harry carefully looked around the tree he was leaning against and saw a huge farm full of people wearing rags like him that had dark skin working. Harry suddenly saw one of the men who was walking around hit a man with some weird rope in his hand.The dark skinned man cried out in pain as the other man yelled at him to get back to work. Harry now horrified and scared flinched and let out a sob when the rope cracked out again.The white men were bad just like his uncle Vernon. Harry peaked out from behind his tree lunch still clutched in his hands and thought please dont let the bad men see me please dont see me . Harry was not stupid he knew that when he wished for things they usually happened for some reason.Harry sighed in relief as the mean men with ropes eyes passed over him as if he werent there this is how he noticed that there wasnt any cars on the road that was past the farm. Only wagons full of hay even the street lights looked weird how the people talked was weird and thats when harry realized he wasnt in Surrey anymore.Carefully Harry went around the edge of the forest looking for a way out when he came across a woman that was working in the fields her eyes were green kind of like his and her skin was lighter than the other workers. She had a small baby on her back that was asleep and for some reason he couldnt look away from them. Harry was brought out of his musings when the women stumbled and fell over.Concerned Harry ran out to her and wishing that they were hidden by the long plants and pulled the toddler out from under her so she wasnt crushing her. The little girls face scrunched up and panicking harry got into his lunch and opened his string cheese shoved it in her mouth so she wouldnt cry. the girl stared before starting to suckchew on the food given to her.Harry heard one of the mean men shouting and knew they were looking for the woman with green eyes he took his water bottle out of his bag and tapped the ladies cheek.maam please you have to wake up maam Her eyes slid open but fell closed again Harry put his water bottle up to her mouth and poured it slowly so she wouldnt choke.He had gotten heat stroke before when his Aunt Petunia had forced him to work in the garden one summer without water. Harry heard the bad men get closer and wished very hard she would wake up fear filling him at being caught an beaten when the lady gasped sat up and swallowed down the rest of the water.Mission accomplished Harry took his water bottle back and ran as fast as he could back to the woods with his lunch just as the bad men found the lady Harry wished very hard that she wouldnt get in trouble and she didnt. Little did Harry know that he had gained a friend as he waved at her from behind his tree prior to disappearing in the woods. Two months Later Harry had been living in a cave part time by the farm for a while now he had a dog called Bane that was a stray he had found injured by a river a few weeks ago. After being wished better Bane helped Harry by showing him what to eat and what not to eat. Harry also got food from his ma who had eventually confronted him asking why he was helping her and the other slaves.As sometimes when would wish the bad men away wish them better when they got sick. On top of bringing them food that tasted way better then the gruel they were used to eating. She found out he came from far away and used to be a slave too. Eventually she let him sleep with Her and her daughter Anna some nights and told him lots of stories and about Kentucky where they lived.He couldnt stay in mas cabin all the time with her because he would have been found by the mean people and taken away Ma had said. Because every now and then the cabins were searched by the mean men on massa Vadomas orders.As time passed Harrys hand me down clothes from his cousin had gotten torn so he had to rip the bottom of his pants off to use as shoes as he had lost his. His shirt was tied over one shoulder looking like a large pillow case and his jacket was often used as a belt to keep his shorts up or as a blanket since it was so big.Today Bane had led him to a big bush of blackberriesExcited Harry picked as many as he could feeding some to bane who gobbled them up as quick as he could. After determining he had enough for Ma and Anna he wrapped them up in his jacket and took off. When he reached mas cabin he knew something was wrong because she wasnt there.Harry calmed himself down by thinking maybe she was still at the field so he ran down to the field with bane on his heels but when he got there she wasnt there either only old man Dan was left in the field and looked at him in pity.hello old man Dan do you know where my ma is harry said running up to the man that had been like his grandfather harry felt his throat close when he saw Dans eyes fill with tears. I am a sorry boy ya ma is being sold far down south it ain right but massa been sellin lossa of us more of us are just coming up missin...son I suggest ya get outta here if you have any sense. old Dan said but harry had heard enough droping the blackberries harry ran in the direction of the gates hoping to catch his ma no his mother and save her and head north like she was always telling him about.Harry ran as fast as he could his legs burning but he pushed himself harder Bane running ahead of him growling as they finally arrived by the gates where his ma was creaming as the bad men took anna away and shoved her toward the cart to be chained. along with the other slaves that were sobbing and crying out in a rising cacophony.Enraged harry screamed at them LET MY MOMMA GO. his magic lashed out and struck the man holding Anna who flew into the thicket of trees behind him with a sick crunching noise.The other man pulled out his whip and gun but harry looked at him and wished with all his heart that the man was dead the man fell to his knees clutching his chest as harrys ma ran to anna and picked her up from the ground.Harry ran into her arms and hugged her tight careful of her back that was obviously injured as she held him close and kissed his cheeks. Green eyes my child what are ya doin here.Momma Im settin you free I gots a boat at the river we can use to head north but we gotta go. harry said already pulling his mom by her arm as shouts of others came closer probably hearing the commotion.Ma nodded and looked sadly to the slaves still in the cart asking to be let out harry getting a idea wished them free and they all scattered except for a young boy around Harrys age that followed them.They ran past the cabins past the plantation and into the woods Harry took Anna from his Ma who was struggling to keep up due to her wounds. They had finally reached the river as the sun was falling and Harry felt something was off the woods were too quiet no sound of searching dogs or tweeting birds. Everyone was tired and hurt from running over the forest ground. Harry wished that they wouldnt be found or caught as hard as he could.Harry walked faster pushing the group harder until they reached the boat when Bane started to bark at the trees aggressively. Harry turned around just as something monstrous with fangs leapt out from the tree tops only to get attacked by Bane. Harry cried out as the dog was kicked away into a tree and didnt get up again overcome with loss harry screamed at the man just wanting them all to go away. Harry closed his eyes and curled into a ball when the monster started to scream ignoring his mas calls to get on the boat that was already drifting down the river.When the screaming stopped Harry opened his eyes and there was nothing there so he ran over to Bane and with some maneuvering put him on his back and ran After his ma anna and the other boy. There was a stone outcropping that he could use to jump onto the raft his Ma saying over and over again that he could make it. Harry jumped but before he could land on the raft He saw his Mas face turn to a look of horror.Harry was harshly jerked back onto land by a harsh grip on his back fear so strong that it made his head spin filled him. Harry fought and struggled to get away when he was hit on the back of the head. Losing consciousness harry wished as hard as he could that his Ma and the others would get away a mans voice whispering in his ear going unheard.Adam was enjoying a random after noon reading the paper and making plans to stop Abraham from winning the next electoral senator seat when one of his men burst into the room.Vadoma raised her eyebrow as they looked at the intruder what is it now hmmm has Abraham killed another vampire the man shook his head and Adam feeling his patience thin snapped out Then what else is the problem important enough to interrupt our evening Well speak Sorry sir but there had been an incident at one of lady Vadomas plantations theres reports of one of our kind being killed by a child..and well many are claiming that it was due to witch craft.Adam was now interested Witchcraft you say tell me what happened in detail Vadoma come let us go to the plantation and see who this child is. Adam said motioned for the man to keep speaking as they left the Mansion. well sir we have already questioned some of the remaining slaves as to what happened. And they told us that a green eyed child that came from the woods protected them with his magic and that he was close to a half breed slave claimed to be his mother. Thats why the boy helped her escape. The man explained nervously to them as they rode down to the plantation. Adam hummed as he thought about what he was told he remembered that long ago when he was in Egypt that there once was a line of sorcerers greatly coveted by the Pharaohs until they died out.They were often recognized by their eyes that were said to glow green and Adam felt his excitement grow for if they could find this magic user and get him on their side they would be nigh unstoppable.It didnt take long to reach the gates where they found Bert who was impaled through the heart by a tree Adam shook his head at the sight before looking for the half breeds scent.Vadoma found it and they quickly followed it all the way northeast near the river where they found a group of slaves and a wild white child attempting to escape by boat.Adam held up his hand stopping his sister and lackey from attacking the group as he studied the child he was wearing rags worse than those belonging to the slaves and he was skinny as if he hadnt been fed well.His long wild hair cupping his face as he looked around as if he sensed them and his eyes lord his eyes were green so emerald they but gems to shame.Curious Adam ordered his man to attack the group to see if the child could actually perform magic so when the boy turned his liuetenet to dust with nothing but a wave of the hand he was sold. His sister looked shaken by the Childs power before her eyes narrowed in thought.Adam told her to return home while he grabbed their new guest she nodded and quickly left to prepare for the child as commanded.It wasnt until the boy turned around while carrying the mutt that Adam saw it the dark mark sitting on the boys shoulder that clearly spelled out his name.Immediately all thought of using the boy was thrown out the proverbial window.This child the one he had been sorely waiting for belonged to him. Adams fangs lengthened as he left down from the tree after his life mate who was attempting to escape him by jumping onto the puny raft.Adam felt such joy as he grabbed his mate pulling the pretty boy into his arms after tossing the mutt that was upon his back onto the floor.His mate started to fight him tutting as this would not do as their first meetingAdam sighed before knocking his love unconscious.Worry not young one you are mine now. Adam whispered lovingly into the childs ear as he went limp bringing the boy closer so he could breathe in his scent. His eyes still dark as he was consumed by the smell of his mate that reminded him of honey cakes and the nile that Adam did not notice the raft had dissapeared down the river.Holding a sobbing woman who could only watch her child be snatched by a devil with fangs and the eyes of a night sky holding no stars.Comforting her Anna and the scared little boy she swore that she would come back for for her green eyed boy if it was the last thing she did.Adam leisurely paced outside of the door that held his mate and physician the only indicator of his inner turmoil was his eyes. That were dark and full of rage.When Adam arrived to his Manor he brought his unconscious mate to his wing to the room attached to his own by a doorway.Meant for the mistress of the house to live in that has been unused until now.for his maid Mary Belle to bathe and take care of.He heard his mate Harry break down as Mary Belle explained in a little white lie how Adam found him unconscious by the river and saved him from a bad man by bringing him back to the manor.Adam tuned the rest of the conversation out as he focused on his paper work that needed to be completed.Only for Mary Belle to come to his office in a panic telling him her new master was injured having seen wounds on his skin as she bathed him.And that Harry was under the impression that he was a slave. Adam heard static as his blood roared in his undead veins he ordered Vadoma to bring him all the human overseers from the plantation Harry was found escaping from.When they arrived Adam killed them so brutally all that was left was smears of blood and gore around the room.As the vampire overseers were taken care of by Vadoma who wanted her own pound of flesh in revenge for her new brotherinlaw.Vadoma understood her Brothers anger if she had found out her mate had been abused or treated as a slave she would hunt the perpetrators who even dared to the end of the earth before torturing them to the end of their days.She grabbed her brothers arm and uncharacteristically pulled him into a hug .Do not fret brother we are aware of your mates condition so we will fix it before his state can worsen. she assured him I know but it pains me that he went through such things I hadnt noticed his wounds as I brought him back it enrages me to the point of madness. Adam admitted The physician entered the lavish waiting room interrupting their conversation. How is he Adam demanded as the doctor took off his glasses and sighed .The most worrying is he is obviously malnourished severely to the point of starvation. There is also the obvious signs of beatings with a belt and blunt objects. I also noticed that he may have had some past head trauma that has effected his eye sight. His behavior heavily indicates that he was mistreated by family members who treated him as a slave so you must be gentle with him. The doctor stressed clinically and pulled out a sheet of paper.Adam in his rage crushed the glass he held in his hand as the doctor continued on like nothing had happened. Here is a diet plan I have created for him you must not stray from it as the consequences are detrimental. I have already cleaned and dressed his remaining wounds and bruises however there isnt much I can do for his eyesight except to give him a tonic that is high in vitamin A E and C. He said handing Adam the parchment Adam accepted the parchment and thanked the human doctor. Vadoma showing the man out of the mansion as he went into his mates chambers.Adam found his mate curled up onto his side on the bed tear tracks covering his pale cheeks.Adam felt a pang of guilt at his mates sadness knowing that it had to do with the half breed he had been calling for since he had awakened in the manor.The boy scrambled back in fear after Adam shut the door and his guilt multiplied with a hint of sadness before he shoved it down. The mutt that Harry was so attached to called Bane sat up and growled. Shhhh little one dont be afraid Harry I am not going to hurt you. He said warmly and sat at the edge of the bed showing that he meant no harm.Wishing he had killed the now pampered mutt when he had the chance.Harry looked confused his eyes squinting as he wobbled out Who are you Where is my mama. More tears falling as his voice cracked at the end of his sentence. My name is Adam and I am your soulmate. I dont know where your Mother is. But I promise you that I will search for her. He said leaning over slowly to wipe the salty tears.And Adam wasnt lying he just wouldnt search very hard it wouldnt do to have anyone in Harrys ear except for himself. Harry still flinched but didnt back away as he asked Promise that you wont hurt her it wasnt her fault that we was a runnin. I know I know Harry and I promise that no harm will come to her or her child. You are my responsibility now and I want you to be happy and healthy. Adam soothed Harrys crying slowly tampering off as a result.They were interrupted by a maid bringing in Harrys specifically made dinner that consisted of a light soup that held vegetables and meat. Along with cheese bread and milk on the side.The dog getting prime steak for dinner in a bowl alongside the wall next to his water and bed.The maid Mary Belle bowed placing the meal by Adam and quickly leaving.Adam patted the empty spot next to him and waited patiently as Harry hesitated.Eventually he crawled over convinced by Adams warm smile and how nice he had been to him.Harry was soon pulled into Adams lap as the vampire asked while you eat would you like me to tell you a story Harry nodded shyly looking at the food wide eyed and looked to Adam as if for permission. Adam felt the familiar burn of wrath well up as he nodded Go ahead eat if you still hunger I will call for more food. Anything you require just let me or Mary Belle know alright dear Ok Harry said quietly as he reached for the bred and began to nibble on it.Adam new it would take time to build up trust with his mate it was a good thing he had all the time in the world .Adam began to relive his days as a boy in Egypt as Harry ate his eyes glimmering at the imaginary sights of the pyramids and how the hot sun and sand would feel on his skin.For some reason Adam had a wave a deja vu that was quickly swept away as he noticed the longing expression on his Harrys face.One day in the future I will show you my home land and all of its wonders. he divulged and seeing his mate smile for the first time was worth it. Harry eventually fell asleep against Adam after eating his fill a small bump on his stomach attesting how much he truly ate.Bane curled up next to him on the bed still watching Adam cautiously. Adam tucked his mate under the covers with a kiss to his forehead when he got a glimpse of Harrys other soulmate mark that read Henry Sturges. It was as if God was mocking him.Adam pulled Harrys sleeve back down and left the room.He wouldnt let Harry go to anyone especially not to Henry Sturges.

Somewhere... What is this What is happening... Those were the first thoughts to cross the mind of the woman born as Kleop√°tra VII Philop√°t≈çr on regaining consciousness finding herself in a strange chamber with a seethrough cover that withing a darkened hall built of a mysterious metal she couldnt recognize. Considering that she then wondered why she hadnt slipped into the realms of Hades after all she gladly allowed a poisonous asp to bite her so she could join her beloved Marcus Antonius in the next life he having killed himself in the wake of his defeat at the hands of Gaius Octavius near √Åktion. Yet the vast space outside the coffinlike object she was lying in didnt seem like any version of the fields of ƒíl√Ωsion she understood.A strange hissing noise then made the last monarch of the final dynasty that ruled ancient Egypt for centuries tense before she blinked as she felt the clear hard material keeping her within this sarcophaguslike construct lift away allowing a fresh breeze to flood her nostrils. Hesitantly the beautiful duskyskinned woman appearing to be about nineteen or so lifted herself out of the device she had woken within planting her feet on a cool yet not uncomfortable floor covering her body was a grey formfitting dress that only allowed her head and hands to remain clear. Once she was fully erect she blinked before looking around to take in all the very unfamiliar surroundings while one hand rubbed the fabric cloaking her other arm the completely alien feel of the material making her scowl...What are you doingCrying out in shock the ravenhaired queen spun around to see what seemed to be a Nubian to her dressed akin to something like the guards that protected her while she lived in her palace...even if the spearlike device now being levelled at her didnt have any recognizable sharp point. Before she could demand what was going on she did understand his words as some type of ancient patois spoken by her subjects she then tensed as a wave of something washed through her from the obvious guards direction indicative of his clear displeasure at her actions.Why are you not in that pod Rakalach he demanded levelling the walnutshaped end of his spear at her face as it opened an ominous glow emerging from with. Get back in there NOW...Her hand shot up to bat away the weapon she thanking her lovers for teaching her some selfdefence moves. The guards eyes went wide at her burst of speed then lunged over to snare her hand.That was a mistake.Both people yelped as Cleopatra felt her mind plunge right into the guards very SOUL he stumbling enough to make her force him onto the floor her free hand slapping his spear well out of his reach... ...two bizarre vehicles engaged in battle against Nyxs night such dotted by many twinkling stars... The guard screamed as he tried to force her away from him she tightening her grip on his hand as her free hand slammed down on his face to bash him into the floor and stun him... ...numerous people with pointed ears lying either dead or wounded in hallway somewhere the guard and his friends moving to slay the latter group with strange lightlike energy blasts from their spears... He howled as he felt his very soul being laid bare by the queens mental onslaught that causing something in his abdomen to stir under the light cloth of his tunic... ...the guard and his companions smiling on seeing dozens of sarcophaguslike chambers with clear covers each bearing what appeared to be women dressed in the same type of fullbody covering... She screamed as she sensed whatever it was surging out from the guards body punch through his tunic revealing a snakeeellike being with THREE jaws and winglike forearms moving to bite her... ...one of the women the guard and his friends had taken from the other people being HER... Cleopatra snared the creature and pulled to keep it away from her yanking same out of the guards body. As he howled in agony from that act she felt her mind plunge into the creatures own soul... ...born of a living god... ...born to conquer... ...bonded to a slave to be carried within his body until it was time for it to seize its own host body... The last queen of Egypt hissed as her free hand literally CRUSHED the creatures head with a show of strength no man she ever met in her lifetime could possibly equal The guard jolted as if he was struck by Zeus own lightning he sensing his precious primta be squashed by Cleopatras hand while his own body began to shut down from the severed bond that had kept him alive and well. As she gazed in wideeyed yet understandable confusion at him he felt his vision ominously darken.The legends were true... he rasped as his heart seized up. To sin against...the...Rakalach...Silence fell as a final rattled breath escaped him his body going slack as his spirit fled. Gazing upon the dead guards nowtranquil face Cleopatra uttered a quiet prayer to see the brave and loyal mans soul carried off to whatever his version of Elysium was within the realms of Hades. Slowly rising to her feet she then looked behind her before blinking in shocked recognition on seeing the many other chambers like the one she had woken in lining both sides of this chamber...A chamber......within a great pyramid of all things that flew throughout Nyxs dark heavens......far FAR beyond the bounds of Mother Gaia herself......far FAR beyond the soothing light of Apollos bright sun...Shaking her head as she tried not to scream out at the torrent of information her very mind absorbed from the guard and his serpentine symbiote realizing she was now in a situation that no philosopher of her time period could EVER begin to conceptualize Cleopatra shook her head as her mind focused on one bit of knowledge that she gained How to open the other chambers bearing their precious cargo. With that she moved to examine the one sitting directly beside hers......before she blinked in curious surprise on noting how PALE this particular woman was blessed with hair the shade of rich soil that flowed past her shoulders. At first thinking this woman to be of the mysterious Celts who had pressed south against the northern reaches of Macedonia where her ancestors had emerged to conquer the known world over three centuries before her birth the queen then shook her head as her hand slammed down on the red button by the other womans elbow.Im not sure whats going on... Cleopatra muttered as she watched the other womans dark bluegrey eyes opened ...but I need to find a way off this Hades bedamned ship...Cher Dieu...je suis vivant...Hearing that odd speech the queen considered something before she reached out with her hand in offering. Noting that as she tried not to stop and gape in wideeyed confusion at her current surroundings this certainly was NOT the Place de Gr√®ve in Paris fourth arrondissement where she was to confront Madame Guillotine after her premeditated murder of that maniac Marat over a week ago she nodded her thanks at the Arabiclike womans offer to help then grasped her hand...Both cried out as their minds instantly locked with the others memories from two lifetimes separated by EIGHTEEN CENTURIES of time instantly flooding the other womans souls. As the last queen of Egypt and one of the victims of the Terror watched each others very LIVES play before their minds eyes something else awoke in them. That made MarieAnne Charlotte de Corday dArmont blush madly at the idea of finding herself one of the legendary queens ladiesinwaiting within Alexandria a place clearly not touched by the Muslim hordes that ran over the region centuries after Cleopatras suicide. Sensing how much the beautiful brunette loved the handsome Marcus Antonius even if such a relationship had been born from her desperate desire to keep the hordes of Rome at bay...Finally Cleopatra hissed. That man was a monster...Blinking on realizing that she could now understand and speak Rankumat the native of √âcorches in Normandy nodded on sensing what the other woman was referring to. Yes he was she said with the accent of her native land making the reborn queen before her tense as she tried not to laugh at such odd tones. Even if my own life would be forfeit there was no choice especially with the many people being made to face the guillotine because of what Marat and his allies were demanding...You faced such a death bravely... Here the native of Alexandria blushed as she realized she was still holding the Norman womans hand. Um...how do you like to be called... You have so many names...I am Charlotte Your Majesty. Here she gave Cleopatra a curtsey. Now much that Im relieved to be still alive Im as lost as you seem to be as to where we are. This is some sort of SHIP...That flies through the dark realm of Nyx the other woman finished. Aye this is no situation I could have dreamed of. Nor you I suspect. As to HOW this happened I did not gain much from him.That comment made the native of √âcorches look at the fallen guard then she focused on the eellike thing nearby. Some fellow forced to be a BIRTH MOTHER to some alien creature... Charlotte hissed.He had no choice. Still he died well Cleopatra noted before she shook her head pulling her hand back. Come Lets free the others here then try to determine a way to be free of this place.Charlotte nodded as they moved to inspect the next chamber... An hour later... Oh my Queen Look out thereHearing the cry from the princessturnedoracle cursed by Apollo himself and all because she had spurned his desires for her Cleopatra looked over her shoulders. What is it Kass√°ndrƒÅSeeing where the native of Troy who had lived through the infamous wars that wrecked that city was pointing outside a vast window into the dark night the last queen of Egypt and the six others who had been held by someone claiming to be none other than Nephthys herself though Cleopatra herself now had some serious doubts thanks to her actually touching the soul of that primta creature who had been carried inside the body of the guard she killed after awakening gathered to look outside......before their jaws collectively dropped with both awe and wariness.Its a ship of some sort HuƒÅ M√πl√°n exclaimed.A predreadnought battleship French or Russian I think Margaretha Geertruida Zelle declared.From MY homeland Charlotte de Corday exclaimed.Ja Mevrouw de Corday the native of Leeuwarden in the northern Netherlands who later became famous through her stage name Mata Hari affirmed with a delighted nod before she shook her head in disbelief. Clearly adapted to fly in space and quite larger than what I remember...Wait Cassandra said pointing. Theres Greek written by one endPeople looked. Sure enough at one end of the craft now hovering nearby was a clear line of angled characters that hearkened to the days of ancient Greece and its descendant lands all in bright gold... –°–≤—è—Ç–∏–π –ü–∞–Ω—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π–º–æ–Ω –¶—ñ–ª–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å Zb...I dont know that third letter...t...what do those final two letters mean Paet...that looks like an √®psil√≥n following...l...another √®psil√≥n and that odd letter...moe. A √Ωpsilon then i strange letter t the √®psil√≥n again l then a b√™ta... a perplexed Cleopatra called out grateful she now had VERY sharp vision that could pick out details at a distance. If thats from your time Margaretha can you read itThe famous courtesanturnedspy from the Great War shook her head sadly she holding up her hands in regret. I never had reason to deal with Russians in my day Uwe Majesteit she stated with honest regret then she looked at one of the three Oriental women with them a mannishlooking older teenager whom the others knew was had been royalty of a line as ancient as Cleopatras. What of you Uwe Hoogheid You certainly had to deal with those accursed Communists from Russia before your...Here Margarethas voice trailed off as an apologetic look crossed her face. Smiling at the famous spy whom she emulated in service of Imperial Japan during the Second World War the woman born √Äixƒ´nju√©lu√≥ Xi«ény√∫ and known better to history as Kawashima Yoshiko nodded in understanding before peering intently at the vessel hovering nearby. If my knowledge of Cyrillic is anything close to accurate Mistress Margaretha that reads Svjat√≠j Pantel√©jmon Tsil√≠tel the native of Bƒõijƒ´ng blooddescent from the leaders of one of Qƒ´ng Chinas most prominent clans affirmed. Im nowhere close to being familiar with Russian but I believe the word svjat√≠j implies a saint in your traditions.Could there be a real saint here to save us Miss YoshikoHearing that from the youngest of their group sixyear old Virginia Dare from Englands first try at colonizing the Americas during the latter years of the reign of Queen Elizabeth Yoshiko smiled as she beckoned the emotionally younger girl closer to her. If that is so Little One then we are blessed indeed she affirmed as the only survivor of a terrible drought that had forced her parents and others to become part of the native Roanoac people moved to hug her leg in comfort.The other older women all beamed at the cute child before they gazed once more at the nearby space battleship. Its so quiet... the shamanturnedqueen Yamato no Himiko warned.Agreed my Queen Cassandra advised grateful she possessed something of her precognition to understand what was going on. Even if that ship there seems to be a sign of the gods favour...We best move Cleopatra affirmed. Lets keep looking.The others grimly nodded then reluctantly pulled away from the vast window as Margaretha Yoshiko and Charlotte would have addressed such a thing and the craft hovering close to the vessel they had woken in. I wonder how long its been the Angel of Assassination from the French Revolution mused looking around. This must be well past Yoshikos time and that horrid world war she endured...I believe the more important question we should ask is not when but why Mistress Charlotte Cassandra advised. We should all be dead we remember dying...and yet here we are alive and well.Not to mention deaged Himiko mused. I was over seventy seasons old when I went to be with the gods. Now I look no more than eighteen. The same with all of you as well save the Little One.Definitely intentional Margaretha then advised. We were allowed to live again for a purpose.Can you think of what purpose that might be Mistress Margaretha M√πl√°n asked. What of you Lady Xi«ény√∫ she inquired of her fellow countrywoman. Given both your work as spies...The other two women shook their heads. I wish I could think of what it might be Mistress M√πl√°n Yoshiko affirmed as she tried not to stare in obvious awe at the legendary warriors daughter from the Northern W√®i whose existence was the gristle of myth and childs fables when she was growing up in Bƒõijƒ´ng. To have living proof before her that the centre figure of the M√πl√°nc√≠ was REAL... Still regardless of why this happened to us I believe being alive is much more preferable than being...Everyone then jolted on hearing something ominous. Fighting M√πl√°n hissed.As the others tensed footfalls echoed from a side hallway......before three women in Egyptianstyle dress marched out one clearly being the leader if her aura of haughtiness and lavish clothes indicated anything. All three stopped their eyes widening in surprise on seeing the group of eight nearby. Then the leader of the group sneered her confusion turning to outraged fury. How did you get out of those pods Rakalach she snarled in a curiously echoing voice that sent chills down peoples backs pointing at them with a semiarmoured hand.Virginia yelped as she hid behind Yoshiko the others shielding her as the leaders attendants drew what some realized had to be handheld weapons. Did you put us there Mevrouw Margaretha snarled.No one speaks to me that way the other woman snapped. Make these fools bow to their godAt once Lady Nephthys the attendants snapped as the levelled their weapons......only to have them savagely kicked away by M√πl√°n and Himiko as the others save Yoshiko and Virginia charged. Squawking with outrage that her current slaves were revolting Nephthys levelled her armoured hand in the direction of one of them not sensing Cleopatra herself wheel around to her right while Charlotte Margaretha and Cassandra moved to support the amateur general from the Northern W√®i and the shamanqueen of Yamatokoku. Before the woman who called herself the goddess of the night and counterpart to the Greek goddess Nyx could sense the danger in time the arms of the last true pharaoh of Egypt snaked around her neck a hand grasping her throat. No...Instantly Cleopatras mental powers as to what she had and what she could do none of her new friends could imagine went to work the memories of this being replaying within the last pharaohs mind at a speed that would have knocked her insensate had she been back in Alexandria. As the noise of fighting nearby echoed faintly in her ears a hideous snarl escaped Cleopatras lips as the true nature of the deities she and so many others had worshipped both in Egypt and beyond sank in hard.PS√âFTIKI THE√Å she screeched as that phenomenal strength which first appeared when she killed the creature within that guard who clearly believed this being who underneath the cloak of a normal woman was in truth a more mature alien serpenteel than what the guard himself had born within his body surged up anew to choke Nephthys in a grip of pure diamond. AP√ÅTI PS√âFTIS MAY YOU BURN FOREVER IN HADES FOR ALL YOUR CRIMES FALSE GODDESSThe attendants struggling with Himeko and Charlotte looked over then shrieked as she forced the shamanqueen and the aristocrats child away from her before she levelled her zatniktel pistol. UNHAND HER RAKALACH... she then barked out keying off the safety...A shriek made everyone yelp as a bolt of bright energy engulfed the womans weapon and hand turning both into mist in the blink of an eye. As the woman yowled from the loss of her limb a blur of silver white and gold raced before her before an arm cloaked in a billowing white sleeve swept back to smack the woman in the side of the head sending her FLYING over to smash headfirst into a nearby wallShe wouldnt rise from that.Pryvit√°nnja ladies.Everyone even the gasping Nephthys stopped to look...A saint... a wideeyed Virginia then whispered.Hearing that from the cute child nearby the mannish woman with the shaggy hair of pure silver and eyes of burning chestnuts blinked before she politely nodded to the first English child born of the New World. Given the flowing white robes with very baggy trousers she had on trimmed in silver topped with intricate green Cyrillic notations as well as Russian Orthodox crucifixes in natural wood shades it didnt take the others knowledgeable in Christian lore to understand why the youngest of their group would mistake this newcomer for one blessed by God Himself. As rapid footfalls heralded the approach of others the newcomer gazed on the other attendant who had been disarmed by M√πl√°n and Margaretha Cassandra had moved to help Cleopatra keep down the struggling Nephthys naturally on touching the wouldbe Goauld system lord the princessturnedoracle was just as outraged as her spiritual countrywoman to learn the truth of their gods and was now being forced to the floor by the Northern W√®i warrior and the Dutch courtesanspy. If I may ladies she politely asked.M√πl√°n and Margaretha gazed on her then backed off from their opponent. Before the woman could recover or grasp her zatniktel the newcomers eyes glowed as bright as the Sun itself before twin pulverizing beams of energy ripped through her head from the side fortunately for Virginia Yoshiko instantly shielded the child from such a gory sight. Sl√≠pa nekult√∫rna dyt√Ωna... the newcomer then muttered shaking in her head before she focused on everyones host.Feeling that disgusted stare fall on her Nephthys shuddered as she tried to struggle free from the grasp of both Cleopatra and Cassandra fortunately for the last pharaoh of Egypt and the princessturnedoracle from lost Troy they now knew to keep that armoured hand away from them. Filthy Oraknou she spat out. Ill have your body melted down so I can seize your Gift seed...T√ùSHAThe namesake of the goddess of the night clammed up as the newcomers eyes glowed ominously...H√°lyna Jevh√©niovnaThat made the newcomer left. D√≥roti P√©trovna Klement√≠na Maksimili√°nova Vas√≠lissa Vas√≠levnaHeads turned to look......then Cleopatra and her companions all gaped in surprise on seeing three more women about the same age as their obvious rescuer literally FLY through the hallway to land nearby all looking as if they got some decent exercise in the last few minutes. We subdued the last of the Jaffa H√°lyna Jevh√©niovna the woman with the VERY long silver hair with strands tied in ponytails over her ears announced before she turned to see their main target now easily subdued by a group of women wearing a very familiar type of skinsuit. Avalonians... she exclaimed her own chestnut eyes wide with surprise. What in Gods name are THEY doing here I thought Admiral Moroboshi freed them allAs one of the newcomers dressed in the same type of flowing robes the first wore even if colours were understandably different moved to gaze upon the wideeyed Virginia the one called H√°lyna gazed over. Dont scare the Little One there Vas√≠lissa she then chided earning her an annoyed pout from the woman with the BLUE hair cropped at the shoulders. Much that none of us have their delightful empathy by the looks of them theyve been through quite an ordeal before we came.I AM Russian G√°lina √àvg√©niovna Vas√≠lissa declared.Net You are Chuvash not RussianThe woman named D√≥roti and the woman beside her a woman with long flowing black hair and a rather toothy smile laughed at the joke the others couldnt understand. Footfalls then heralded the arrival of a quite muscular man carrying what Yoshiko Charlotte and Margaretha instantly recognized as a rifle of some sort he dressed in an almostblack uniform with very darkshaded insignia. Captain he called out stopping before H√°lyna and giving her a salute which she returned with her own hand. Weve secured the whole ship now. A foxy knowing smile then crossed his face. I take it youre going to do a harvest for you and your old fleet mates from the oh√Ωdni zmij√≠ hereBut of course Comrade Lieutenant the mannish silverhaired woman affirmed before she waved to the people in the gestation suits all of whom clearly were relieved that people who clearly cared for them had come to remove them from Nephthys grasp. However weve seemed to have freed some unexpected prisoners this particular larbeke has taken along the way so my friends and I will get them back to the K√≥sPan before we start to cull the primta Get the men back aboard the ship.He saluted her. As you wish CaptainTurning he raced off. What about this one H√°lyna Jevh√©niovna D√≥roti asked.Before the namesake of the Egyptian goddess of the night and childhood could react a hand vastly more powerful than Cleopatras snared the system lord by the throat. Ill deal with this one D√≥rosha H√°lyna coolly declared. You and the others escort our new friends here to where we can get them onto the ship so we can learn their stories and find out how the devil a Goauld got its hands on Kalma Rakalach of all people For that Ive some questions for you N√©ftyda G√©bovnaUnfortunately her grip on Nephthys hadnt cut off all her oxygen. You...dare ATTACK...your gods...She was yanked into gazing at H√°lynas glowing eyes. Is that a trick question larbeke the silverhaired woman snarled in a voice as cold as ice that making the system lord croak in terror.A pained whimper answered her. Come on everyone D√≥roti then bade. Lets leave the old woman here to her fun You all look as if you havent eaten for some time now We have foodThat made the eight women from different periods of time instantly perk. As Virginia then ran into Vas√≠lissas welcoming arms to be carried off the other prisoners all of whom were now wondering what the appellation Avalonian actually meant and why it was applied to them moved to walk away from the scene. Now... H√°lyna trilled as she reached down to crush Nephthys karakesh with her free hand making the system lord shriek in pain before she was allowed to drop to the deck she moving to cradle her crushed hand. Decisions Decisions What will I do with you once I kill you Should I coat you in dough to make some var√©nyky or cut you to pieces for a serving of shashl√Ωk...Even wounded Nephthys instantly reacted to THATKEKULD HOW DARE YOU THREATEN TO EAT YOUR GODSA powerful slap to the head stunned her. Walking away from that scene Cleopatra paused as she looked back at the fake god before she gazed quizzically on D√≥roti. Eat your gods she asked.An amused chuckle answered the last pharaoh. Lets get you somewhere safe before we explain... To Be Continued... WRITERS NOTES This particular side story is set around the time of Part 21 in Book One of the main story. Save for two the ladies reborn here are historical figures whose stories can certainly be examined elsewhere. HuƒÅ M√πl√°n is as noted above the subject of the tale M√πl√°nc√≠ Ballad of M√πl√°n set during the era of the Northern W√®i dynasty which dominated northern China from 386535 CE. Cassandra hails from Greek mythology said to have lived at the time of the Trojan Wars believed to have occurred around 12601180 BCE her story is better explored in the Ili√°d as written by Homer. As for the system lord Nephthys she has never appeared in any version of Stargate SG1 she was created by myself.Translation list and source language √Åktion Proper spelling of the ancient town on the Ionian Sea known more commonly by the Latin term Actium near modernday Pr√©veza Greek Cher Dieu Dear God French Je suis vivant Im alive French Mevrouw Madame Dutch Uwe Majesteit Your Majesty Dutch Uwe Hoogheid Your Highness Dutch Svjat√≠j Pantel√©jmon Tsil√≠tel Saint Pantaleon the Healer Ukrainian Ps√©ftiki the√° False goddess Greek Ap√°ti Liar Greek Ps√©ftis Fake Greek Pryvit√°nnja Greetings Ukrainian Sl√≠pa nekult√∫rna dyt√Ωna Blind uncultured child Ukrainian T√Ωsha Silence Ukrainian Oh√Ωdni zmij√≠ Dirty snakes Ukrainian K√≥sPan Short for Kosm√≠chnyj P√°ntsernik Star Armourclad Ukrainian Larbeke Snake leech Yizibajohei Var√©nyky Perogies Ukrainian Shashl√Ωk Marinated lamb shish kebab Ukrainian.As an aside the term Rakalach can be seen as translated as souls touched by the Sun in Goauld. This is Freds invention to mark natives of the planet Sagussa which first appeared in his fanfic series The Senior Year. Naturally Kalma Rakalach would mean children of the souls touched by the Sun the word kalma has appeared in Stargate SG1. This represents the Sagussans bioroid descendant race the Avalonians who also appeared in TSY. Also both terms Oraknou and Kekuld are Freds creation the former literally means unspeakable devil and the latter means eater of gods. These words were created using Coptic the last remnant of the ancient Egyptian language as inspiration.Rankumat is the name of the ancient tongue of Egypt itself as pronounced in its native language.Comparing the similarlooking ancient Greek and Ukrainian Cyrillic alphabets to explain Cleopatras more than understandable confusion on see K√≥sPan Svjat√≠j Pantel√©jmon Tsil√≠tel.

In Ukrainian her name is written –ì–∞–ª–∏–Ω–∞ –Ñ–≤–≥–µ–Ω—ñ–æ–≤–Ω–∞ –ì–æ–ª–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞–ü–æ—Ç—å–æ–º–∫—ñ–Ω–∞. In Russian such could possibly be read G√°lina √àvg√©niovna G√≥likovaPot√≥mkina note that in Russian Cyrillic theres no standalone h letter i is inscribed as –ò–∏ and y is actually inscribed as –´—ã. Also note the Russian √® is written as –≠—ç the mirror of the Ukrainian je –Ñ—î letter. In Russian the standard –ï–µ is often pronounced with a j when the letter appears either after a vowel or at the start of a word for example the name Elizav√©ta –ï–ª–∏–∑a–≤–µ—Ç–∞ is pronounced j…™l ≤…™z…êÀàv ≤et…ô. In Ukrainian the –ï–µ is pronounced without the j regardless of the position the letter appears.And thats the only clue youll get about who H√°lyna once was at this time,Teen And Up Audiences,Not Found

The planet Uru west of Onishuto near the Invader home Earth date Wednesday 25 April 2001 0312 UTC T≈çky≈ç time Wednesday 25 April 2001 1212 PM... A wailing cry echoed through the Terrible Swamps. It was the sound of a child who just had her innocence taken away totally and utterly. Someone who at the very tender young age of six just learned what sort of real ruthless monsters there existed in the vast Universe beyond the safety of her own homeworld. Someone who would never have a normal life again. A girl who had been crippled for something she simply didnt understand. A girl... Hey Ayumuchan Can you see whos crying As the shuddering Redet Lum perked on hearing that strangelyaccented voice echo from nearby said voice echoing with the strange warbled speech one would expect when using an omniversal translator system she then blinked on hearing another girl call back in a voice that sounded almost Urusian. Nah I cant see her Tarikochan Hey she called out. Whos crying Are you okay Lum sniffed then she looked over... ...as a girl her age that looked almost Fukunokami save for normal ears one would find on an Ellsian walked out from behind a dandelion trunk. Looking around for a moment she then stopped on seeing the wetcheeked Oni warlords child seated on the ground near another big dandelion dressed in her favourite tigerstriped pinafore. On seeing her the newcomer walked over to stand close to her kneeling to stare intently into Lums eyes. Hey You see a girl whos been crying really bad she asked before blinking on noting the fresh tears welling in Lums green eyes. Hey How come youre crying I think shes the girl we sensed all the way back from the cabin Ayumuchan. Lum turned...and then blinked on seeing another girl the same age as the girl who just approached her. She was also Fukunokamilike in general looks again with Noukiitetype ears with shaggy brown hair and brown eyes on a rather plain face. Noting the girl that had just come up to her also had brown hair and eyes Lum then sniffed. Are you siblings she quietly asked glad that she also had a universal translator put into her mind so that she could understand the strangers words. Well we could be the first girl answered. But Tarikochan had to leave home because his parents were dorks. My parents are on Earth. Why are you crying Lum blinked though a small part of her was surprised to realize these two children were Terrans as far as she knew nations on Earth couldnt send people beyond the orbit of their moon in manned ships then she wept anew as she pointed at her neck. The newcomers looked...before they gaped on seeing the black collar around her neck with the small power unit there an ominous red light flashing right under the Onis chin. A powerdampener Who the heck put that on you the second girl with the shaggier hair demanded as she reached over to jab her index finger into the metal of the collar. Lum gasped as the collar broke into two pieces and fell to the ground beside her. She looked to both sides of her to see the shattered sections of the collar that just totally wrecked her life on the ground. Remembering what she learned in galactic kindergarten concerning the use of powerdampeners on an Oni child Lum blinked as fresh tears appeared in her eyes then she started to cry again. The newcomers blinked in surprise at that reaction from their new friend then the first girl peered intently for a moment her eyes glowing slightly with a powerful fire. After a minute she then nodded. Oh I get it As the other girl looked curiously at her she said Some meanie put a powerdampener on Lumchan here to take her powers away because shes so young she said in a voice that echoed with a strange level of maturity that made Lum stop as she stared in confusion at her. Cause her powers havent had the chance to mature properly she cant fly and cant hit people with electricity. The other girl instantly looked disgusted. Taking a Gift away Only Oblivion has the right to do that She then stared at Lum. Hey Lumchan Did some guy dressed in a black uniform like mine and having a black symbol like Ayumuchans got on her... She then stopped as something came to her. Hey wait a minute Oblivion wouldnt use a powerdampener He IS a powerdampener What do we do Can you zap her with an Infinite Wave The first girl hummed then she reached over to tap Lums arm. The Oni gasped as SOMETHING powerful surged through her from that contact making her body spark as justsuppressed bioelectrical powers flared back to full juvenile strength and she was able to leap into the air and float there. I can fly she yelped as she started to zip around the tree as fast as a six yearold girl from Uru could go. The two newcomers nodded in delight... ...while unseen by them a dwarfish figure cloaked in black lurked within the vast field of pink dandelion plants that formed the outer layer of flora bordering one of Urus most foreboding places of real estate. So...they finally had a girl eh... Cold laughter echoed over this tranquil scene...

BOOK ONE BOY MEETS GIRL MEETS METAHUMAN The planet Earth Tomobiki High School in Japan the third Friday in November in 2012 first afternoon period... PAY ATTENTION REDETKUNKYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH...A pained scream escaped Onsen Mark thanks to bioelectricity escaping the most exotic member of this years traditional class of failure making others duck just in case this burst of power from Redet Lum was going to do what it had done on two prior occasions this school year alone to wreck the classroom if not the whole damn BUILDING As the gruff vice principalEnglish teacher collapsed into a twitching mass on the floor the warlords daughter from Onishuto blinked for a moment. A...dream...As Moroboshi Ataru rolled his eyes at his wifes latest display of reckless behaviour Tsuruya Rumiko bolted to her feet snaring her chair before flinging it right into Lums face BAKAMONO WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO TEACH YOURSELF THAT ARCANE CONCEPT CALLED SELFCONTROLThe girls in the class laughed on seeing the woman they once saw as the one surefire protection against her husbands lechery but all universally now saw as a VERY unwanted na√Øve interloper whos final departure from Earth ultimately couldnt come soon enough now smashed into the back wall of the room While most boys in class sent resentful looks towards Rumiko for what she just did to their favourite classmate while outraged shouts echoed from people in nearby classes Ataru moved to help Onsen back to his feet. Here we go K≈çch≈çsensei the former muttered as he helped walk the older man to the desk so he could sit. Oi Chigaikochan You got some spare ice teaHai hai Inu Chigaiko called out from her desk in the corner of the room before walking over to join her friend. Here you go Sensei the star basketball team forward bade as she put a can on the desk.A grunt answered her. Arigat≈ç Inukun... Onsen rasped before he sipped from the can. Once you dig yourself out from under Tsuruyakuns desk Redetkun you can go stand in the hall...SENSEI CANT YOU SEE LUMSAN IS IN... KKKLONK A mallet to the skull sent Mend≈ç Sh≈´tar≈ç facefirst into the ground She STILL is a fire hazard Sword for Brains Ataru calmly declared as many boys snickered on seeing the class richest member laid low like that. While there were some hurt looks among several of the girls present who were still bedazzled by Sh≈´tar≈çs considerable family wealth and quite suave behaviour too many of the female population of Class 24 had over the last few months become too frustrated with his slavish devotion to Lum to be tolerated. Someone want to go dump the fool out of the classroom please If shes daydreaming shes a worse fire hazard now than she normally is when she CLAIMS shes my wifeHai AtarukunAs the members of Lums Stormtroopers squawked in outrage after hearing that from their hated rival naturally the four young men now universally loathed by almost ALL the girls in school for their own support of the warlords daughter had moved to comfort her his exgirlfriend Miyake Shinobu calmly walked over tossed aside the chair then snared her by the back of her seifuku collar before dragging her to the door. Throwing that open she sent the stilldazed alien teenager in an overhand pitch......sending her flying through an open window to crash on the courtyard a floor belowAs many boys screamed Shinobu gasped. Oh dear I didnt see the open window she lamented before shaking her head turning to walk back to her desk a helpless shrug twitching her shoulder.Miyake... escaped the Stormtroopers leader Aisuru Satoshi AKA Megane in a vile hiss.AlQƒÅidah... Ataru singsonged.All four boys turned into instant statutes making the girls all laugh... After classes... TEI...TO...KU...Hearing that energized shout with its mixture of Cumbrian English and Kansai Japanese Moroboshi Ataru took a deep breath. Stand clear please he advised the people walking out with him.Instantly people backed away from his side... KKKLOMP Oh Teitoku I missed you so much this week the cooing shapely woman appearing to be twenty or so now glomping Ataru in a way that would make one N«ö ShƒÅnp√∫ in neighbouring Nerima green with envy moaned in nearorgasmic delight before the newcomer began showering his face with kisses.As the people watching this giggled or laughed at Chihaya Annes normal antics whenever she came to express her heartfelt burning love for the man she currently saw as her spiritual admiral footfalls echoed from the main doors that accompanied by the alltoofamiliar faint whiff of burning ozone. DARLING WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT FLIRTING WITH THESE STUPID HUSSIES...A blast of Arctic cold washed over the scene before Ataru looked up. Arigat≈ç Fujikochan.A lithe form about his age landed close to him she snapping to attention while giving him a paradeperfect salute. Shireikan we came to escort you to Headquarters so your sisters will be able to see youre well Fukushima Fujiko smartly declared before lowering her arm then bowing politely. As cries of anguish escaped the Stormtroopers on seeing Redet Lum encased in ANOTHER block of ice created by the cute brownhaired cryokinetic who claimed Maizuru as her home town she added We received a message from Chikagesan. She did a Tarot reading this morning. She believes that the strongest measure of protection concerning yourself must be carried out over the next week or so.He blinked. Oh Did Chikagechan say whyAll she could sense was a wave of darkness overcoming Tomobikich≈ç Shireikan.Which means that next weeks fun might have someone come along to spoil things he concluded before shifting himself slightly to get Anne down to the ground. Of course to dispel the automatic pout the adopted native of Chihayaakasaka near ≈åsaka made on being prevented from cuddling further with her admiral he offered his arm to her which she took with a squeal. Hai Hai he breathed out before giving Tsuruya Rumiko and Inu Chigaiko an apologetic look. Much that I hoped to have a little snack with you guys before heading over to be with the sisters Fate seems to have other ideas for me.Like it always does Chigaiko stated with a wink before she waved him on towards the main gate. Go on home Ataru You dont want to make your MATRIARCH unhappyHai hai...And with that he was nearly pulled off the school grounds by an excited Anne with a smirking Fujiko following them off the property. By then Miyake Shinobu and several of the other girls from Class 24 were stepping outside. Ah shit Who the hell was it THIS time Fujinami Ry≈´nosuke demanded as she gazed at the stillfrozen Lum glad said ice block was at least NOT standing in peoples way.Fujikochan this time Ry≈´nosuke Rumiko stated as she gave her oncelover a knowing look and a wink. Chikagechan did a Tarot reading and the girls got nervous.What did Chikagesan say Rumikochan Shinobu wondered ignoring the incensed looks from the Stormtroopers as she passed by the frozen Lum without doing anything to help her.Something about a wave of darkness coming over Tomobiki.The girls hearing this blinked as they considered that warning before tired moans escaped them many heads drooping. Oh gods Whats it going to be this time Marubeya Momoe grunted.I hope its not as bad as when that Lupica girl came by in July Gekasawa Kumiko muttered.The girls then headed off chattering away leaving their frozen peer behind. OI WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU GOING YOU STUPID BITCHES Megane shrilled after them. LUMSAN NEEDS TO BE FREE SO SHE CAN PUNISH THAT BASTARD ATARU FOR FLIRTING WITH... KKKLONK Baka Youre as completely BLIND as you are chronically STUPID Megane I saw Annesan putting the moves on Ataru not the other way around the gorgeously tanned tomboyish T≈çno Mizuki from Class 27 snapped after smashing the loudmouthed fool down with her book bag.Give up Mizukichan her ravenhaired best friend Fujiwara Aya declared as she gave the others in Meganes gang of fanatics a thoroughly disgusted look. No doubt Redets been having sex parties with her most faithful to keep them loyal to her while she continues to chase Ataru.Hai Hai Ayachan that would make a tonne of sense their class alien member Lums childhood friend Aruka Ran mused as she tried not to grin on seeing her rival literally on ice now.Oh man What did Lumchan do THIS timePeople looked as a cute OniUrusian preschooler flew over to join them from the direction of the Moroboshi home. Oh Tenchan Konnichi wa Mizuki said with a wave of her hand as Lums maternal cousin Redet Ten came to a hover near her and her fellow Tomobiki High Mahjong Club members. Annesan was being her normal self with Teitoku and Lum overreacted as usual. Fujikochan froze her in place before she could try to deliver some divine punishment on the poor man.The firefighters son from Onishuto blinked before he moaned slapping his forehead. Lumchan how many times have I gotta keep telling you this he snapped at her fortunately Fujiko could control her powers enough to ensure the older alien could breathe and listen to people even if she was imprisoned in thick ice. Annechan is a reborn thirtyseven thousand tonne FAST BATTLESHIP from the Terrans Second World War You couldnt do more than TICKLE her with your best zap And Fujikochans a reborn two thousand tonne DESTROYER who can outdo Oyukichan with her powers What are you trying to do Make them so mad that theyll freeze you in place and throw you into the SUN As the Stormtroopers cringed on hearing that Ten waved them away. Here Ill get her out of thereWhy dont you just let her stew for a bit Mizuki asked.Lumchans dad just called in. Something about their finding her greatgrandpa.People blinked in confusion... The Moroboshi home an hour later... Your cousins greatgrandfather Little OneHai Yoikoonƒìchan Redet Ten said as he gazed into the face of the sheer colossus of a woman now seated seiza in the guest bedroom of the Moroboshi home some blocks from the main gate of Tomobiki High School. As noises from the main floor echoed the outrage Atarus mother Moroboshi Kinsh≈ç was unloading on her husband Muchi concerning the imposing presence of the transformed seventh carrier of Operation Z and the last of the Yamatoclass warships within their house the firefighters son from Onishuto added Turns out they put him into cryosleep twenty years ago for some reason then his capsule was left with Uncle and Auntie before they moved into their present house near the Terrible Swamps. They were doing renovations when they found the capsule and got Greatgrandpa up so Uncle and Auntie wanted Lumchan to come over for the weekend to see him.The woman who had been christened over seventyone years before as Tenn≈ç Heika Gunkan Yonaga now going by the name It≈ç Yoiko hummed before a light smile crossed his face. Ara Ara How forgetful of your uncle and aunt. I hope your greatgrandfather will not take offence the adopted native of Maizuru where she had been built noted before nodding as Kotatsuneko poured her a new cup of the cloudberry tea developed by her crew in the decades of imprisonment within the glacierfilled cove known as Sanowan on the Arctic coast of Siberia near Cape Dezhnj√≥va such had been necessary to ensure proper vitamins could be consumed to stave off diseases like scurvy. Tell me Little One did this fellow ever serve in your peoples armed forces Did he ever experience combatTen readily nodded. Hai He was a general in the Marines he even taught Grand General Lana all the tricks of the trade He then smirked before adding Greatgrandpa was one of the really incorruptible ones in the Corps. Creeps like Reis uncle and his friends in the Imperial Round wouldnt EVER get away with the stunts theyve pulled if Greatgrandpa was still around to knock em into line...Ah There you are young manTen gushed. Ah Ky≈çsuke≈çojichanThe young man flew over into the arms of a smiling man appearing in his early twenties who bore a very strong resemblance to Tens wouldbe cousininlaw. The only real differences between Moroboshi Ataru and Lieutenant Moroboshi Ky≈çsuke of the Imperial Japanese Navy was the latter now possessed a weatherbeaten face thanks to exposure to the high Arctic for decades not to mention a welltrimmed moustache and goatee framing his mouth. Thanks to the heavy layers of diamond and ruby mesonium deposits within Sanowan a layered magical defence system made by the wise avian therianthropic inhabitants of the cove when they turned it into a redoubt where their governing parliament always met the aging process of everyone assigned to THG Yonaga was severely retarded even if he looked quite young in the eyes of normal people the native of Sendai just celebrated his hundredth birthday in August. So whats this I hear about your cousins greatgrandfather he then wondered.Ten smirked as the older man carried him back to the kotatsu that Ky≈çsukes transformed base ship and the firefighters sons best friend were sitting by before he explained what he had been told by his uncle Redet Invader. Ignoring footfalls from the hallway indicating that his nephew and nieceinlaw were listening in neither of Atarus parents wanted to risk the wrath of a reborn 86010 tonne heavy armoured attack aircraft carrier...especially one whose crew had spent over SEVEN DECADES teaching and reteaching themselves all the tenets true samurai loyal to Bushid≈ç were to adhere to as dictated in books like Yamamoto Tsunetomos Hagakure and Miyamoto Musashis Go Rin no Sho both holdouts from the days of the Greater East Asia War nodded before exchanging knowing looks while the younger man continued his tale. After Ten got finished Ky≈çsuke reached over to squeeze his shoulder. Ill be happy to inform Admiral Fujita about this the junior navigation officer assigned to the man who would have been the commander of the Pearl Harbour attack Admiral Fujita Hiroshi of Nagoya and Hiroshima then stated holding up a finger in emphasis. Im sure that if your greatgrandfather is up to a voyage here to Earth he and the admiral can exchange all sorts of interesting war stories.Ten giggled though he was nodding with excitement at such an idea. Yeah Ill bet that Greatgrandpa would love to come visit Earth From what I read about him on the infonets he was as much of a Terranophile as he was a Noukiiophile. He could even say Yiziba and Yizibajohei tooAll three exchanged knowing smiles on hearing Kinsh≈ç fall on her face after hearing THOSE WORDS. Much that it was quite obvious that inhabitants of the world often known in the local cluster by phrases like The Unspeakable Place or You Know Where was extending their influence over Tomobikich≈ç Atarus mother still fervently believed that her idiot son had been made to forever forget the decade he lived practically alone on the third world of Kaeyu physically as a GIRL under the name Tariko Katabarbe and preparing for hisher destiny as one of the greatest reality warpers of that planet.How was the general able to speak those particular names Little One Yoiko then asked. As youve told us on several occasions since your own mind was freed of such abusive madness all children of your society are subject to deep memorybacked hypnotism to make it as if the modern generation had themselves endured the Mother of All Fight Scenes the Children of the Forge unleashed upon your old empire in answer to their grievous crimes upon your own distant ancestress Lady Redet Danu.Well rumour had it that he bumped into Ay... Here Ten caught himself. Um Master Tami Ugadese he was Infinity sometime ago. Greatgrandpa got into a shuttle accident when he was a subaltern an ensign to you and was rescued by Tamiojichan when he was passing through the Slot separating us from Ipraedies space. Blinking a question to Ky≈çsuke that resulting in a wink from Yonagas junior navigation officer that indicated that both of Atarus parents werent currently paying attention to them he then leaned over to whisper Ayumuonƒìchan was the one who told me that story.Ah Yoiko then peered towards the east. You overheard KasugadonoYeah Yoikochan I did the mental voice of the most powerful of the Children of the Forge echoed in the minds of the people in the guest room such transmitted from the Kasuga home in Itabashi. Ill go look in on Travellerkun right now. Something about Chikagechans warnings bugging me.Ten perked. Eh What did Chikageanekun say Ayumuonƒìchan he hissed.It was the same issue that made Fujiko react the way she did concerning your cousin Yoiko warned.The firefighters son blinked before he moaned. Oh no What now... At the first EarthMoon libration point approximately 320000 kilometres off the Earths surface that moment UTC time Breakfast Washington DC time Three hours after midnight... Conn Sensory.A finger tapped the control to open the 27MC to the main sensor control room. Conn Commander Bartolomeo Mancuso answered his eyes seeking out the large screen that gave the commanding officer of his remarkable new ship a condensed update of vessel status. What have you got JonseyConn Sensory we got Miss Redets ship lifting off from T≈çky≈ç airspace at this time Sonar Technician 2nd Class Ronald Jones Submarine Warfare called from his post in the MSCR located halfway down the superstructure from the pilotage of United States Starship Enterprise holding position at the confluence of gravitational fields between the third world of Sol and its natural satellite. Despite the view out the large portals that lined the forward end and flanks of the platform an exposed location that often scared the heck out of the many veteran submariners who made a good portion of the space aircraft carriers current plank owners it would be impossible to visually see the saucershaped tigerstriped craft from their location. Looks like shes making for insertion into Neptunian orbit.Mancuso grunted. Taking a shortcut to go home and meet GreatGrandpa through the Neptunians Stargate the Italiandescent native of Pittsburgh mused as he exchanged looks with his old executive officer on USS Dallas Lieutenant Commander Philip Thompson he now served as Enterprises operations officer. Tommy get the fire control crew to keep a weapons lock on her just in case.Aye Capn Thompson said with a grin before walking over to where the officer of the watch stood.After ordering Jones to keep track of the departing scout craft Mancuso took his place at the captains chair. Much to the delight of Star Trek fans among his crew the pilotage of USS Enterprise had been fashioned in a similar way to the bridge of James T. Kirks fictional command with the captains chair in the centre navigation and helm controls in front and to either side of him plus all work stations for a full watchkeeping crew forming a ring along the rooms sides. Of course given Mancusos new ship was a tentoone replica of the famous Grey Ghost from World War Two the pilotage was one of the most spacious places he ever worked in throughout his Navy career. Fortunately the technology given to the Terrans virtually without cost by the Avalonians a race of bioroids who had been liberated en masse from slavery months ago augmented by choice bits provided by many Terranborn Yizibajohei hypergenius polymaths who had been Gifted over the previous decade and more effectively eliminated the need to shout in a room that was THIRTY METRES wide sound transmission units made sure those who had to relay commands were heard. Mancuso didnt understand a tithe of how it worked but it did especially in heated conditions such as battle station drills which he had run the moment Enterprise left the Avalonians main dockyard on the anniversary of her namesakes launching the previous month.Tommy we keeping an eye on our other visitor the Pennsylvaniaborn submarine skipper asked.Aye Capn Thompson called back tapping a control on his own operations screen to get a quick update. Hes still at geosynchronous on OneThreeNiner East putting her effectively south of Tomobiki itself. No increase of power plant weapons or sensors. Hes just ignoring Miss Redet.Intel confirmed what was reported earlierAye Capn. Kingdom of Yaminokuni outer edge of the Orion Arm twentyfour hundred parsecs from here Dallas old executive officer read off. Vessel types a command cruiser normally used by a senior patriarch of the kingdom sort of equal to one of our state governors. Too far away to be bullied by the hornheads much less the snakes our Chair Force friends love to beat up on all the time.Snickers filled the bridge on hearing that last statement. After their submarine was struck from the Naval Vessel Register two years ahead of schedule the scuttlebutt that followed from the members of Dallas crew never ONCE predicted that they would wind up serving in deep SPACE of all places serving as plank owners of a STARSHIP of all things especially one designed as an outer space version of an AIRCRAFT CARRIER While the familiarity of the design made things rather comfortable the Avalonians had gone WAY out of their way to make Enterprise seem like a normal ship huge scale and technology straight out of Star Trek and Star Wars notwithstanding the unreality of it all still struck Mancuso and his subordinates hard at times. It hadnt led to disciplinary problems the five hundred AvalonianAmerican civilian technicians now aboard with them all vets of Redet Lums lost army from Phentax Two made things easy for normal folk but crew morale still fluctuated according to the ships senior enlisted rate Command Senior Chief Petty Officer Submarine Warfare Larry Watson a man still called COB chief of the boat given his prior post as Dallas final senior enlisted sailor.And speaking of which...Capn.Mancuso looked over. COBSGC just called in on the HWF the elderly submariner warned. Private message.Right. Tommy you have the bridge.Aye Capn. An hour later fortyseven light years away... Shuddering in delight as she felt the soothing rays of her own home sun wash over her Redet Lum slipped off her tigerstriped inclement weather uniform and moved to hang it in the entranceway of the starshipshaped elevated residence her parents Redet Invader and the former Seq Chim had called home since before her birth. Taking a deep breath as she straightened herself despite her being a civilian she was an effective defence fleet brat expected by her societys norms to behave in a certain way especially when people of a MUCH higher rank were present close relative or not she flew through the inner hatchway into the large living room. Dad Mom Im home she called out.The most famous native of the fourth world of Oniboshi inwardly winced on seeing the flash of relief cross her mothers face as she looked her way from a place right beside a hoverchair where a frail elderly balding man was reclining being looked after by Lums massive father. Still Chims reaction to seeing her precious daughter safe and sound was understandable. Ever since the aborted wedding between her and Moroboshi Ataru several months before the warlords daughter had wound up in intensive care a total of THREE more times in the wake of nasty disasters which befell her and her friends while she was residing in Tomobiki. While Lum and her peers brushed off those incidents given that the two occurring within Tomobiki High School itself were provoked by outofcontrol bursts of bioelectricity from her wrecking their immediate surroundings the third incident in the latter part of summer vacation was their being ejected from a POCKET DIMENSION of all things created by the socalled Memory of Tomobiki the frequency of such events had Chim obviously worried for her baby girl. Tack that onto the obviously growing rift of relations between Lum and her husband...Welcome home Lum the older woman called out speaking more clearly now thanks to Moroboshi Atarus adopted sister Moroboshi Negako effective steward of their overall clan and Earths first true artificial intelligence given her own life as an organic being a decade ago. During a meeting between Lums parents and Atarus sister Sukeyama Sakuya in the latter part of spring Negako noted Chims universal translator was inserted incorrectly within her mind. A quick treatment with pressure points saw it corrected which allowed the older woman to speak to anyone from Earth with ease now.Ah Lum the gregarious Invader called out then he looked over.A cackle escaped the elderly warrior as he moved to sip his spice tea. I sure am looking forward to this Redet Traveller said with an embarrassed look even if there was something of a distant gaze in his dark eyes. Noting that Lum could only wince. She had been taught the lessons about prolonged cryosleep and how it affected someones mind. Given how old the veteran Marine officer was when this had happened to him it wouldnt have done him any longterm good. Im blushing in factIts your first meeting after all the youngest battlewagon warlord in recent memory declared.Well I was in cryosleep for twenty years... the older warrior confessed before he clapped his hands in expectation. Ill bet hes a strong little boy just like his father...A wince answered him. Lums a girlAh I see I see After all I was in cryosleep for twenty years I see I see...Noting that Invaders words hadnt sank in Lum and Chim exchanged worried looks.Then those words DID sink inA GIRLTraveller started to hyperventilate while his whole body locked up for a moment making Invader move to render aid. What is it Grandpa Whats wrong he demanded as Chim came over to help.Lum remained in place as her parents proceeded to use the hoverchairs life support systems to get her recentlyrevived greatgrandfather to calm down and relax. After a couple tense moments the elderly warrior was breathing normally even if his eyes were awash in horrified tears. While Chim moved to get some fresh food to eat from the kitchen Invader leaned down to place a comforting hand on Travellers shoulder. Hey Cmon Grandpa Whats wrong with Lum being a girl he wondered.Uncontrollable sobs then answered him which made Invader shudder in frustration even if he made a hand sign to his daughter that telling Lum to move out of visual range while he strove to get control of this odd situation. Once she was clear of the elderly warriors line of sight the younger warlord took a deep breath before barking out like the best drill petty officer at officer candidate school I CANT UNDERSTAND YOU IF YOU KEEP CRYING LIKE THAT MARINE STRAIGHTEN UPIt wasnt totally enough. Oh This is terrible So terrible...Invader and Chim blinked before exchanging confused looks then they shrugged. Seeing that they werent getting anywhere with her greatgrandfather Lum then floated into visual range. That was enough for Traveller to stop and gaze her way in curiosity. Who are you he asked.Smirking at his daughters thinking Invader waved at his pride and joy. Shes the greatgrandchild you were so eager to see when we woke you up Grandpa he declared with a delighted smile.Im Lum she introduced herself.Silence.More silence.Still more silence.Then...Bbut...SHES A GIRLYeah She IS a girl Invader snarled. What about itDarkness descended over Traveller as he stared in disbelief on his descendant. Hhh... he sputtered as his mind tried to desperately reboot itself before he collapsed once again. How terrible...As sobs escaped the veteran warrior Lum gazed at her parents. Whats going onInvader moaned as Chim gave her a helpless shrug. Grandpa Wont you PLEASE tell us whats going on Lums father demanded in a calmer voice as he leaned down to gaze at his grandfather.Traveller looked at him honest curiosity crossing his face. Explain whatYOU WERE JUST CRYINGWho wasHAVE YOU GONE SENILEIll explain the reason.Gasps escaped the younger Urusians on hearing that strange voice before people spun around......just as footfalls heralded the arrival of someone draped in black one anyone on Earth might mistake for an Arab save for a light hanging from a hook tied to the newcomers iqƒÅllike band around his forehead as he stepped into the living room. Who the hell are you Invader demanded.Seeing the newcomer Lum winced. Thats the pitch black monster I saw in my dreamThe stranger headed over to the table where Traveller was seated beside before running face first into the edge the flaps of his ·∏•ijƒÅblike veil had fallen before his eyes. After reorientating himself he leapt up onto the table to gaze intently at the elderly warrior. Its been a long time Traveller...Invader gazed at his grandfather. You know himIncomprehension responded. I dont know any such person.A cackle one that made Lums hair stand on end as she recalled the dream she had in class earlier where she encountered this very same being in the glen bordering the Terrible Swamps when she was a child escaped the newcomer. No wonder he said as he moved to draw away the veil from his craggy face. It has been a hundred and twenty years after all. After exposing himself to reveal his aged and tanned skin with thin moustache framing his mouth a grin crossed his face. Its me.On seeing such a visage Traveller looked ready to have a heart attack. YYOUSilence fell as the two aged people gazed on each other......before the elderly Oni dozed off. DONT YOU DARE FALL ASLEEP ON ME the newcomer shrilled.That was enough to waken Traveller. Blinking as his mind seemed to reboot itself properly while he moved to lay back in his chair he breathed out It was all of a hundred years ago and more...So you DO remember the newcomer challenged his eyes narrowing dangerously.Yes yes I remember now...The tale was quite short and sweet. Over a century before thenSubaltern Redet Traveller had been visiting Reiners Five a vacation world in the neutral zone dividing the territories of the Confederation of Vos and thethen Ipraedies Socialist Republic this was just before the famous battle fought there that would affect the history of both peoples for many decades to come. After a wilderness trek caught him without rations and without money to get something from a handy vending machine the oncearrogant Traveller was forced to grovel to another alien then on that planet Patriarch Upa of Yaminokuni a very distant world which could only be realistically reached even today by the Noukiites. Untrustworthy of the Oni naval infantry officer understandable since the Union Revolution that had seen the old feudal Empire overthrown was still living memory among many across the local cluster Upa offered rations on the provision that Traveller allow the former to marry his daughter. However the sly Marine officer didnt have a daughter he had only a newborn son named Searcher later Invaders father.But Upa hadnt forgot that promise...So youre here to claim my little girl Chim shrilled as her own body sparked with bioelectricity.How can we trust your word about this old man Invader challenged.Because there was a witness a woman called out from the doorway.Silence.More silence.Still more silence.Then...Ah Young Ayumu Its been a while Upa then called out as people turned......before Lum and her parents nearly soiled themselves as the slender girl with shaggy shoulderlength dark brown hair centreparted on her forehead in frills to her eyebrows came into view her wide and very expressive browngrey eyes twinkling on seeing two people she had particular cause to remember. Of course the grey sleeveless formfitting battlesuit with the halter top shirt topped with a white belt around her waist white buccaneer boots on her feet and a white lemniscate insignia on her chest was all too familiar to the five people currently within that house. MISS INFINITY Invader bellowed like a little child who just got caught drawing on the walls with crayon by a very strict parent.Eh Youre the new Infinity My youre a young oneMass facefaults decked Invader Chim and Lum as the newcomer came into the visible light of the living room revealing the smiling face of one Kasuga Ayumu of Wakayama in Japan near ≈åsaka. Oha Travellerkun Upakun The woman who had inherited the power of the Goddess Who Walks Among Men Nodim Infinity twelve years before then crossed her arms a knowing look crossing her face. Dont tell me you guys are STILL going on about this silly idea of getting your kids marriedIts a matter of honour Ayumu Upa snapped. Especially given how much this man LIED to meAyumu Thats not a Yizibajohei name Im familiar withTravellers relatives shrieked on hearing THAT WORD escape his lips. Noting that Ayumu snapped her fingers. That made Invader Chim and Lum jolt before confused looks crossed their faces. Okay We get that youre all scared of people like me I understand that You dont need to shout the native of Wakayama stated before she gave Traveller a light smile. And Im from Earth by the way.Surprise crossed the old warriors face as Lum stared in wideeyed disbelief at the Goddess Who Walks Among Men. Earth Since when did Yiziba take interest in Earth of all places As his relatives gulped again on hearing THAT NAME escape Traveller though they didnt react as they had been effectively brainwashed into reacting upon hearing THAT NAME when they were children the old warrior added I know that Terrans and Yizibajohei are genetically related thanks to the predecessors of the Maidens of the Eternal Voyager but I never thought a Terran would be GiftedOh thats easy Ayumu answered. My oldest friend Tarikochan ran away from her mean parents and was adopted by Ayone Katabarbeobachan she was the lover of the last Tuyuki. As another chorus of gulps escaped the younger Oni in the room given what the incarnation of the Trickster of the Show at the time of the Mother of All Fight Scenes was like the fear many Urusians had about confronting any future incarnation of such a being was understandably profound the Infinite One added So she was preGifted to become the next Tuyuki then started a big casting drive to get other Terrans Gifted...WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT...That was a greyfaced Invader who now looked as if he was going to face a FIRING SQUAD once THAT news got to members of the Union Congress in downtown Onishuto given how psychologically important first contact with the third world of Sol had really been knowing THEY were there would unleash all sorts of panic across Urusian society as a whole As Chim and Lum hugged each other both sobbing at the idea of confronting people from Earth possessing the powers of They Who Must Never Be Named Traveller spun around and barked with the fierceness he had shown when he was an active officer QUIET BOY After his grandson bolted instantly to attention the aged warrior harrumphed. What in the Maidens Names is wrong with you You know the Terrans have had a long history with metahumans They live on the planet with the secondlargest deposits of mesonium outside Yiziba itself It was INEVITABLE that metahumans would arise there in the last century He then waved to the reality warper standing in their midst. And if what Ayumucha here just said is true and young Tarikocha was running away from abusive parents on Earth its a good thing Madame Ayone was there for the poor child Besides the Yizibajohei had DAMN good reasons to launch the Mother of All Fight Scenes against the fool Imperials given what happened to Lady Danu after she was ABANDONED on Yiziba when that fool Joth actually ACCUSED Master Rampage of CHEATING of all thingsThat cant be true Grandpa...ENOUGH Traveller snapped before he grunted. Damn I HAVE been in cryosleep for too long...It gets worse Travellerkun.He looked at Ayumu. What do you mean AyumuchaYou want to know what your grandson did last yearAs Invader balked the old warrior glared at him. What is she talking aboutHe led the invasion attempt on Earth last year Traveller Upa sternly declared.Silence.More silence.Still more silence.Then...WHAT WAS THATAs a tidal wave of VERY creative invective escaped Traveller Ayumu gave Upa a helpless shrug... Tomobiki the house south of the Moroboshi residence an hour later local time An hour after supper... Hey Yoiko.Yvonnesan.As the sun set over the Kant≈ç Mountains to the west of the vast urban sprawl that was modernday metropolitan T≈çky≈ç a beautiful blueeyed blonde in a pair of fashionable jeans and a white pullover turtleneck sweater Royal Navy surplus It≈ç Yoiko quickly noted came onto the veranda of the bedroom normally used by the reborn light cruisers Tenry≈´ and Tatsuta now the Shimosuwa twins Tamiyo and Tadako to sit crosslegged beside the transformed seventh carrier of Operation Z. Naturally the former THG Yonaga was enjoying her preferred cloudberry tea while sitting seiza and gazing at the growing evening over her homelands capital city dressed in her preferred winterpattern yukata specially made in one of T≈çky≈çs several magical districts due to her height and muscular build. Compared to her the reborn second of the Yorktownclass aircraft carriers now calling herself Yvonne Swanson was a normal American twentysomething who could easily have stepped out of the pages of Elle or Vogue her skin tanned thanks to her currently residing in Sweet Valley outside Los Angeles.Heard about the kids greatgrandfather she said as Yoiko moved to prepare a cup of tea for her guest she nodding in the direction of Moroboshi Atarus empty bedroom about four metres away.Hai Yoiko mused as she handed the cup to the reborn carrier her own crew had often vowed unholy vengeance on many a time during the Greater East Asia War while they were trapped in Sanowan. And while most of Yonagas officers and men still found it quite uncomfortable to know that the ship which survived all that Imperial Japan had thrown at her in that conflict had been reborn as their home ship had been the spirit of Japans greatest warship held the reborn USS Enterprise with great respect believing her blessed by all seven Christian saints who watched over sailors her crew in the war driven by the American version of the yamato damashii that drove Yonagas crew through seventyone years trapped in northeastern Siberia. A sloppy act on the part of Lumsans parents twenty years ago. Still Travellertaish≈ç hes a Marine general by the way is quite the Terranophile according to young Ten. Having him return even if he is on the inactive senior officers list might be to our advantage.Thank God for that small favour the adopted native of Newport News where she had been built and River Vale in New Jersey where her stern plate had been displayed until it was retrieved before her summoning and Gifting in early April noted before sipping her own tea much to the shock of other reborn American warship spirits commonly addressed as shipgirls in English the Japanese term was kantai musume maiden of the fleet who had been summoned back to duty the effective living personification of American determination in the Pacific War preferred tea over coffee. Hear about this engagement between General Travellers family and the family of First Patriarch UpaYoiko snorted. Indeed the Kami are being their normal mischievous selves when it comes to Lumsan she declared in her average deadpan voice. She then sighed. Having interacted several times with Moroboshi Atarus wouldbe wife the adopted native of Maizuru could only shake her head. There were times Redet Lum DID seem the right sort of future wife for the grandnephew of Yonagas junior navigation officer. She was eager to learn new things quite open and accepting willing to make friends and loyal to a degree that any samurai trained in the classical virtues would find admirable.But...then there were the problems...For all Lums many virtues she had a considerable number of faults. The warlords daughter from Onishuto was clingy to her husband in a way that seemed pathetic at times and borderline obsessive in others especially in the face of Atarus more than understandable reluctance to commit to something so lifealtering as MARRIAGE at such an early age. Lum also felt it her personal domain to decide EVERYTHING that happened in Atarus life an attitude that would NEVER lead to a happy marriage in either the short or long term. Her na√Øvet√© when it came to Terran cultural and social norms tacked onto a barely disguised sense of social superiority given her native race had advanced to the stars over a millennia ago carving out a considerable sector of territory for themselves during that time period rubbed people the wrong way especially the man she wished to wed. And she had issues controlling her bioelectrical manipulation powers the two incidents which saw Tomobiki High School forced to close for major repairs in early May and near the end of June were mute testament to that.Then there was the last issueMoroboshi Ataru himself.This might make next week a little dicey Yvonne noted.Yoiko grimaced. Aye my friend. While the arrival of this Rupa fellow he actually might be on that ship orbiting over the equator at the latitude of T≈çky≈ç as we speak Lumsans engagement will provide the necessary distraction in case she feels the urge to use her spacializer to probe back in time as Tarikosan and Atarusan have long feared. Still it shouldnt be too distracting from the primary task before us come next Friday. She shook her head. People in Tomobikich≈ç havent begun to question the decision to shift Labour Thanksgiving celebrations to the following Monday in fact.Yvonne gazed at her. The change of dates for a major holiday like the Japanese version of Labour Day would have tongues wagging in America. Considering that for a moment she then crossed her arms. That brainwashing that was unleashed last year to make everyone believe Tariko had lived here as Ataru all this time in lieu of being on Yiziba doing her casting drive you meanHai the larger woman affirmed with a curt nod. I did hear from Rinrinsan that Margo Blackdono will be here by tomorrow evening to commence the decrystallization of the barrier field around the town to a safer ruby mesonium format. That should allow people within Tomobikich≈ç to recover their true memories. Combine that at the same time with a worldwide Infinite Wave by Kasuga Ayumudono and ANY citizen of the states of the Galactic Federation especially those who might still adhere to that disgusting one true faith from Phentax Two will be swept off the planet once that bomb is pulled out of the Tomobiki Ginza and propelled through Suzumiya Haruhidonos time warp to when we participated in that wonderful day over Phentax Twelve humiliating the rimrae umale like we did.Yvonne whooped with laughter. That had been the best day she had enjoyed in her new life as a human woman with cosmiclevel metahuman powers gifted thanks to the genius of one Elizabeth Wakefield of Sweet Valley. Hunting and killing Grimm on Remnant in detail had been nothing compared to blasting apart Kashinclass battlewagons and Tsubasaclass star destroyers at over a million kilometres range guided by a form of clairvoyance which seemed to the reborn Grey Ghost of World War Two akin to her manytimes successful air group doing its deadly work across the Pacific Theatre of Operations.And with what Liz T√°nja Chap√°eva and Tsuruya Rumiko have set up at the Ceres orbit line...The two shipgirls both of whom served as flagships to senior naval officers who were utter geniuses in naval planning Yoikos formation commander Admiral Fujita Hiroshi had been the man in charge of preparing for Operation Z and would have commanded the attack had Fate not trapped his flagship in Sanowan Yvonnes effective adopted dad Fleet Admiral William Halsey had been the Americans seaborne version of General George S. Patton in the Pacific War exchanged mirthless smiles...Lumchan will be heartbroken...Both perked then turned as a young Oni boy floated down to join them. Little One Yoiko called out as Redet Ten lowered himself to the veranda while Yvonne poured tea. You know this must happen.He looked at her then nodded. Hai...still...What happened Yvonne asked.A deep breath answered the adopted VirginianNew Jerseyan. Lumchan called and told me about this creepy guy who claims shes gotta marry his greatgrandson Ten stated before nodding as he took the offered cup of tea. Sipping from it he looked into the darkening sky overhead. Shes going to stay with her parents and come back by Mondays classes but she wanted me to keep Ataru here in town. Of course when I told her that he was with his sisters... He shook his head as his eyes teared. She looked so hurt... Sniffing he then nodded thanks as the American handed him a handkerchief.An approving smile crossed the adopted native of Maizuru and Nagoya the birthplace of her admiral. That you feel so much for your cousin speaks of how honourable you are young Ten. Her grey eyes twinkled as the firefighters son from Onishuto awked at that compliment before she sipped her tea. Still think hard of this What did your cousin NOT understand when she asked you thatTen considered that for a moment before he slumped. I dont know Onƒìchan...Betrayal Ten.He jolted before gazing wideeyed at Yvonne. Why...The reborn second of the Yorktownclass took a deep breath. Your cousins a very lucky lady she mused before gazing intently at him. She has very loving parents has many friends and grew up in a very nurturing environment. She gave him a knowing look. Did AtaruSilence fell before Ten slumped again. Not really...Indeed Yoiko cut in. All he and she has known for the past decade and more rising from this sad town is heartbreak and betrayal. Ignoring Tens wince the seventh carrier nodded towards the Moroboshi home next door. The initial betrayal over eleven years ago. What type of mother would say something like THAT to a six year old child especially on his BIRTHDAY True Atarusans removal from Earth by Ayonesan was quite extreme in and of itself but his birth mother should have realized from the start that doing that to a child would have driven him out of the house sooner or later. She sneered. Then came the response from that woman to her childs disappearance. She did NOTHING. She doesnt swallow her pride and ask her motherinlaw who had connections to the right people among the Zephyrites and the Noukiites to locate Atarusan to get her surviving child back home. What does she do She bemoans the fact that he abandoned her wishing constantly that she never had him which implies she wished she never wanted the child she DID love and effectively marked time with her husband. And when Atarusan now Tarikosan learned of that...Screw Baka Aho Ofukuro. Ive got a life to live Yvonne finished.Hai Yvonnesan. Well said my friend. The taller woman then focused directly at Ten. Then came the THIRD betrayal Tarikosan would suffer. Here she held up three fingers in emphasis. What happened to Tarikosan over the last decade was learned by whatever agency decided to play with the memories of all within Tomobikich≈ç to make all seem normal here. No doubt some precognitive or seer foresaw your uncles coming. Never ONCE was Tarikosans selfappointed mission to protect Earth from alien intrusion taken into consideration. She was BRAINWASHED made to FORGET all those who could have stopped such an invasion with insane ease then put back into a house she had fled ten years before to be subject to the SAME abuse that made her flee that home in the first place. Even worse with her grandmother dead her mother now was infected by the sin of greed to seize what Nagaiwakaisan left for her grandchild for her own use leaving Tarikosan destitute.Fourth betrayal Miyake Shinobusan. Hai that she was the ONLY one in Tomobikich≈ç who still hoped Tarikosan was well speaks very highly of her inner soul her karma is quite enhanced by such actions. When she fell victim to the brainwashing it was more than understandable that she would latch onto Atarusan and pursued a relationship. Hai his behaviour at that time was boorish to the extreme. But despite her own good heart why didnt Shinobusan question what was making him act this way Here Yoiko shook her head. She didnt. She convinced herself she was doing him a favour by being his wouldbe lover while inwardly longing for someone else...who came in the form of Mend≈ç Sh≈´tar≈çsan when she decided she didnt wish to continue fighting Lumsan. Even so she still felt herself possessing the right to judge Atarusan as if she still desired his hand in marriage which transformed her from a friend into yet another MONSTER no different than his own mother.And then...the final betrayal.Tens eyes widened. Lumchan...Hai young Ten Yoiko coolly declared. Tarikosan DID see your cousin as the one true friend she had in Tomobiki until her memories were restored thanks to Ayumusan and Koyomisan on her birthday. Perhaps if Yiziba was not a factor in things Tarikosan Atarusan might seek Lumsan out as his future wife. But Atarusan became Tarikosan. And the price for being allowed to become what SHE desired to be came at a hideous cost to her very soul Little One. As Ten gulped on hearing the dirgelike moan enter Yoikos voice the seventh carrier held up a finger. Her soul split in half ultimately by Lumsans na√Øvet√©. One half allowed to become what her true mother hoped she would become...and the other made POWERLESS. With his karma wounded so hideously and forced by circumstance to become a living target to ensure your cousins most faithful did not take all of EARTH hostage with that bomb in the Ginza Atarusan became quite angry at what had befallen him. Her eyes narrowed.And the path once taken by the FortySeven R≈çnin became his inspiration.Ten gargled. Shortly after the existence of shipgirls were revealed in August the transformed Yonaga came to Tomobiki with Moroboshi Ky≈çsuke to publicly meet with his famous grandnephew. As the usual suspects who hovered around Ataru like vultures learned to their painful cost that the seventh carrier of Operation Z saw them as nothing more than eta because of their past behaviour with Ky≈çsukes grandnephew and Atarus wife learned there was no way that she could hope to combat someone blessed by Earths oldest sentient being the three million yearold emperor of the Arctic nature spirit known among Russian magicals as T√∫ndra Redet Ten took to It≈ç Yoiko like he had done with Sakuramb≈ç Sakura when they met months earlier. Yoiko reciprocated after learning Ten was no longer afraid of the Scary People taking the lad under her wing to teach him some of the classic Japanese virtues that he could use to help mould himself as he advanced into adulthood.In doing so she introduced him to the story of the Ak≈ç Vendetta of 170102.That was the tale of fortyseven warriors serving Daimy≈ç Asano Naganori of Ak≈ç who after a retainer in old Edo effectively saw their master commit ritual suicide in the wake of being tricked into drawing a sword within the court of Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi were made r≈çnin masterless samurai then were forced to live destitute after the Asano lands were seized. However unknown to all around them those warriors loyalty to their lord NEVER abated making them come together a year later to put the man who effectively saw Naganori die Kira Yoshinaka to the sword. And then knowing they had directly defied the decrees of Sh≈çgun Tsunayoshi concerning potential revengeseeking on Kira even if every tenet of Bushid≈ç loudly DEMANDED such vengeance be sought fortysix of them committed ritual seppuku to join their master in Eternity the last was spared as he had been dispatched to alert authorities to the intended actions of his comrades not being involved in Kiras death.He wont KILL her... Ten then eeped.Yoiko shook her head as a weary look crossed her face. No Little One. Fortunately the influence of the Trickster of the Show is still strong within Atarusans wounded soul. She pointed at his chest. But what he WILL do if something in the next week or so sets him off is totally CRUSH your cousins spirit that she herself might welcome death. Remember those romantic childrens stories about the Maidens of Aruka you taught me after I took you to the Kabukiza to watch the Ch≈´shingura As the firefighters son nodded she lowered her hand. You young Ten must be strong for your cousin in such a trying time. For Atarusan will NOT bend anymore to Lumsan or anyone else in this town.Pray that if the Conservator does see him Gifted in the next week Atarusan does not become a heel.Ten gulped as Yvonne shook her head while a hollow fall wind flowed past them... To Be Continued... WRITERS NOTES This story is another attempt at writing something concerning the Yizibajohei pronounced y…™zib…ëÀêwo ähe…™ in the International Phonetic Alphabet which I first introduced in The Doctor Is In storyline when the late Anime Addventure website was active. For those who dont know about these beings think of the Levramites from Jim Valentinos parody comic maxiseries normalman and you get the general idea though my interpretation isnt meant as a parody there are dark implications as to how the Yizibajohei are governed. For those continuity buffs this story is set neat the end of the Yatsura and Ranma manga series starting at the Boy Meets Girl storyline as indicated above in the former and the Saffron arc in the latter during the time of HalfBlood Prince in the Harry Potter timeline near the start of the third season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer the fourth season of The West Wing and during the second year of high school as the characters of Azumanga Dai≈ç experienced. For those personages from World Wrestling Entertainment their timeline is the same as it was in real life.As Ive done before when Ive included Yatsura characters in my stories the influences of Mike Smiths and my maxiseries The Senior Year are heavy including in this are the names Ive devised for Yatsura characters like the members of Lums Stormtroopers. Of course comments about other series and characters included in this story will be referenced to in these notes for your convenience.A big nod of thanks to Regina Magia Dr. Tempo 17th Immortal and DestyNova at the Questionable Questing website for inspiring this story and writing omake and side stories for it. I also acknowledge The Sage of Toads whose stories Sempai and Sensei helped inspire certain elements of this storyline.And now for this chapter...The first part of this story is a reflection of events shown in the fifth Yatsura movie The Final Chapter based on the final story arc of the manga Boy Meets Girl manga chapter s 356366 as they would occur in the universe of this story. The teaser scene occurs just prior to the dream Redet Lum has about her encounter with Patriarch Upa...just before Onsen Mark wakes her up and gets zapped for itTranslation list and source language Teitoku Admiral Japanese Shireikan Commander Japanese Sanowan Sano Bay Japanese Hagakure Hidden Under the Leaves Japanese Go Rin no Sho Book of Five Rings Japanese HWF Hyperwarp Frequency English abbreviation Cha An alien version of the Japanese suffix honorific chan used on worlds like Uru Vosian Yamato damashii Japanese spirit Japanese Taish≈ç Navy admiralArmy generalAir Force air chief marshal Japanese Rimrae umale Copycat same Yizibajohei Ofukuro Literally honourable sack archaic way of addressing ones mother Japanese Eta Literally abundance of filth a crude term used for what are called burakumin hamlet people today Japanese Kabukiza Literally theatre of Kabuki Japanese Ch≈´shingura Treasury of Loyal Retainers Japanese Taisa Navy captainArmy colonelAir Force group captain Japanese Ch≈´sa Navy commanderArmy lieutenant colonelAir Force wing commander Japanese.The list of minor characters in Tomobiki High School introduced hereTsuruya Rumiko is my name for the girl who resembles Takahashisensei that appears in the early stories of the manga such as Food Fight manga chapter 106. Her being a lesbian is my creation though meant as a comment towards the obsession girls in the class have for Mend≈ç Sh≈´tar≈ç.Inu Chigaiko is my own character first appearing in The Senior Year story Darlings Secret Date. She is a character meant to comment on how things go in Class 24 in later uses I have her suffer a terrible curse thanks to the Red Cloak who appeared in the story named after him manga chapter 41.Marubeya Momoe and Gekasawa Kumiko both appeared in the manga story Even Though I Wait For You manga chapter 26. Their family names are my invention.T≈çno Mizuki and Fujiwara Aya are characters from the Super Real Mahjong adult arcade games released around the turn of the millennium these two appeared in the P5 version of the series. More about them will be revealed in future chapters.Now for the shipgirls appearing here an explanation...Starting with side stories at SpaceBattles and Sufficient Velocity I called A Girls Name I began introducing normal human names for shipgirls. I eventually took that concept into The Seventh Shipgirl and the first drafts of this story to ensure all reborn warship kami receive human names. The rules I apply for such names varies from nation to nation but there are some themes. Also note that all warships in the universe of my stories have ship prefixes such as HMCS Her Majestys Canadian Ship or vessel type prefixes such as GC Grand Cuirass√© large battleship the French Navy term for dreadnoughts. Even more hull and pennant numbers are applied to all warships hull classification codes and pennant superior numbers are in the native operational language of the service in question.Thus introduced here from JapanIt≈ç Yoikotaisa DNTKDNTR Tenn≈ç Heika Gunkan Yonaga KB11 Chihaya Annetaisa DNTK Tenn≈ç Heika Gunkan Kong≈ç JS5 Shimosuwa Tamiyotaisa DNTK Tenn≈ç Heika Gunkan Tenry≈´ KJ44 Shimosuwa Tadakotaisa DNTK Tenn≈ç Heika Gunkan Tatsuta KJ45 Fukushima Fujikoch≈´sa DNTK Tenn≈ç Heika Gunkan Fubuki KK156The ship prefix Tenn≈ç Heika Gunkan means Warship of His Majesty The Heavenly Sovereign and is abbreviated as THG in Latin script this prefix is used no matter which Imperial armed service the ship belongs to. The Imperial Navys official title is DaiNihon Teikoku Kaigun Navy of the Greater Japanese Empire abbreviated DNTK their counterparts in the ground services are the DaiNihon Teikoku Rikugun Army of the Greater Japanese Empire abbreviated as DNTR. Hull codes noted on here include the following KB K≈çk≈´ Bokan Aircraft Carrier JS Juny≈ç Senkan Battlecruiser KJ Keijuny≈çkan Light Cruiser KK Kuchikukan Destroyer.And from the United States...Captain Yvonne Claudia Swanson USN United States Ship Enterprise CV6I honestly dont believe that Yvonnes hull code needs to be explained here.Of course Chihaya Anne THG Kong≈ç Shimosuwa Tamiyo THG Tenry≈´ Shimosuwa Tadako THG Tatsuta and Fukushima Fujiko THG Fubuki all resemble their Kantai Collection interpretations. It≈ç Yoiko THG Yonaga resembles the Warship Girls interpretation of her sister It≈ç Shizuka THG Shinano save for black hair fringed in grey grey eyes and standing a head taller than her sister Yamatoclass ships. And Yvonne Swanson USS Enterprise resembles the fan art done of her by RealMBW as shown on Danbooru at entry 1705675. As always major thanks to Sasahara17 the author of the seminal KanColle fanfiction story The Greatest Generation for the Grey Ghosts human name such was the inspiration for all human names for shipgirls to follow.As for the story of Yoiko and her crew the best explanation is contained in the writers notes for Part Two of the side story Giftings Dreams and Nightmares.The use of the proper name N«ö ShƒÅnp√∫ for Shampoo of Ranma 12 is my creation.The crew of the starship USS Enterprise SCV6 are based on the crew of USS Dallas SSN700 as they appeared in Tom Clancys The Hunt For Red October both Bartolomeo Mancuso and Ronald Jones would play minor r√¥les in sequel stories of that series. The 27MC short for 27 Main Circuit system is the main shipboard communications link to a warships sonar and radar control spaces.,Mature,Alternate Universe - Canon DivergenceAlternate Universe - Modern Setting
https://archiveofourown.org/works/19427545,Time and Time Again,The Winchester family was a force to stay away from. Each member carried with them a very long list of creatures they destroyed along with an endless list of everything they would do to make sure their loved one was safe and alive. It all started with John Winchester the father. When he realized his eldest son Dean was on his deathbed after an eighteenwheel tractortrailer slammed into their 67 Chevy Impala John sold his soul for his sons revival. And when the youngest siblings Sam spinal cord was severed by a comrade Dean sold his soul with only one year to live. Though both Sam and Bethany the middle child failed at any attempt to save their brother Dean came back with the help of angels. Yes angels Gods warriors. This shouldnt have come to a surprise to the siblings after everything that had already been through but Castiel was too real to not believe in.For years the Winchester siblings had been through hell and back. But no matter what happened to them Bethany continued to stay neutral between her brothers. Usually its what the middle child would do but when it came to the men their fights were like World War III eventually she had to pick a side. The worst fight was when their father and Sam had their destructive argument. Both Dean and Beth were on their fathers side leaving Sam to fend for himself. Shed never admit it but Bethany admired the way Sam stood up to their father and made a new normal life for himself. The life of a hunter wasnt a choice it was forced upon them. If it were up to her Bethany would have had the cookiecutter life. A normal life with normal people a normal job and normal friends. But no matter how hard Bethany tried to live that life the supernatural always fought back in. It also didnt help how her older brother needed assistance finding their father after mysteriously disappearing.Sucking Sam back into the life was a fight the older brother and sister had for weeks. Dean continued with his irrational argument stating Sam needed to help because it was their father what if something happened Bethany however fought for Sams normalcy as much as she could but eventually lost the fight. Though countless good came out of Sam rejoining his siblings there were too many losses great people caught in the crossfire. But that was the life. Some people died and some people got saved. And that wasnt any different when present night came.Nightfall came earlier than any of the siblings had expected. The day was spent driving along the macadam road following white and yellow lines while listening and singing along to Black Sabbath. Both Sam and Bethany grew tired of the cassette mostly because it was about the millionth time they were listening to the album but also due to the siblings becoming extremely tired. Dean Winchester pulled into a motel parking lot as he watched his little sister yawn in the rearview mirror. Her light eyes brightened up with the thought of sleep. Lately the only shuteye she received was half an hour here and if she was lucky an hour there. The brunettes mind was always buzzing wildly with unimportant thoughts. Being the middle child the mediator to the Winchester brothers was not an easy occupation. On top of hunting demons vampires werewolves and recently Leviathans Beth forcefully played referee increasingly in the recent weeks.The motel room looked like every other they had conned their way into. Two uncomfortable beds one television the brothers would eventually fight over one table which would be occupied by Sam and his trusty laptop and one bathroom that looked and smelled like it hadnt been cleaned in over a month. All these charming qualities had gone unnoticed by the Winchester family since the trio had grown accustomed to them. The only difference to the motel room this time around was Sam walking toward the bed and Dean shuffling to the table. This the sister found odd but said nothing as she made her way to the unoccupied bed. Throwing her bag by the foot Beth fell onto the mattress and let out a soft sigh. Every muscle in her body thanked her for the opportunity to stretch out but her mind had a different plan. Sorrow will not change your shameful deeds do well best someone else has better seen. Lyrics from Evil Woman buzzed through her mind as she lay still with her head on the rock hard pillow.Just as Beth felt herself slowly slip into dream world she was woken by the sound of an obnoxious cellular tone. Her little brother reached for the phone as Beth groaned rolling over. Whatever it is it better be important she mentally threatened throwing the blanket over her face. It seemed sleep was never on the poor womans side and because of that she was getting crankier by the day. As she tiredly sat up she was met with Sam on the phone and Deans face illuminated by the computer screen. Boy dont you look like sleeping beauty Dean commented earning an explicit finger from his sister. Wiping the sleep from her eyes Beth watched her young brother.As Sam spoke to Sheriff Mills on the other line both Dean and Beth grew interested in the conversation when he agreed something was our kind of number. Averting her gaze to Dean the siblings shared a shrug before turning their attention back to Sam. Closing his phone he announced a possible case offered by the Sheriff. She had to admit Beth found it weird then again her entire life was societys definition of weird.I feel bad we didnt get her anything Dean replied sounding more sarcastic than sincere. Beth couldnt blame him Bobbys death took a toll on all of them. But she knew Dean was taking it harder than anyone. Losing his best friend then father figure Beth didnt understand how he was still walking and talking.I cant believe Im about to say this but I hope youre watching cartoon smut. Stopping midstand Beth looked to her brothers in disgust.And this is why I wish I had a sister Beth mumbled as she made her way to the bathroom. While Sam and Dean continued their conversation the sister shut the door behind her. Two brothers motel rooms and shitty cars was this the life she was meant for Questions of similar topics have haunted her for years ever since she found out the love of her life was actually a vampire. Four years together and never once did she suspect a thing. That was until her father called her one night claiming he urgently needed her help with Dean. Racing to the location he gave Beth was shocked to see Richard tied up fangs extended. It was Beth who killed her beloved and it was also her decision to join her father and brother in their quest to hunt monsters once again. For a split second Beth wondered what her life would be like if her father hadnt revealed the beast Richard was. Would everyone they ever lost be alive Would Richard Would she even be alive Letting out a strenuous sigh Beth shook her head. I really shouldnt be alone with my thoughts she mumbled drying her hands on her jeans before stepping out of the bathroom.When she crossed the threshold she watched as her brothers finished packing up what little they had. Leaving already Beth inquired disappointment in her voice. Sam answered her while he swung his bag over his broad shoulder while mumbling about a case. But I barely got any sleep the sister protested almost childish.Then you can stay and find your own way there.Fine. Beth let out an aggravated sigh as she walked to the door. Dont get your big mammoth panties in a bunch. In the car Beth was finally able to get some sleep after threatening to destroy all of Deans cassettes. Her light green eyes were revealed to the world after the car had stopped in front of an old abandoned house. Well this looks nice Dean commented. The house looked to have been left in the lurch for years with a fence in front of it requesting for no trespassers. Check round back Sam nodded and they were off again.Once inside the house Beth felt the need to Purell her hands every fifteen seconds. Theres a semifunctioning bathroom and one unranced bedroom. Sam stood in front his siblings a look of disgust on his face.Define semifunctioning and for the love of God do not use the words hole in the floor. Beth had gotten pretty tired of improvising her bathrooms sometimes she wished she was a man through those times. Unfortunately for her Sam didnt respond with words but merely with a proposition of the game rock paper scissors. Already knowing the outcome Beth put her hands up ready to play. The brother and sister looked to Dean as he rolled his eyes. Following his siblings pursuit they began both Sam and Beth winning. Giving a groan Dean walked away as Beth and Sam unpacked their things. Kids playing hide and seek found the body Sam explained opening the case file.Wow. Very King Tut Dean said while looking to the case pictures taking the folder from his brothers hands.Yeah so this is where the witness to the assault lives. Following Sams gaze Beth looked to the half blue painted house. But cops are calling him an unreliable witness. With both his brother and sisters stares on him Sam shrugged. Lets find out.The siblings walked to the front door and knocked patiently waiting for an answer. All three knew the protocol on how to handle interviews with witnesses. Half the time Beth wrestled with the thought of actually getting into the police force so it would be much easier to obtain evidence and information with a real badge but with everything that had happened and her face on the FBIs most wanted the hunter knew the slightly delusional thought would be just that.Almost instantly the door opened revealing a blue eyed darkhaired man lazily wrapped in a blanket. Immediately they introduced themselves as false agents like theyve done for the past couple of years. While the men talked Beth looked around the house looking for anything suspicious. During her inspection Beth listened to the witness automatically concluded he was on some kind of medication she didnt want to assume he was naturally born an idiot. Lucky for the woman the interview only lasted a minute or two more before they were able to walk off.Back at their place of temporary residence Sam researched on his laptop as Dean and Beth searched through books all coming up empty. But little Sammy did find something interesting. Canton Ohio turns out its kind of a hot spot for weird dead bodies. Here are a few news archives. He moved the screen to Dean and Beth. Not exactly reporting mummies but still 1928 three deaths cited as spontaneous combustion. Body is quote shriveled despite no signs of fire. 74 three bodies found with leathery decay. Uh 57 three more. Severe dehydration. But this time one made the front page. Girl named Terry Cervantes found a corpse near her church. Maximizing the picture Beth leaned in to get a better look.Any pattern here other than the location Dean asked as he sat back in his seat drinking a beer.Random vics random years. But they seem to drop in threes.Thats two down one to go. Leaning forward Dean placed his beer on the table before taking the laptop from his little brother. Both Beth and Sam exchanged confused glances.Are you going to look at more anime or are you strictly into Dick now Beth asked with an amused smirk. Dean flashed her a glare before typing away on the laptop. Within mere seconds Dean was able to bring up live local camera feeds shocking his siblings.Howd you do that Sam inquired slightly stunned.Little tutorial from Frank Dean answered with a smile. Dont worry well pretend this never happened. Beth raised a brow at her cocky brother before looking to the screen. Now mummy numero dos was found at the Gas n Sip near Main Street. As he spoke Dean typed and brought up the live broadcasts.You need to teach me that trick Sam insisted before Dean pointed out their guy. Quickly Sam took the laptop away and brought up an old newspaper picture. Comparing the photo and the video feed was almost too easy it was the same person.He hasnt aged a day has he All right if hes been popping up for decades now then somebodys bound to know who he is right Is there any chance Terry is still localIt turned out she was. Terry was a doctor at the local hospital. While Dean and Sam interviewed Terry Beth stayed behind. There were no lights illuminating the room she was laying in and the only sounds she heard were the passing vehicles from the outside world. Lying on her back the woman stared up at the ceiling. Finally she was alone and still she couldnt bring herself to leave. It wasnt like she had very many items to pack to hold her down. No it was her fathers voice in her head hindering her actions. Take care of your brothers Bethany. Without you theyd probably end up killing each other. Family was very important to Beth but the job was starting to be just that a job.She used to love traveling from state to state looking for cases and monsters to murder. Saving people was the pay shed receive and she loved it. But now after losing the love of her life her father various friends Castiel and Bobby she didnt know how much more she could take. For weeks she was planning on leaving mentally battling with reasoning and doubt in her mind. Just packing up her things and putting as much distance between the life and herself seemed like a great idea every time she thought about it. But whenever shed gotten a chance to do so something always stopped her.Bethany Hearing her older brothers voice booming from the lower level brought her thoughts back to reality. Getting to her feet she made her way down the stairs and came to a shirtless Dean. Shielding her eyes Beth held back her distaste.Really Dean she whined walking to the other room.What I need to change he defended annoyed. Besides its not like you havent seen anything before.Yeah thanks for reminding me about that time in Rhode Island note to self scratch my eyes out later. Hearing a laugh from Sams mouth forced her to make a face.Hey at least it wasnt full frontal Dean added as he entered the same room as his sister fully clothed in his hunting clothes.Can we change the topic to oh I dont know what ... you guys found out Beth insisted massaging her forehead with her fingers.Mr. Snider Sam answered with a nod. And we know where he lives.Alright then lets get going Beth suggested clapping her hands together.,Not Rated,Sister!Reader x Dean WinchesterSister!Reader x Sam Winchester

https://archiveofourown.org/works/20874956,Things Left Unsaid,Sometimes the heroes dont win. Sometimes they do. But victory for the living doesnt last forever. And neither for the dead. Henry knew this long before he ever met Abraham. But now the concept rang painfully true as he watched his protege and friend suffer through the last moments of his life. It was terrible. It was sickening. Abe was sprawled out on a bed unable to move while Mary held his hand. She was attempting to comfort him but Henry was unsure if she was even being heard. The scent of blood hung in the air. Now Henry found himself wishing that he could shut out the craving. A wish hed pondered many times before. But his desire remained. He wished he could grieve without the interruption of insatiable hunger. That he could say goodbye to his friend without the terrible blood lust clinging to his possessed soul. The evil that shadowed his every thought. Once again Henry was reminded that no matter how he felt or what he wished that he was still a monster. Abrahams rattling breath stuttered. His grey eyes rolled in his skull the movements not quite controlled but he looked at Henry nonetheless. Henry no longer had a beating heart but his insides still turned at the fear he saw. He couldnt bear to see it. The doctor called upon Mary asking her to step out for a talk. Henry didnt need to hear his verdict to know Abes life was over. There was no way he could possibly hope to recover from such a grave wound. But Mary stood anyway. It was amazing the composure she had. She was shaking Henry could practically smell her dread. But she was holding herself together for her husband. With as much grace as she could summon she left her husband behind. Henry was alone with Abe. He collapsed to his knees beside his friend. Sitting in Marys chair seemed disrespectful. He wasnt his wife. He wasnt family. The way of life Henry got him into destroyed his family. The vampires they hunted destroyed Abrahams only son. Now he would die with no children at his side. Henry burned with guilt. Abe was looking at him expecting something. But Henry didnt know what to say. What could be said There was no comfort to offer. He wouldnt be okay. Abe would die an agonizing death. Henry couldnt ease his pain nor could he give spiritual comfort. He couldnt promise his friend something better beyond or that he would ever see his wife again. There was only one meaningful thing Henry could say to his friend. Ill take care of Mary. Henry promised. She wont run into trouble. Ill keep her safe. The corners of Abes mouth twitched and his gaze seemed warmer. The unsaid thank you hung in the air. Henrys nervous hands fiddled with the edge of the bed sheets while Abe struggled to draw breath. Mortality was cruel and it crushed Abraham. He was paralyzed by the bullet that destroyed him. So weak he couldnt even hold his wifes hand. There was nothing he could do for his friend. But that wasnt true. Henry was uniquely qualified to help Abraham. He was perhaps the only person in America capable of saving the president. Certainly after the Civil War he was the only vampire left with enough power to turn a human. Henry could save him now. Save him from death and pain from the uncertainty that lay beyond the grave where Henry could never follow. He could end this right now. Abe could do nothing to stop him. He raised his wrist above Abes lips ready to do it. But Henry found himself hesitating. It went on for a moment and then another. Longer than Henry intended it to. Abrahams breath was shallow in his chest but distinctly faster than before. He was panicking. Pleading brown eyes met Henry. He thought of his wife. Abe reminded him of her in a lot of ways. They were both strong naive and kind. She couldnt stand to turn away when people were suffering. He shared this with her. It was what made Abraham a great vampire hunter. It was what killed his wife. She couldnt leave when Henry told her to do. They had that in common too. They never listened to him. And innocence. Henry watched his wife die in pain and afraid. Screaming for help he was too weak to provide. Despite his silence Abe was suffering the same way she did. Could he really let another die on his watch like this Especially when he now had the power to save him Again he hesitated. His wife had died a torturous death. But she died a human being. Uncorrupted by the demon that had plagued Henry for centuries. She died innocent. Innocence was rare and fragile. Abe had it. He had a beating heart and a soul. If souls really exist Henry would be tearing it away from him. Replacing it with an evil that urged him even now to drain the life of the friend he wanted so desperately to save. With the look in Abes glazed eyes Henry knew hed never be forgiven if he did it. Mary stood in the doorway with a dark expression. He didnt have to ask what the doctor told her. She looked at him expectantly. She had begged him for his power of resurrection when Willie died. Henrys heart ached for her grieving mother that she was. But it seemed as though she was leaving the choice up to him this time. Her eyes were urgent with a twinge of hope. Hope that disappeared when Henry shook his head. Now her eyes held only tears. She rushed back to her husbands bedside. These were their last moments together. Henry knew that he should leave. He shouldnt intrude on a widows goodbyes. But as he left he turned to his departing friend who smiled gratefully. Another thank you left unsaid.,Teen And Up Audiences,ReincarnationSad with a Happy Endingi am ashamedSelf-IndulgentSlow BurnHurt/ComfortAngstEventual Romance

One day God manifested light from a single thought Let there be light. He liked the light but also appreciated the darkness hed been living in before. He decided to keep them both but divide the two. The light was called Day and the darkness Night. This day was the first day.Next in the spirit of segregation God divided the waters of the Heaven and the waters of the Earth putting the Heaven water above and the Earth water below. Thus ended the second day. On the third day he got creative again. He took all of the waters of the Earth and put them in one place. To fill up the remaining space he invented land. He liked this a lot. He called the land Earth and the previous Earth waters were now called Seas. So he had Heaven the above water Seas the below water and Earth the land in the below. After that on the same day mind you he made it so that Earth yielded plants. These plants he decided should have their own system of selfpopulation whereby they contain seeds to produce more plants of the same species. Thats just what happened plants contained seeds and when able to spread these seeds and enable them to grow fruitfully they successfully made more versions of themselves. The fitter the plant the more that survived. God really liked this system.On the fourth day God was getting bored of all the darkness during the evening so he put some lights up. He put them in the Heaven because it didnt have any land so it could shine down on the Earth. He made two main lights one big one to manage the majority of the light during the day and a smaller one to deal with the relatively low light levels at night. He also put up lots of light patterns to remind himself what day it was and although there had only been four days already so far he devised a system whereby the lights would show patterns years into the future. He was very proud of himself.On the fifth day God created moving life this time animals. Some animals swam in the waters of the Seas and others flew in the waters of Heaven when they werent relaxing on land. The Heavenland animals were called birds and the animals of the Seas were mostly fish but some of them were mammals or crustaceans. God put a magic spell on these new animals a good one making sure that they were under a similar system of reproduction to the plants with the seeds spreading around to make sure there were lots of them.The next day God decided that the Earthland should have more animals than just the birds resting from their swim in Heaven. So he made the Earth bring forth some of its own creatures and he liked them. Then God got even more ambitious. He said Lets make us something like us. This on the sixth ever day was his first mistake. He said Looking after all of these animals is going to be a lot of work. Lets make something like us that can take care of it for us. Well just make a man just like us that will be in charge of all of the animals of the Earth and the fish and everything else of the Seas and the birds up in Heaven. And thats just what he did. He created two men one male and one female just like him. He gave them a similar spell to the land animals but this one was modified to include a clause justifying their claims of leadership over the rest of the life in the Earth and Seas and Heaven. So they were able to reproduce just like the animals making new versions of themselves only they had control over everything else. He also decided who should eat what. To man he gave all of the trees and plants that made fruit and seeds. Everything else went to all of the other animals.Finally God observed everything he had created in the past few days and felt very proud of himself indeed. This should go well he thought. This was day number six.,Mature,Biblical ReinterpretationKing James Version
https://archiveofourown.org/works/46086385,December's War,December would never get used to the cold side of the bed. Just nine months ago there was a warm body there. Nine months ago there was a girlfriend snoring next to them. Nine months ago December had a hero in their arms they felt like Hyacinthus cradling Apollo but by those terms they should have died. Nine months ago. December had a family and a fiance who would wake them up in the middle of the night by kicking the blanket off the bed and using their shoulder as a pillow. Nine months ago the bed was warm. Because Nine months ago Lacey was still alive. Looking back December should have seen it coming. Lacey had been stupidly brave since the day they met. She would put her own life on the line without a second thought but if December so much as sneezed she acted like the world as they knew it would end. December didnt know what was going on around them when the Skinwalker came into the campground on September Sixteenth. They stood off to the side where they could run and get one of the more powerful weapons from the trailer if they needed to thinking how they couldnt get a clear shot with the pistol Victor taught them how to use. When Michael fell off balance trying to use a gun and was also unable to get a good shot at it December stepped forward firing at its kneecaps even though it seemed fruitless. And then there was Lacey running forward and swinging that damn sword effortlessly even though it was practically bigger than her Getting between that monster and her son. And in the same blur of movement December saw its claws rip into their fiance and fired the last rounds in their gun straight into the back of its head. December knew they had either called Michael to them or gone out into the clearing and dragged their stepson away because the next thing they could remember was flying down I64 aimlessly and pulling over to the shoulder when their phone started ringing an unknown number. They had known before they even answered what the nature of the phone call was. They were a doctor They knew as soon as they saw it happen that Lacey likely wouldnt survive her injuries. The clock in the jeep read that it was almost one in the morning as they answered. Victor was on the other end of the call and he only said four words. Those four words ultimately wrecked Decembers life. Lacey didnt make it They didnt cry. They just drove to the diner Freya and Noel hid out at and tried to figure out how to tell Michael. And in the end they didnt have to. When they parked Michael just turned hugged them and said I know she wouldnt want you to be sad. He was acting strong but December could see his shoulders shaking as he made his way to the truck. December had driven back to the forest running through the woods mindless of their own safety. The sight they came to was gruesome. There was a charred body on the campfire and the leaves were soaked and stained with blood. Aimee and Lancelot were screaming at each other in a language they could not identify or understand and Dinadan was between them trying to stop a physical fight by the looks of it. Cannibal was pacing agitated and bleeding. Victor was fidgeting borderline hysterical and there was no sign of Guinevere. December immediately headed for the trail they could see heading into the woods but Victors hands were suddenly on their arms and holding them back from moving. They fought him until Lancelot came up behind them and pinned their arms behind their back. She didnt want you and Michael to see her body he said his voice cracking with a brand of grief that only a parent could experience holding December up as they nearly fell to the forest floor. December upheld Laceys wishes but that didnt stop them from overhearing things. From reading the coroners report. They knew her throat was flayed open and her left arm was partially amputated which made the lie of an animal attack very believable. The coroner that was supposed to take the organs from her body hadnt been able to do anything. Everything except her right lung and liver was too damaged to be transplanted. Even the little bones in her ears were shattered beyond repair. They knew it was gruesome. And then everyone tried to move on. Victor and Freya researched and studied and there were days on end where December wondered if they had moved out or not. Aimee didnt talk to anyone unless it was out of necessity but there was no telling if that was out of guilt or avoidance of what she had done. Lancelot and Guinevere managed to disappear and be there for everyone else at the same time and Michael and Dinadan had becomeWhatever they were. And December managed. They treated wounds allergies and illnesses. They took care of the animals when it was their turn and when they werent working they read books. December hadnt actually sat down and read a book for fun since high school but Isaiah had a library and it served as a good distraction. And when December didnt want to read or anything they learned piano off of youtube. Distractions were best. They never looked at Laceys phone and started buying a lot more weed than usual. And then Michael Dinadan Guinevere and Lancelot left. Aimee had only been able to track them to Dublin Ireland. The reason was questionable. No one could figure out why they went there The note Michael left was vague at best. And then the month went by and they still werent home and they were reported missing. Even Cannibal and Runt were missing. Just when they thought things couldnt get any worse Irish authorities reported their last known whereabouts as Woodburn forest An incredibly rugged terrain. Their faces were all over the news and on April fourteenth the four of them were presumed dead and Decembers world ended all over again. They held on to hope that for some extraordinary unreal reason they were alive somehow but December knew the chances of that were slim. And just like that Decembers family was dead all over again. The parents had been one thing taken out by a faulty engine over the Atlantic their ashes in a bag in a little wooden box. Lacey was in the ground under a willow tree the tombstone engraved with a cynical line from her favorite song that fit her personality a little too much. Michael Dinadan Lancelot and Guinevere were missing along with their pets likely dead and rotting at the bottom of a ravine in the Irish wilderness. December felt alone even though they logically knew they werent. Sometimes they believed that Lacey was around still. It didnt make sense because they couldnt sense her spirit around. Wherever Lacey went she had departed straight away not lingering at all. There was no evidence left of the fight that took place at the campground. The trail Laceys parents had carried her down was overgrown and impossible to find. It was impossible to even see where the campfire was. The only evidence there was of anyone being there was the protection runes in the trees that ultimately proved useless. December couldnt feel that their fiance died there They just knew it happened there. But there were times that December swore Lacey was letting them know she was there in one way or another. December would occasionally start humming Vampires will never hurt you even though they never knew the words well But it was Laceys favorite song. Other times a book would fall off the shelf and the title would remind them of things shed said. And then there was Victor who December shared a wall with. He played guitar and the song he played more than anything else was Peirce the Viels I dont care if youre contagious December and Laceys song. And if that didnt ring around in Decembers head every time they prayed for answers they knew they wouldnt get. Id rather kill the one responsible for falling stars at night. December tried to hold on to faith. They went to the small Baptist church down the street every Sunday and every Wednesday they went to the open chapel to pray and sing worship songs. And while Pastor Jake didnt understand everything and didnt know precisely what happened he knew December lost their fiance and their family and was there to offer what guidance he could. They read their Bible as if their life depended on it Highlighting every last verse that gave them hope and researching the ones that made them worry for Laceys soul. They prayed endlessly never receiving an answer. So they at last went to Freya Named after a Norse goddess but loyal to the same god as December. God wont answer me December said to the immortal one day. Freyas cloudy eyes had looked in their direction blowing a dark curl away from her face. She usually wore her veil around other people Specifically when she knew a man would be present But she went back and forth with December who was nonbinary. Occasionally she wore the veil around them but more often than not she didnt. December just took it as her way of acknowledging that she understood and respected December not being a man or woman. Yaweh listens to everyone sometimes he just doesnt give the response youre looking for Freya said. The vast majority of the time December had no issue believing that seeing as Freya had met Yaweh in person and numerous other gods. Freya I have been asking him about Lacey for nine months begging Him to give me a sign shes okay That she made it all the way through. I dont even care what pantheon shes inI just want to know that my wifes okay they had said. Freyas face immediately fell into a look of sympathy and grief. Try asking Satan Hes moresocial for lack of a better term she said with a shrug. December knew Freya interacted with the spirits from the pantheon while only worshipping the god but they still hadnt expected that to be her first answer. Hes the embodiment of evil December said only for Freya to shake her head. Hes not the embodiment of anything. Hes the god of free will and a punisher of evil Freya said. December shook their head. ButBut what about the whole put no other gods before me thing they asked in confusion. Double meaning. We arent supposed to put anything before Him but were also not supposed to worship any other gods. Theres nothing about not reaching out to other dieties for their advice or assistance when you cant get through to Yaweh. He understands and frankly he doesnt even need an apology. Freya told them. December didnt feel entirely convinced but Freya also wasnt the type of person who would lie for any reason. But her knowledge did little to outweigh Decembers upbringing. Still I dont want to talk to the devil Freya. Especially not about my dead wife they said. Freya shrugged again. Then dont. Id suggest starting with the main dieties in the Greek and Slavic pantheons. They take in the most souls. After that seek out the fates to find out if she was reincarnated. After that youre just going to have to start reaching out to dieties. Find out where she is If thats what you want to do to get your peace. she told them. And so after a long apology December reached out to Zeus with a candle during a thunderstorm. When he couldnt answer them December set up a temporary altar for The Fates. They were cryptic with the pendulum that they borrowed from Aimee until December at last got an answer. A map of Ireland addressed to Isaiah in the mail with Mag Mell written on the back. A little research told them that was where heroic spirits were placed in the Irish pantheons afterlife in Tir Na Nog. December knew they should have felt glad Happy even that they now knew where Lacey was. Knew that she was safe and thriving for the first time in her whole life likely. But instead all it did was cause the trip Michael took to Ireland to make too much sense.,Explicit,WarbattlesFound FamilyCannibalismMoralityDemigodsI'm so sorryBook 3part of a seriesLost and FoundCharacter of FaithIt wasn't Lancelot's weekend with the braincellLGBTQ Character of ColorImplied/Referenced Racismthere's no slurs since I'm white and don't feel comfortable writing those wordsJust be aware that someone is pretty racist to DecemberEating Disorder/Disordered Eatingit's not graphic but it's thereProtective DecemberTrans Male Character
https://archiveofourown.org/works/38542450,Wrong Side of the Bed 1 [Mistress/slave] [fsub21] [TFdomme3242] [lesbian] [PTSD] [historical fantasy] [plot],This is a work of FICTION made by and for adults. The following chapter includes depictions of trauma cutting minor bleeding and unintentional suicide. Reader discretion is advised.As the waning moon rose in the near dark of twilight a young woman turned her head swiftly towards a faint glow in the distance disturbing her frizzy ginger locks. As she peered through the thick brush of the pine forest the dim light of the setting sun barely let her make out torches and flickering red flames followed by the distant shouting of men.No How are they inside the ward Elvas eyes widened while her heart stopped as she dropped her foraging basket. Turning swiftly Elva sprinted to her cottage hidden only a little further in the woods. The trees and branches seemed to grab her as she ran snagging her dress and scraping her cheeks while rocks stabbed into her feet with every other step.Just moments later Elva spotted the wooden hut she breathed a sigh of relief before her foot caught on a root throwing her to the forest floor and knocking the wind from her with a huff. As she raised her head in a daze Elva opened her eyes to see the cottage in a blur before coming into focus after a moment.Elva grimaced as she grabbed at the grass and pulled herself back onto her feet to finish her flight trying her best to disregard the pain in her toes. Practically running into the wooden frame Elva threw the door open before quickly closing it behind her as she crossed the threshold.Her trembling legs could no longer support her and Elva fell to the dirt floor in tears sobbing as fear overtook her mind. M√≥ra help me Curling her knees up to hug them Elva wept into her skirt as she remembered her late grandmother. The scorching fire that carried her screams away tickled Elvas skin while the shouts of the hunters that cheered on her demise deafened her ears. Dread filled her mind of the men with torches finding her too and meeting the same horrific fate of ten summers past.After a few moments Elva willed herself to stand up slowly and wipe the tears away from her eyes. I Im not safe here any more Elva sullenly thought as she made her way to a small table of polished pine where her grandmothers grimoire sat on an oak pedestal. As she opened the cover of the leatherbound book she carefully read over the descriptions of the spells in her native tongue and the strange glyphs that followed.Wards theyre already through the ones in place she thought aloud as she flipped through the pages. Divination not that I can even read the rites. Potions no. Healing no Where is it Elva began to flip more desperately through the pages until she eventually found what she needed.Finally Summoning The last passages of the grimoire detailed how to summon immortals spells that her grandmother had forbidden her from attempting. Im sure whatever could go wrong couldnt be worse thanElva shook her head to clear her thoughts before she tried to focus on the details of the spells and the specific warnings of signing a contract with demons. I guess Ill just have to be careful Lets see Fairies they dont sound helpful but maybe better than nothing. The rite is oh thats her eyes darted across the glyphs trying desperately to understand the syntax and flow. Its only the first one and it looks so complicated I dont know if I can perform that she forlornly thought as she read the details and the complex rite she had to recite.Next page I guess. Elves a little better friendlier sounding at least. What about the her breath caught as she tried to understand the rite. I I dont even know how to read some of these glyphs Her head fell as she realized the futility of the task shed set herself to complete. Before the tears welling in her eyes could fall Elva clenched her hands and wiped her eyes with her sleeve.You can do this You have to After taking a deep breath Elva turned to the next page. Vampires No I Elva raised a hand to her mouth as she struggled to read the description of vampire blood contracts. I cant sign that I might die just thinking about it sick at least she decided not to read the rite before Elva hurriedly flipped to the next page.Demons she whispered as she recalled the warning M√≥ra gave. Please be helpful at least Elva silently hoped as she began to read about the infamous immortal. Incubi are males succubi are females Contracts consume the magical and physical energy of those they contract through carnal acts she blinked twice as her breath caught in her throat her chest began feeling warm. What would an incubus As her cheeks flushed Elva thought about how lonely the last few years were the feelings and needs she started experiencing that were never satisfied on her own.Suddenly Elva noticed how hot her face and chest felt and realized her mind had wandered from her task. After shaking her head and clapping her cheeks lightly Elva looked down again at the open grimoire. Okay the rite Thats not too hard actually. Elva breathed a sigh of relief as she quickly glanced over the rest of the spell. Okay components I have all these on hand. Sigil I can draw that. Finally I found something useful. What are my other optionsElva turned the page only to find that the sheet was blank. She blinked twice before her breath caught. Wait four summons Elva quickly flipped to the next page as her breath became ragged. Thatthat cant be The next page was blank as were the next few until she reached the back cover. There cant be just four Maybe I missed one she flipped the pages backward. No Elva paused as she reached the previous section detailing healing spells her hand shaking as she turned the page forward again.Four summons and I can only perform one of them. The one that has a warning specifically against of course Elva glanced at the door to her small cottage. The walls felt so close as Elva turned her head and the small gaps in the door almost seemed to glow with fire. Her heart stopped while her eyes widened before she shut them and turned away in horror. Theyre here her thoughts turned to panic while her legs trembled before her eyes peeked open again. The glow was gone save for the faint moonlight trickling in.Ill take my chances Elva thought as she turned the page back to the last summoning. Demons it is then she whispered as she began to study the spell and retrieved the components she needed from the nearby shelves and bottles. Five candles and cats eyes around the sigil feather of a dove two sprigs of rosemary lock my hair and virgin blood for the sigil.Having collected the remaining materials at the altar Elva picked up a small knife from the base of the pedestal holding the grimoire. Mine should work I guess Elva thought as she trimmed a few short hairs from her waistlength curls to set aside. Her hand trembled as Elva held it before her. For a moment Elva stared with unsteady eyes and ragged breaths at her finger before Elva slowly raised the edge to her fingertip.Its just a prick she thought as she slowly pressed the knife into her skin failing to draw blood at first. Come on she whispered as she gritted her teeth struggling to pierce her flesh until her trembling hand slipped and pulled the knife across her skin.Ah Elva sharply exclaimed as she dropped the knife she clenched her hand and closed her eyes tightly to dull the pain. Blood trickled down her hand as her finger burned in searing agony. Oh II didnt mean to cut so deep. She took a few moments to collect herself and calm her breathing. The sigil Elva she thought as she pried her eyes open looking over the design and drawing it out on the smooth table with her bleeding finger.There Elva said as she finished and walked to the shelves to fetch a wrapping and stop the bleeding. Ow she couldnt help but exclaim as she secured the bandage around her finger and tied it shut. Elva clenched her hand one last time trying to avoid looking at the blood collecting on the dressing. Okay she said as she looked over the altar and placed the components in and around the sigil. After a moment Elva began to whisper in Wiccacant followed by the candles bursting into small flames illuminating the altar.That should be everything she said as she nervously examined the arrangement on the table one last time. Now the rite Elva clasped her hands together and closed her eyes before reading the passage. Oh Brigit help me and please let them be gentle.She opened her eyes and began to recite the strange glyphs. As Elva progressed the air in the cottage began to shift around the altar flickering the candles and disturbing the pages of the grimoire. Elva paused for a moment to brace her eyes against the newfound wind before she continued the rite.After Elva spoke a few more words she found a strange glow forming around the sigil. Gradually it overtook the light of the candles as a golden mist began to emit from the components that followed the flowing wind. Finally Elva finished the rite and watched as a heavy glistening fog burst from the sigil and began to fill the cottage. Oh please tell me this is normal Elva desperately thought as she closed her eyes waiting for the everbrightening glow to abate and the wind to cease.,Explicit,Alternate Universe - BDSMBDSMSuccubi & IncubiDemonsAlternate Universe - Succubi & IncubiDemon SexHellWitchesWitchcraftAlternate Universe - FantasyAlternate Universe - WitchcraftMagicAlternate Universe - MagicFemdomBondageLGBTQ ThemesLGBTQ Female CharacterLGBTQ CharacterTrans Female CharacterTrans CharacterTransgenderLesbian SexLesbian CharacterAlternate Universe - SlaveryMistressPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder - PTSDSlow RomanceMaster/PetMaster/SlavePet NamesSadismMasochismDominatrixPheromonesAphrodisiacsImplied/Referenced SuicideImplied/Referenced Drug UseTransphobiaChildhood TraumaPsychological TraumaMiddle AgesDemon SummoningRisk Aware Consensual KinkConsensual SexExplicit Sexual ContentExplicit ConsentExplicit LanguageSubspaceAftercarePast Domestic ViolenceInfrequent Graphic ViolenceInterviewsContractsCollarsSlaveryAnal PlayScents & SmellsTelepathy

https://archiveofourown.org/works/50222629,The Bible But Bad,Jens Cis 1In the beginning God yeah him decided she wanted to be productive So she just kinda grabbed a whole bunch of lumpy space lumps and went WABOOM And created the Heavens and the earth. The earth was all lonely and shit and like SUPER dark. So God was like Nah we cant be having this so she said LIGHTACUS UPACUS THIS BITCHICUS jk she just went Let there be light and the earth was so terrified of this badass bitch that it did There was light and it was pretty chill. Then God went Let there be darkness again And the light was gone. Wait no how about only half the time And so God separated light and dark. She called the day parts day and the not so day parts night.Then god said What the fuck is with this water Then God slapped down some good ol Oxygen to separate that water. There was a lil water above the air and a fuck tonne more below it. She called it Sky Time skip Day 2.God STILL didnt like all this dumbass water. So she slapped down a supersponge she got from Costco and soaked some of that blue shit up. She named this new found land Earth and that other shitty water Sea She then commanded that the earth grow plants and shit so it wasnt so brown The earth being the submissive little thing it was shat out some plants. Some plants will have grains that make food While some more will make plants with seeds that make more food The rest of you will just sit around and look pretty. God gave the plants a gold sticker because she really liked hydrangeas. Good job earthDay 3 rolled around and God said Let there be some lights in the sky so the conspiracy theorists dont wonder where the fuck the light is coming from. Oh plus itll be a good marker when they figure out how time works. She made a huge ball of gas and then a little one made of rocks and lunar lung cancer. She also dumped a bunch of little stars everywhere for aesthetic reasons.Day 4. Lessgo. God decided to dump a bunch of creatures in the sea because she wanted to watch them drown. But they can breathe in the water Fuck She then made birds in the sky because she liked the sky and birds were pretty. She created huge creatures to try and eat the other shittier creatures she put in the ocean and some pretty birds to fly above the sea creatures because fuck those guys. She then said to the birds Now grow in numbers Fill the land with your beauty But the dumb fucking sea creatures thought it was to them. So they started too. God was pissed.And now it was day 5. God said To even it out let there be creatures that walk the earth and may they reproduce. God made wild animals tame animals and crawling animals. and may they all drink the water to try and drain that shit for the water animals. God saw they were mostly good.So day 6. God said Let us make humans in our image and likeness. Let them fucking murder the fish in the sea and rule over the birds in the sky and all of the creatures on the land.So God formed Adam from dust and stole one of his fucking ribs With that she made Eve. AND HONKY SHIT SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL Adam was pretty average though. She then said Look Ive made all these things for you. Ive given you food and a hot bod. Now please Eve. Fuck Adam and show him how strong of a woman you can beIt was day 7. The sky and the earth was finished the humans were happily being human the birds where chirping and the sea creatures were NOT fucking dying how shellfish. She blessed this day and made it a pretty good day for a nap. She went and got her nails done then relaxed and had a snooze.,Not Rated,CreationGardens & GardeningSnakesOh My GodBibleSpoilers for The Bible (Abrahamic Religions)Misquoting the Bible (Abrahamic Religions)Bible Study (Christianity)

Ne fais pas linnocent Gabriel je ne suis vraiment pas dhumeur √† ce genre de jeu le pr√©vint Uriel.

Et pourquoi ce serait √† moi de la chercher Ce nest pas moi qui la perd √† tout bout de champ Bien quil fut √† genoux lexpression que lui lan√ßa alors Michael n√©tait pas tr√®s engageante.

Chaque minute pass√©e augmentait lagacement de Michael et Rapha√´l recula de plusieurs m√®tres tant l√©nergie qui se d√©gageait de son coll√®gue √©tait mena√ßante et il √©tait de moins en moins rassur√©. Rien toujours rien pesta Michael. Je vais chercher parl√† toi va voir dans ce recoin Coin Ils relev√®rent la t√™te en tandem pour d√©couvrir un canard au plumage blanc bient√¥t suivi dun second puis dun troisi√®me puis de quelques autres qui suivaient fid√®lement le premier.Ce n√©tait pas la d√©couverte dune bande de canards qui surprenaient les deux Archanges. Ce n√©tait pas la premi√®re fois quils en voyaient au Paradis et certainement pas la derni√®re ils le soup√ßonnaient et des choses beaucoup plus √©tranges s√©taient d√©j√† produites. En revanche la vue dun canard tenant dans son bec une √©p√©e enflamm√©e l√©tait.Le canard ne semblait nullement perturb√© par les flammes divines qui √©manaient de la lame ou encore par le poids de larme.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/43641643,Legacy of the Moon,Legacy of the Moon Arc I Forbidden End Chapter 1 Prelude to Chaos Around 1100 years ago Bernhard Castle somewhere in presentday Europe The very history of mankind is the witness that in the race of overthrowing each other its been several times that humans have made pacts with otherworldly entities especially the evil ones which dwell in the dark realms of this universe.Walter Bernhard was one such man who researched the powerful entities of Hell in order to become the most powerful person in entire Europe by wiping out all of his rivals and enemies. It was a great misfortune of the entire mankind that he ended up finding out an entity that was beyond the concepts such as dangerous and powerful. He was sealed by the primordial entities in the unknown depths of Hell from almost the beginning of time. Even his very name was erased from history. Hence the only term from which he was mentioned in the ancient books was the Forgotten One.Time passed and soon the entire Bernhard Family got involved in the process all of them worked day and night and finally discovered a dangerous and sinful path to contact the Forgotten One. It was the longawaited night of the new moon on which the Bernhard Family was meant to contact that sealed entity. Hence all of them gathered in the room and began to prepare for the ritual.We have to cross the three major sections of socalled Hell Netherworld it is the place where normally the spirits of the dead dwell Underworld it is the dominion of Lord Hades Tartarus the ancient fiery depths of Hell where souls are tortured endlessly until nothing is left in them to get them ready for reincarnation Walter Bernhard explained to his family with tense expressions.But Father I remember you were talking about a realm known as Naraka what about it Walters son asked him out of curiosity to which he replied Naraka the deepest and endless section of Hell which can dissolve absolutely anything except the light of the soul our destination lies just before its border so theres no need to discuss anything about that place.Now his wife shot the next question And my dear this entity umm Forgotten One it is beyond Tartarus right Walter answered yes he is sealed inside a dimensional rift between Tartarus and Naraka.Now Walters wife brought the container of the blood of one hundred people whom her husband killed in recent weeks and poured all of it on the ground making a huge circle. Walter lied down in the circle along with his wife son and daughter. Then all of them stabbed themselves with a special ancient crystal in the middle of their chest which immediately separated their spirits from their bodies while the souls of those one hundred victims accompanied them.Soon enough the path to Hell opened for them in the form of a circular portal on the ground due to which their spirits immediately fell into the Netherworld but it didnt distract them from the ritual. Some of the souls accompanying them were attacked by the creatures and other souls of the Netherworld but Walters family was still left with enough souls for their protection. When they reached the Underworld Hades guards took 50 souls as an offering to let them pass. However the moment they crossed the boundary of Tartarus the powerful and horrible creatures of Tartarus captured all the souls and began to torture them. In the end only Walter Bernhards spirit left and surprisingly it got pulled towards a platform by the power of none other but the Forgotten One.After that night nobody ever saw Walter Bernhard or his family but within a short period of time Bernhard Castle became the center of the evil which at first began to spread in the surroundings and then slowly reached the far ends infecting everyone in its path be it a human beast or even a wandering spirit. After several years of peoples suffering an order of holy warriors came forward to save mankind the Brotherhood of Light they were committed to Supreme Almighty and pledged to destroy all the evil which was swarming the World of the Living. Brotherhood of Light waged war upon Bernhard Castle that continued for many decades. After a few decades Paradise Utopia of the Angels Archangel Michael was lost in deep thoughts about the chaotic situation in Europe but soon his attention was caught by Archangel Uriel who was approaching his chamber. What are you thinking Archangel Michael She asked. You must be aware of the present scenario of Europe the foolish acts of Walter Bernhard have brought havoc in the lives of millions of humans Archangel Michael replied. Archangel Uriel also felt somewhat saddened for the people and spoke further Yes I know should we intervene she asked in a serious tone while watching Archangel Raphael entering the chamber as well. Arent the Jades already trying to help the humans Moreover if the threat is so huge then why didnt the Gods intervene yet Archangel Raphael asked as soon as he arrived there and asked Archangel Michael before he could have answered her. We cant leave humans at the mercy of Jades because it is not their duty to protect them while we dont know when the Gods are going to consider this evil a threat to mankind perhaps after it wipes out half of the human population Archangel Michael spoke in a strict tone. Gods have a history of coming to the aid of humans after too much is already lost. I feel its not right to rely on them for the protection of mankind especially when the situation is this severe. Archangel Uriel added. Then in my opinion we must intervene before it is too late for the humans. Archangel Raphael muttered.Now Archangel Michael walked away from there and approached Archangel Gabriels chamber. He was also pondering over the same issue all alone. As soon as he noticed Archangel Michael he spoke abruptly You could have summoned me Archangel Michael. You must be aware of the thoughts of all Archangels. So what have you decided Archangel Gabriel He asked him. Archangel Michael you are the chief among us so consider my agreement with whatever decision you are about to make. Archangel Gabriel replied to him.Every being in this universe possesses six levels of life Body the form Spirit the collection of all the thoughts emotions and memories it is the identity Power the energy half of which dwells within our spirit while the rest half in the body Essence it is individuality Soul the base of our existence which holds the eternal divine light within all of us Core the divine thread which binds all five elements into one all of you know this well. Archangel Michael spoke while addressing all three Archangels.Indeed we do. Archangel Raphael replied. Hmm yes. Archangel Gabriel responded as well.Lately I have noticed that three ancient souls are about to take birth in the World of the Living among humans and that too in Europe. So when they will take birth in the World of the Living then we will transfer half of our Essence inside their soul. We will join the Brotherhood of Light bless those remarkable holy warriors fight alongside them and once our mission is complete then we will return to Paradise. Archangel Michael explained to them.As you say Archangel Michael. Archangel Gabriel muttered.Archangel Gabriel when I Archangel Uriel and Archangel Raphael will fall into a deep slumber after losing half of our Essence then you will keep an eye on the world in our absence. The chief of the Archangels said in a serious tone.Indeed I will. He replied with some heaviness in his voice.As time passed one by one Zobek Carmilla and Cornell took birth in the World of the Living with the Essence of Archangel Michael Archangel Uriel and Archangel Raphael respectively. Meanwhile in paradise the three Archangels were lying in a deep slumber after losing half of their Essence leaving Archangel Gabriel behind waiting desperately for the revival of mankind and awakening of the Archangels.The three warriors of the Brotherhood of Light equipped with the Essence of Archangels almost put an end to the rampage of dark forces in the World of the Living but the portion of the Essence of Archangels never returned to paradise. Zobek Carmilla and Cornell were tricked by the evil power to corrupt that Essence and turn it into their power and thats how the three Lords of Shadow came into existence. Now Archangel Gabriel was left with no other option but to repeat the process which Archangel Michael carried out. Moreover a powerful ancient soul was about to take birth in the World of the Living in the upcoming decades.Nobody knew why Archangel Gabriel was counting on that soul so much that he was willing to break the promise he gave to Archangel Michael. With Archangel Gabriel falling into slumber all the Archangels were gone and this was a time of intense danger for the World of the Living all regions where spirits dwell and Paradise itself. It was indeed the prelude to the chaos which was about to devastate the worlds of not just humans but spirits as well and the imprints of this devastation were going to linger for thousands of years. Suggested Music Here we stand by Hidden Citizens YouTube link httpswww.youtube.comwatchvmEGThgEwuMI Around 1000 years ago The western region of Classical Japan Heian Period Several months ago a bizarre and cataclysmic phenomenon shook the entire region. After a massive earthquake strange buildings came out of the ground destroying everything in their place. The appearance of those structures was like that of some ancient kingdom with snakelike designs and patterns. Lava was leaking out of their walls and the ground surrounding those structures. It was a dimensional clash that was purposely done by an immensely powerful demon of hell. His name was Orochi and he was the one who mysteriously appeared in the World of the Living along with his minions castle structures of his lair and an Acolyte of Satan Nergal Meslamstea.Orochi and his army started the genocide of humans and Yokai. Nobody was able to understand the actual purpose behind this atrocity. No Yokai human empire or group was powerful enough to face the Serpent Demons monstrous power. It was also because of the fact that Orochi and his minions were all demons of hell while the difference in the power of an earthly demon and a demon of hell is worlds apart. Although a lot of Yokai and Daiyokais joined Orochi and his army the Daiyokai who loved Midoriko i.e. Magatsuhi was one such being who turned his back on his own kind.However one Daiyokai stood firmly to oppose this massacre. He was none other but Toga also famous by the titles Inu no Taisho and the Great Dog Demon. But when the Dog Demon and his Yokai army couldnt stop Orochi then he received help from the most unexpected source. The famous priestess Midoriko came to aid his efforts along with several other powerful priestesses and remarkable monks. Even after knowing the power of the enemy and the dangers of the war Toga and Midoriko didnt take even a single step back and eventually they received reinforcement from the Jade Empire a kingdom of spiritually advanced and enlightened beings whose capacity was on par with the Gods of Olympus.It was that time when Toga managed to wield a demonic blade from Hell i.e. the sword known as Sounga. The mystics of the Jade Empire made it possible for an earthly demon such as Toga to wield a demonic blade of hell.In the end the combined efforts of Jade Warriors Toga Midoriko Yokai priestesses and monks dominated both Orochi and Nergal Meslamstea. A major portion of the region was freed from the grip of the Serpent Demon army but it still seemed tough to completely eradicate them both. Now the Jade Warriors decided to seal Orochi away along with his kingdom inside a dimensional barrier. However the main hindrance in this path was to continuously energize that barrier so that Orochi cant ever escape. The source of the power of that barrier must remain in the World of the Living forever to keep the Orochi and his army at bay.Then Midoriko sacrificed herself and created the Shikon Jewel with the help of the Jade Warriors by sealing herself away along with an immensely powerful Daiyokai Magatsuhi. The Jade Warriors then sealed Orochi along with his legion castle and other structures of his lair in a dimensional prison and assigned Shikon Jewel as the source of that prisons strength. Priestesses and monks who participated in the war were given the responsibility of protecting the Shikon Jewel forever. It was certain that if anything ever happened to the Shikon Jewel then it would result in the doom of the Feudal Era. Upon listening to the news of Orochis defeat Nergal Meslamstea managed to escape the battlefield with no clue of his whereabouts.This massive war engulfed almost half of World of the Living into a terrible clash of spiritual and demonic energies which was proving to be lifethreatening for almost all the species falling in its range. Infants old and sick beings were slowly losing sanity getting paralyzed or even dying because of this destructive clash. It seemed as if the war may be over but its aftermath would torture humanity Yokai and every creature of the World of the Living for several weeks. Soul Society It had been several months since the Shinigamis were trying to find the hideout of the Quincies so that instead of hunting them down one by one they can wipe them all out at once. However the Lord of the Quincies i.e. Yhwach eventually showed himself along with his powerful Quincy army and sieged the entire Soul Society. It was the point in the history of the Soul Society that marked the beginning of the Quincy Blood War. All the strategies and arrangements employed by the Seireitei for tracking down the Quincies beforehand and preventing them from entering the Soul Society failed miserably. Genryusai Yamamoto and all other Captains had left with no other choice except to fight to the death because it was clear that the Quincies were going to win the war. The main reason behind such a miserable condition of the Soul Society was an Acolyte of Satan whose name was Guido Szandor. All this time Guido Szandor was guiding and aiding the Quincy army due to some unknown reasons.When Genryusai and the remaining Captains were close to their defeat Soul King himself descended from his palace along with the 0th Squad and they proved to be the gamechangers in this battle. The clash of Soul King with Yhwach and Guido Szandor released such powerful shockwaves that didnt just disturb the flow of energy in the Soul Society but also in the World of the Living Hueco Mundo and the entire circle of spirits. This disturbance of energy flow critically weakened not just humans but even the most powerful beings such as the Yokai. Though the Quincy Blood War ended up with the victory of the Shinigamis yet everybody was aware that it was not the ultimate end. Bernhard Castle somewhere in presentday Europe The ongoing war between the Brotherhood of Light and the three lords of shadow was raging ferociously for the past few months and it seemed as if the time for the grand showdown had arrived. The soul for whom Archangel Gabriel waited had already taken birth and grown up to become a powerful man of God and a skilled and fearless warrior. He was up against Carmilla the Queen of the Vampires Cornell the master of the werewolves Zobek the lord of the necromancers and many other creatures of the darkness. His name was Gabriel Belmont and he was exterminating the creatures of darkness one after another without fail. However he was unaware of the fact that a powerful Acolyte of Satan Raisa Volkova was keeping an eye on this battle all this time moreover she was the one responsible for pushing this war to such a colossal scale.Even though the soldiers of the Brotherhood of Light were trying to eliminate every creature of darkness yet thousands of them escaped the war and slowly spread throughout the world. On the other hand Gabriel Belmont proved to be more than a match for the Lords of Shadow and thus both sides were forced to unleash their complete strength. This war resulted in something completely unexpected with Gabriel Belmont ending up absorbing Cornell completely and Carmilla partially while Zobek and Raisa Volkova managed to flee. The dark presence that was lingering on the face of the earth didnt actually get eliminated but it only got transferred to Gabriel Belmont. Now the destiny of this man was uncertain and so was the destiny of mankind.This terrible clash of light and darkness resulted in an eruption of similar destructive energy which emerged from the clash of Jade Warriors and Orochi. The almost entire world was under the grasp of such a devastating energy clash and it was killing the population of living beings in the World of the Living at a scary pace. Moreover because of the slumber of Archangels the Lords of shadow disconnected the World of the Living from Paradise and thus all the spirits of the dead were trapped in the World of the Living with nowhere else to go. The scenario of the World of the Living and all other worlds was looking like that of the times of apocalypse where not just the living beings but even the deceased were bound to suffer.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/47924275,Out of Eden,Blaine woke up on Sunday morning to the sound of rain pitterpattering against the skylight window. Gosh he loved Germany. The fact that it actually rained more than once or twice a year was a refreshing contrast to the weather in Mesa. And springtime it seemed was when the skies really opened.This was his first spring here after arriving late last summer following his postgraduation weeks in the Missionary Training Center. And it was beautiful. He didnt think he could ever tire of the fickleness of the regions spring weather the quick vacillations between sun and rain warm and cold. The way everything was starting to bloom into colorful life.Blaine jumped out of bed excited to look out the window and watch puddles form on the pavement below.Is it that time already Elder Hummel mumbled as Blaines feet hit the floor.No you have some time before the alarm goes off. Go back to sleep.Elder Hummel rolled over and pulled the covers tight up to his chin making soft grumbling noises and pursing his lips unconsciously. He seemed to already be asleep again which relieved Blaine. The last thing he wanted was to be a nuisance to his new companion. Plus Elder Hummel was such an endearing sleeper. He looked so at peace. Blaine always had trouble falling asleep the first few nights in a new place but it hadnt been so bad since coming to Ingolstadt. If he got too agitated hed just turn to look at Elder Hummels face in the moonlight. There was something about it that made Blaine feel like he wasnt in a new place at all but had returned to someplace hed always belonged.Blaine went into the kitchen and started getting breakfast together so it would be ready by the time Elder Hummel got upscrambled eggs odds and ends of the vegetables left over in their fridge a few sausages and some soft pretzels theyd picked up from a street vendor the day before. They hadnt worked out a specific cooking schedule yet outside of dinners but Elder Hummel seemed to like his cooking and Blaine was happy to pitch in wherever he could. His older brother Cooper had advised him to always try to think of little ways to make your missionary companion happy and even though Coopers ideas for how to achieve that werent always spot onhed brought a box of headshots on his own mission and autographed two for each of his companions one with a personal message and one suitable for reselling on eBay when Cooper became famousthe advice itself was sound. As the Brethren had said countless times missionary companionships were like a laboratory for learning about marriage. Just like you needed to let go of your selfish concerns and be kind for a successful marriage you needed to do the same things for a successful mission.And so far Blaine thought his new companionship was going pretty well. Elder Hummel wasnt at all like some missionaries who were nearing the end of their time. This was his secondtolast transfer before returning home to the States later this summer but his eye never wandered toward that horizon. He was fully present and everything a senior companion should be dedicated spiritual sensitive to the proddings of the Holy Ghost kind and gently stern when he needed to be. He was patient and loving toward investigators and he seemed to understand them on a level that few missionaries didmaybe the fact of having so many converts in his family had something to do with that.The second day of their mission Blaine had asked about the pictures hung on his companions side of the bedroom. Elder Hummel had started with the photo of himself and what Blaine presumed to be his parents. A middleaged man in a navy blazer and a short woman in a royal blue dress stood with Elder Hummel who was in a red graduation gown andIs that a beetle on your chest Blaine had asked. It was the first time hed come close enough to the picture to make out the shape of the dark spot there. Hed assumed it was a name badge before.Not a real one Elder Hummel had said. A brooch. I have quite the collection back home.Of beetlesOf brooches Elder Hummel said. Well I do have a couple other beetle things too but I wouldnt call it a collection. I like them though. They symbolize persistence and eternal life.Blaine wished he could see Elder Hummel in his everyday clothes. He must have been quite the dresser. I collect bowties.Elder Hummel scrutinized him. Huh. I didnt expect that. But I can see it. It goes with your classical taste in pajamas. I approve.Blaine felt a bit of a rush that he could impress Elder Hummel with his sartorial proclivities. He turned back to the photo. And these are your parentsMy dad and stepmom.Your parents are divorced Blaine had asked.No. My mom died when I was eight Elder Hummel said pointing to the next photo of a woman with a heartshaped face and high cheekbones holding a baby. Thats her. And me.Im sorry Blaine had said.No need to be sorry Elder Hummel said. Unless you mean that dress my mom is wearing. It was a longsleeved midcalf Sunday dress with a wide collar around the neck and large flowers in shades of brown and pink. I cant believe that was the fashion back then. It looks like one of those hideous dresses they make Mormon fundamentalist women wear except for all the gratuitous flowers on it. And my mom was the opposite of a fundamentalist.Elder Hummel steered the conversation back toward his dad and his step mom how he had introduced them to each other and how both he and his dad had loved her just as she was but she had gone off and secretly investigated the church on her own and giving them the joyous shock of their lives when she told them she wanted to convert. Her son never did Elder Hummel explained pointing to a photo of himself and a tall boy in a rugby shirt smiling at the camera.He still could though Blaine said.Well yes. In the spirit world. He died too. Our senior year. Elder Hummel frowned as he said this. It was clearly a fresher injury than his mothers death.That must have been hard Blaine said because his companion would have just brushed off another Im sorry.It was said Elder Hummel. Sometimes it still is. But I like to think my mom is there with him teaching him about the gospel and being his family for him. I know she would love him because we do.Thats beautiful Blaine said.Elder Hummel changed the subject.Maybe that was why Elder Hummel was more reserved than most missionaries and had a seriousness about him that underlay even his laughter. Before Blaine went on his mission his home ward bishop had told him companionships were like marriage so you should never go to bed angry and should give your companion a hug or tell them you loved them preferably both at least once a day. But when Blaine went to give Elder Hummel a goodnight hug their first night together he startled jumping a fraction of an inch as Blaines hands brushed against his shoulders. They both launched into immediate apologiesBlaine had always hugged his companions good night so hed assumed thats what people did but that didnt mean it was okay to assume and Elder Hummel said it was fine really he just hadnt been expecting it right at that moment sometimes he was just a bundle of nerves but yes lets hugand being given a hug after that made it feel all the more special like when a rescued cat thats been eying you with suspicion comes out of nowhere to rub against your ankles.Other than that quickly resolved gaffe their relationship was going smoothly. They both agreed on the importance of keeping the apartment clean following the mission schedule and making real dinners instead of living on buttered pasta and casseroles. They complemented each other in their interests and personalities toothey both loved singing and fashion and Elder Hummel had a delightful sense of humor that was nothing like Blaines full of snark and wise cracks and yet they both found the same things funny and found themselves laughing together multiple times a day.For the first time since hed been on his mission Blaine felt like his abode was turning into a real home.As he cooked Blaine snuck a bite of pretzel with butter. Only a few days in Bavaria and he was already hooked on these things. He was glad Elder Hummel had introduced him to them right off the bat. They were nothing like the soft pretzels from home. First of all they were enormous each equivalent to a loaf of bread. Second of all they were indescribably amazingsalty and fluffy and chewy and dense all at the same time.He resisted the urge to sing to himselfhe didnt want to wake up Elder Hummeland watched the rain fall past the kitchen window as he cooked. He heard the alarm go off in the bedroom the footsteps of Elder Hummel shuffling sleepily from bedroom to bathroom then out into the kitchen.Elder Anderson you didnt have to make breakfast.Blaine didnt look up. The onions had reached a crucial point and he didnt want to risk burning them. I know. But I wanted to. I hope thats okay. A thought occurred to him. Im not stepping on your feet am I Did you want to make your own breakfastI like cooking but I also like other people cooking for me. Especially when it smells that good. Elder Hummel stepped next to Blaine to inspect the emerging scramble. He was smiling and his hair was slightly mussed from sleep. Blaine had the urge to straighten it out with his fingers but his hands were busy with the food and besides Elder Hummel prized his personal space. Ill get out the milk and juice and set the table.Over breakfast they decided to walk to church instead of bike. It was three miles away but Blaine had ripped his rain pants so he would get totally soaked if they biked and hed have to pack an entire change of clothes. If they walked they could keep relatively dry with their umbrellas and overshoes and gaiters. Besides hed get a closer look at Ingolstadt.This is so delightful Blaine said when they were halfway to church. It was refreshingly cold and wet. Elder Hummels breath puffed out in little plumes of steam and the paving stones and sidewalks were saturated with color from the drenching effect of the rain.What is asked Elder Hummel.This Blaine spread his arms in both directions tilting his umbrella toward the street and exposing his head to the rainfall. He didnt usually feel the closeness of the Spirit the way Elder Hummel seemed to but right now he did. All of nature seemed to be singing Gods praises. Its so luxuriant It smells like green things and rainbows.Elder Hummel leaned over to tilt Blaines umbrella back where it belonged covering Blaines head. Hold on Mesa boy. Youre enjoying yourself now but you wont enjoy yourself if you have to walk the next mile and a half with all your clothes soaked through.I suppose. But I just want to dance around the light poles like Gene Kelly in Singin in the Rain.Elder Hummel laughed. Maybe on our way back.It gave Blaine a warm feeling to make Elder Hummel laugh.Then how about My Heavenly Father Loves MeI couldnt say no to that. As long as it doesnt involve dropping our umbrellas and spinning around streetlamps.It doesnt have to even though those activities would arguably make it better.Elder Hummel laughed again and the laughter seemed to live in Blaines chest as much as his companions bubbling up like a spring.Whenever I hear the song of a bird Or look at the blue blue sky Whenever I feel the rain on my face And here Blaine just had to tip his umbrella momentarily to let the fat raindrops splash on his cheeks and nose and then it got even better when Elder Hummel grabbed the handle of his umbrella brushing Blaines hand as he set it aright. Im glad that I live in this beautiful world Heavnly Father created for me. x So are you ready to meet your new branch Elder Hummel asked as they approached the commercial building where the Ingolstadt congregation met. A beer market on the ground level took up most of the facade.I hope so. Blaine unconsciously reached up to smooth his hand over his hair but the action became conscious as soon as he touched it. It was frizzy. Oh yeah. That was the downside to rain. I might have to touch up in the bathroom so I look respectable.Your hair looks nice like that Elder Hummel said then looked away. But I suppose its a little too poofy to fit in with the hair guidelines. Well go into the bathroom and fix it up first thing.You really think it looks nice My brother Cooper always says I look like a head of broccoli when my hairs not gelled down.I think brothers just say things like that whether theyre true or not. Besides I like broccoli.They had to walk around the back of the beer market to get to the staircase that would lead them up to the office space on the second floor where the branch met. Blaine was struck by the irony and said so.I know. Kurt said. I can never decide if its a good thing or a bad thing that theyre closed when we meet on Sundays. Im sure the absence of liquor sales is conducive to the Spirit but on the other hand maybe if it was open the presence of the Holy Ghost brought about by sacrament meeting would be felt in the store and turn a few people away from alcohol. Who knows maybe theyd even end up walking up these stairs and joining us. The Ingolstadt branch could certainly use a few more members.They were the first to arrive save the branch president who had already unlocked the building and the sister missionaries. Other elders might have felt chastened that the sister missionaries arrived at church before they did but not Blaine. He didnt understand why so many of the male missionaries got competitive with the sisters. The sisters were already at a disadvantagethey only got to serve 18 months instead of two years they didnt get to baptize their own investigators and they were never given leadership roles like zone leader or assistant to the president. All that and they worked just as hard or maybe even harder than the elders. They should be allowed to get their victories where they could.Elder Anderson this is Schwester Rose and Schwester Wilde Elder Hummel introduced them.Schwester Rose was tall with a friendly smile long brown hair that fell loosely around her shoulders and a flowered skirt that coordinated with her last name. She shook Blaines hand. Freut mich she said. Nice to meet you.Youre almost as short as me was Schwester Wildes greeting in German. She had what Blaine thought might be a Dusseldorf accent. She also had a very firm grip.Relative to our companions at least Blaine returned. Hed long ago learned not to take any straightforward comment from a German personally otherwise hed spend every night crying himself to sleep. Still Blaine did find Schwester Wildes entire presentation a bit intimidating. Her lips were puckered like shed just eaten a lemon her blonde hair was pulled back in a bun so tight it threatened to pull her hair out from the roots and she stood as straight as a Navy general. But that was okay. He rather liked intimidating women.Elder Hummel I have the best newsand you too of course Elder Anderson. Schwester Rose floated a hand over toward Blaine as if to reassure him but pulled away without making contact. You know that Japanese family whove been investigating the church with us Chiko and Takuya with the adorable little girl They want to set a date for baptismElder Hummels face lit up. He squeezed Blaines arm in delight. He used five different German words that all translated to wonderful to describe the news. He bounced on his toes without leaving the floor. Elder Anderson and I can sit down with them to schedule it once theyre here and then burst out with more superlatives.Elder Hummels joy was possibly as delightful as the news itself. Blaine had been in Germany for how long and never done a baptism. And now hed shown up in Ingolstadt for a few days and one was falling right in his lap. First Elder Hummel then the rain and now a baptism What had he done to earn Gods favor like thisThe elation must have been obvious in Blaines face and too easy for a sister to misinterpret. Dont go thinking that youll get to add this to your stats Elder Anderson said Schwester Wilde screwing up her eyes at him. Were the ones whove been teaching the Higashis. Those baptisms are ours even if youre the ones performing them.I never would. Its just The idea that I could be a part of something so important in even just a small way. To serve you and your investigators and the church. Its exciting.Schwester Wilde looked momentarily baffled. Then her expression softened. You really mean that dont you But it was a statement more than a question.Talking to the sisters delayed the fixing of Elder Andersons rainfrizzed hair but they managed to deal with it before anyone else showed up.Do I look okay Elder Anderson asked once his hair was tamed back into Rock Hudsonstyle sophistication. I still feel like its poofing out.It looks fine. It looked better than fine but Kurt wasnt about to say that. Curly hair isnt actually against the grooming standards you know.I know. But long hair is. And you can tell its getting long when its not gelled down. Im probably overdue for a haircut.We can go get haircuts tomorrow Kurt said. I know a barber who gives discounts to missionaries.A member Elder Anderson tucked the hair gel and comb into his emergency grooming kit and dropped it in his backpack.No. Just a nice guy.Elder Thompson used to cut my hair in Leipzig. Since he had curly hair too he sort of knew what to do with it.Kurt felt a pointless tinge of jealousy. He wished he knew what to do with curly hair. He tried not to imagine what it would be like to cut Elder Andersons hair one hand holding the trimmer while the other fluffed the strands back into place. He tried not to imagine brushing his fingertips over the back of Elder Andersons neck to clean away the strays.He failed.You okay elder You look a little feverish.Kurt caught his own reflection as he moved to meet Elder Andersons gaze in the mirror. His cheeks were as pink as a bowl of raspberries. He cleared his throat and rubbed the back of the ring he constantly wore on his mission. It was emblazoned with the letters CTR ever reminding him to choose the right. Im fine. I just flush easily. It could be the temperature shift after coming in from the rain. That wasnt a lie. It could be. It could also be something else.Kurt flushed again when they left the bathroom and the branch president came over to talk to them. Elder Anderson its wonderful to have you in our branch. President Schmidt reached out to give Elder Andersons hand a firm shake. You are blessed to be working with Elder Hummel. He is truly a remarkable missionary. You will learn a lot from him.I agree Elder Anderson replied. Just knowing him these few days Im amazed by his faith. Hes already taught me a lot about walking in Christs footsteps.Ugh. What was it with Mormons that they couldnt stop at simply being nice They just had to go out of the way to say ridiculously complimentary things about each other didnt they And it was so much worse with the German Mormons because Germans dont shower people with superlatives unless they really mean it. He was getting the feeling that Elder Anderson was like that too. Sincere to a fault.Except it didnt feel like a fault right now. It felt terribly embarrassing but also delightful and warm. Very warm. Kurts cheeks were on fire. Elder Anderson is very kind but Im learning just as much from him as he is learning from me. He is so much more patient than I am and he has such a generous heart. Kurt could beat them at their own game of embarrassing truthtelling kindness.Now it was Elder Andersons turn to blush. The color change wasnt as obvious on his face just a little brush of peach dust on his cheekbones but it was there.Payback was delicious.Im just happy to serve said Elder Anderson. Please Herr Pr√§sident Schmidt let me know if theres anything I can do to help in the branch.Elder Hummel knows all of what needs to be done. Has he told you hes our music director Hes putting together an Easter choir.Noo. Elder Anderson inflected it more like an excited question than a statement as he turned toward Kurt with big eyes. But I shouldnt be surprised. Ive heard him sing.Yes hes very good isnt he Well Im sure if he needs help in that area and you have the talent he could use you there. We always have a shortage of male singers. And of course there are the English lessons youll be responsible for. The sisters run the quitsmoking group but theyll let you know if they need your help. On top of all the investigators Elder Hummel manages to find I think that will keep you busy enough.Their conversation was interrupted by the delighted squeal of a small child as it burst through the branch door. New missionary Kurt turned to see the son of the First Counselor staring up in admiration at Elder Anderson. Me too kid Kurt thought and immediately regretted it.The next ten or fifteen minutes were spent introducing Elder Anderson to every person who walked through the front door.I am never going to remember all these names Elder Anderson whispered to Kurt when the trickle slowed.Is that true Or a figure of speech You seem like the type of person who has a whole system for remembering the name of every person you meet.Elder Anderson smiled sheepishly. How did you know thatJust a hunch.Fine. You got me. But that doesnt mean its easy.Its okay Kurt said. We have a directory back in the apartment. You can review it this week as much as you want. Ill help.Thats very thoughtful of you. Thank you.You mean that sincerely dont youHow else would I mean itKurt squeezed Elder Andersons upper arm. He was too much. I dont know why you needed this whole mortal probation thing. Youre already so good.Elder Anderson ducked his head and batted his eyes in bashful delight. Stop it. You hardly know me. Youll find out all my faults eventually.I suppose. Somehow Kurt doubted they would bother him that much though.Anyway since youre the music director and I cant believe you didnt tell meI should let you know I can play piano. I took lessons for years. I played a lot in church and Sunday school back home too. So if you ever want me to...That would be great. We only have a handful of piano players in the branch and Im one of them. Im doing the prelude today but maybe you can do it next week We could stay after Elders Quorum and Sunday school today for a few minutes so you can practice.Elder Anderson broke into a smile as wide as his face. Id love that.None of their investigators showed up for sacrament meeting but that didnt come as a surprise. Kurt hadnt been able to get any of them to commit to coming to churchwell Samir and Nuriyah might have committed if hed asked just to see what it was like but it hadnt seemed right to press them into it when they couldnt become members anyway.Schwester Rose and Schwester Wilde on the other hand had their hands full of investigators. There was a young single woman theyd started teaching a few weeks earlier an older widow who drifted in and out of lessons and the Higashisthe family preparing for baptism.The sisters took pity on the investigatorless elders and asked them to sit with the Higashis. Kurt joined them and Elder Anderson after playing the prelude on the branchs electronic piano a wordless rendition of A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief. Tamiko the couples 3yearold daughter was worming through the chair legs from the row in front of them. She stuck her chubby face out from her fortress and squeezed Kurts shoe as he sat down next to the wife.Tamiko Chiko muttered followed by some mild Japanese scolding that resulted in the little girl squirming out with a halfhearted sulk and crawling onto her mothers lap.Its really fine Kurt said. Ive never met a child under the age of seven who can sit still through an entire sacrament meeting. Besides shes very cute.I am glad you think so Chiko responded then sighed as Tamiko wriggled out of her lap to play with Kurts shoelaces all through the opening prayer. Kurt added a silent note of gratitude for small hands and curious minds but when he opened his eyes he could see Chiko was getting near the end of her rope. Takuya on the other side of her was ignoring the entire situation while Elder Anderson three chairs down was trying to be reverent but kept sneaking amused glances over at them.Let me go find her something to draw with Kurt offered. My dad says thats the only thing that kept me still in sacrament meetings when I was little. I did not make my mothers Sundays easy.But the coloring book and crayons Kurt rummaged from the primary closet were unneeded by the time he got back. Tamiko had made her way down the row and was sitting next to Elder Anderson pretending to read the church bulletin to him in a cooing mixture of Japanese and German. He paid rapt attention nodding in fervent agreement whenever she whispered a word with particular conviction.The two of them were ridiculously adorable. With new investigators Kurt and Elder Anderson would have spent much of the hour explaining the service in low whispers but the Higashis had been there almost a dozen times alreadysince before even Kurt had arrived in Ingolstadtand didnt really need any guidance. They knew when to sing how to cross their arms in prayer and not to take the sacrament. Takuya belted out the hymns and Tamiko just plain belted out but Chiko struggled. Its hard to read music and German at the same time she whispered to Kurt upon flubbing a note.Dont worry he said. Sooner or later youll know all the hymns by ear.It felt funny sometimes how he was expected to give guidance to individuals who had been in a branch or ward longer than he had. But he was constantly giving people guidance who were well over twice his age so perhaps this wasnt too different. And Chiko and Takuya seemed to be glad to have the elders there if for no other reason than Elder Anderson was an amazing babysitter. Tamiko had finally shown interest in the crayons and was coloring haphazard squiggles over a picture of Jesus blessing the Nephite children. She refused to leave Elder Andersons side and tried to crawl into his lap several timesa thing that Elder Anderson kept fending off because it was against the rules for missionaries to hold or hug children. Of course she only viewed that as a challenge and became more insistent.She can sit with you Chiko said. Its fine.Oh but we have a ruleTamiko grinned triumphantly and catapulted herself into Elder Andersons lap before he could finish his explanation.By the time the service was over Tamiko had fallen asleep. Her mouth dropped open and drool pooled at the corner of her mouth staining Elder Andersons shirt.Its a shame we cant use you as our babysitter Chiko said as Elder Anderson handed the little girl into her arms. Consider becoming an au pair after your mission. Well definitely hire you.A job offer already Kurt teased a few minutes later as they rearranged the chapel chairs for Elders Quorum.Am I in trouble Elder Anderson asked his nose squinched in something like embarrassment. I really tried to keep her off my lap.I know. Once Chiko said it was okay there wasnt much you can do. I dont think it would have been helpful to explain that missionaries arent allowed to touch kids. To the untrained ear that makes it sound like were all child molesters on probation.Elder Anderson grimaced. But the rule is there toprotect us from misunderstandings. I know. But saying that to an investigator is just as weird. Its like saying We expect you to baselessly accuse us of inappropriately touching your children. Either way it inserts a level of miss trust in the relationship. And Chiko and Takuya are so close to baptism. We dont want to throw a wrench in things now. We want them to feel comfortable with us. Kurt paused. So its great that they feel so comfortable with you already. I dont think youll have any trouble finding your place in this branch.I hope not Elder Anderson said. I do think Ill love the people here. But that doesnt always mean I mean sometimes you can be surrounded by people who you respect and admire and love and still feel out of place.To Kurt Elder Anderson seemed like the type of person who would fit in anywhere he went just on the power of his charm. Of course here in Germany there was the whole language barrier and the slight shifts in culture as you moved from district to district. HomesickNo. Its always been like that.Im sorry.Its like that for everyone sometimes though isnt it It sounded like both an assumption and a genuine question.I wouldnt know. Im not as good a person as you are Elder Anderson. Ive never been surrounded by people who I respect and admire and love because I always find something to judge about someone.I dont believe you. Youre so compassionate with investigators even when they say frustrating things. And youve been perfectly gracious with everyone weve interacted with in the branch today.Ive learned to be more patient on my mission. And I tend to be less judgmental with Germans in general. I guess because its a different culture. But you should have seen me in high school. Or even at the beginning of my mission. I could be a real jerk.I dont believe you.I can provide references.Elder Anderson laughed. Fine. But you dont seem that way to me. Is there anyone in this branch youve been judgingKurt mulled it over. He went through everyone he could think of and was surprised to find that he didnt dislike a single one. No. I suppose not.So maybe youve changed.Maybe. Kurt wasnt convinced. He might be patient with members and investigators but his peers were another thing. He could barely endure his regular phone calls with their senior zone leader a selfrighteous nincompoop from Provo who couldnt tell the difference between Utah culture and the teachings of the church. And as recent as a few days earlier Kurt had been short with Elder Flanaganand it certainly hadnt been the first time. But Kurt kept his thoughts to himself. It wasnt appropriate to bring up his beefs with leaders or previous junior companions to his new one.Kurts stomach was growling by the time the threehour block wound to a close. He wasnt the only one who was hungryhe was pretty sure hed also heard Elder Andersons stomach rumbling next to him in the back row and over the last half hour he had seen more than one parent reach into their kids diaper bag and sneak handfuls of Cheerios and carrot sticks to tide them over.Kurt had more class than that. He waited until the block was actually over to rifle through his backpack pockets for the pretzel half hed stored there before leaving for church. He held it up for Elder Anderson to inspect. You want someYes. Im starving and I didnt think to bring anything.Walking three miles in the rain will do that to you.Ha. True. Elder Anderson tore off a bitesized piece and popped it into his mouth.So Ive been thinking about what we need to do before we head home.Elder Anderson waited to swallow before responding. When did you have time to do that Since I know you were onehundred percent focused on the lesson.Kurt felt something flitter in his chest. Was that a joke Elder AndersonElder Anderson smirked. Kurt hadnt known he was capable of that expression. Maybe he wasnt such an innocent lamb after all. Youll have to tell me. Was it funnyI confess to being amused. Kurt tore off a chunk of pretzel with his teeth. He may have been too classy to snack during a meeting but he wasnt too classy to eat like a barbarian. Why dont you practice on the piano while I meet with the Higashis to schedule a baptism dateIs that okay If Im not thereYeah. It should just be straightforward checking our calendars for dateswell as straightforward as it can get between our schedule and the sister missionaries and the branch presidents and the Higashis. It wont involve counseling or anything like that. The sisters are responsible for preparing them for their baptismal interviews.Elder Anderson chewed thoughtfully. His brows were furrowed. He hummed as if preparing a thought then tilted his head this way and that as if that might communicate his response. It was clear he had something to say but was too polite to say it with food in his mouth.Kurt responded to what he thought the gestures might mean. Unless you want to be in on the scheduling I dont want you to feel left out. I was just thinking it would give you a few more minutes on the piano before they have to lock up. And since we have the exact same scheduleElder Anderson finally swallowed. No its fine. I just dont want you to think Im the type of missionary to shirk my duties.It clearly wasnt a joke. Theres really no danger of that Elder Anderson. I think Ive sized you up pretty well already.Oh And whats my sizeKurt thought about making some joke about Elder Anderson being short because it was kind of adorable how compact he was. But Elder Anderson might be sensitive about that. So Kurt gave a direct answer. Youre the real deal. Youre in this with your whole heart.Elder Anderson ducked his head but kept his eyes on Kurts through lowered lashes. They were thick dark lashes Kurt noticednot for the first time. Cmon Elder Anderson said nudging Kurt with his elbow. You dont want to keep the Higashis waiting.The scheduling didnt take long at all. Elder Anderson had only been playing for a few minutes by the time everyone agreed on a date and put their calendars away. Hed turned the keyboard volume low to avoid disturbing them so all Kurt could make out from the foyer was an occasional blurry cluster of notes that never amounted to a tune. Tamikos young ears seemed to hear more clearly. She listened attentively her ear tilted toward the sound humming phrases to herself and staring longingly through the doorway to the chapel toward the source of music.As everyone started to stand up she whispered something to her mother.Tamiko wants to know if she can go watch your companion play the piano Chiko said to Kurt.I dont see why not. Hell be playing in front of the whole branch next Sunday.Chiko released Tamiko from her arms and the little girl darted on her fat little legs through the chapel door and straight toward the music. She stopped suddenly at the end of the piano grabbing onto its leg and staring up at Elder Anderson with studious eyes. It took a few moments before he noticed she was there. Hello little one he said in German without pausing his playing. Should I turn it up so you can hear betterTamiko nodded sincerely as Kurt settled in the front row with her parents for the impromptu concert.Within five notes at normal volume Kurt recognized the song as If You Should Hie to Kolob a hymn about esoteric Mormon cosmology that couldnt be mistaken as springing from any other flavor of Christianity when accompanied by lyrics. It was one of Kurts least favorite hymnsor at least the one he was most ambivalent aboutbecause the lyrics were as strange and embarrassing as the tune was lovely.But Kurt didnt need to worry about the lyrics now. He could just listen and enjoy. And there was so much to enjoy. Elder Andersons version was more intricate than the hymnal arrangement more lyrical. It made Kurt feel the way the world must feel when it blossomed into spring. The melody filled Kurt with a sense of divine longing one that grew with each note. It wasnt a new longing but one that was always there only subsumed like an old wound that had never fully healed too painful to dwell upon. And simultaneously the baseline answered that longing with a spreading sense of peace.Kurt alternated between closing his eyes to let the music wash over him and opening them to watch the way it washed over and through Elder Anderson. He seemed connected to the music somehow like it was an extension of his body like each note was as much a part of him as his own fingertips. At his side Tamiko rocked to and fro bobbing on the wave of the melody.The final note was not played on the keyboard. It came after that. It was the quiet that filled the room as Elder Anderson lifted his hands from the piano creating a silent note that was buoyant and pregnant with joy.Tamiko was the first to clap. She squealed too with a gush of words that Kurt didnt understand. He still got the meaning behind them though. He shared the sentiment.Someone has a new admirer Kurt said as they stepped out of the building to walk back home. The rain had stopped sometime during Sunday school and a rainbow had broken out over Ingolstadt.Tamiko Yes. I am her number one admirer Elder Anderson said with a bright smile.I was referring to her admiration of you but I suppose its mutual.I hope so. I love kids. They have such a refreshing way of looking at things. Though Im not sure I love them enough to be an au pairor maybe I do. I dont know. I still have a lot to learn about myself.Ill say Kurt said with mock haughtiness. Apparently you dont know that youre a brilliant piano player for example. I dont know why you were so worried about practicing when you played If You Could Hie to Kolob so perfectly.You didnt hear the part right at the beginning when you all were waiting for President Schmidt and I was practicing with no sound on.Kurt considered this. True but then neither did you.Elder Anderson laughed. I know where my fingers landed and it wasnt always the right place.All I know is that its a lot better than my playing. I pretty much only play straight out of the hymnal and even then I skip a lot of the notes.I dont remember you skipping any notes this morning with the prelude. Just changing some to make it sound better.Its a nice side effect if thats the case. But my only intention was to make it easier for me to play. I still have it in my mind that there are notes that I cant reach even though my hands have grown since I took piano lessons. I guess old habits die hard.When did you stop taking lessonsSometime in middle school My aunt had been my piano teacher but I think she was drunk half the time during our lessons.Elder Anderson did a double take. Oh Shes not a memberJack Mormon. Anyway she always said it was tea which I thought was scandalous enough but she did end up going to rehab for alcohol and after that she decided to start over in a new place to live that wasnt in walking distance and a new career so my piano education is incomplete shall we say.Is she okay nowMore or less. She took up smoking at her AA meetings but you cant win them all. No she said in one of her recent letters that shes trying to quit those too and becoming just as addicted to Nicorette. Kurt scanned Elder Andersons face for his reaction. He looked surprised but that was all. Kurt couldnt find any judgment in there.But shes happy Because of course thats what Elder Anderson cared about. Not how well Kurts aunt stuck to the rules but whether the rules she followed brought her happiness.I think so. Though I didnt even know she was unhappy before she went to rehab so Im probably not the best judge.The world is hard to figure out when youre a kid.Kurt huffed. Its hard to figure out now.Really Elder Anderson looked at Kurt curiously. For you You seem like youre doing a pretty good job of it.Thats because you dont live inside my head.But I mean youre so confident. So certain of yourself you knowKurt was certain of God the church and the love his heavenly and earthly parents had for him. He was certain of the talents that hed been gifted with singing creating things with his hands making a comfortable home. But was he certain of himself How could he when the different parts of who he was didnt fit within the certain truth of the Plan of Happiness Why he was on this earth who he was meant to becomeit was still a mystery to. Kurt. Im certain about some things Kurt said. Other things I have no idea about.Elder Anderson looked up at the sky as if seeking answers from the silvery cumulus clouds floating past. It was interesting hanging out with Tamiko today. Like I was thinking back when I was her size the world was at least five times bigger than it is now relatively speaking. Which is kind of awesome to think about but also a little terrifying. Like everything must be exciting and overwhelming at the same time.Isnt it still though Kurt said. Because thats how he felt right now how hed felt for the past few days ever since shaking hands with Elder Anderson at the train station.Well yes Elder Anderson said. But I think it must be more intense as a baby. Theres so much more you dont know.A line from If You Should Hie to Kolob came into Kurts headone of the lines that didnt bother him There is no end to matter there is no end to space. Except that we still dont know much. Relative to the universe you and me and Tamiko are all the same size and the same age. Its like the hymn says. Creation is infinite.Elder Anderson nodded. When Tamiko fell asleep and started drooling on me it felt like such a huge act of trust. Whether she knew it or not she was trusting me to hold her and protect her and care for her. And it made me think about Heavenly Father. How hes so dependable so much there for me that Im not even conscious of it all the time. And he doesnt resent or get mad that I forget. He just loves me. He sees how small and vulnerable we are in our bodies of flesh and he loves us for it.Warmth spread through Kurts chest. I think youre going to be an incredible dad one day. I hope so. Or at least a good one Elder Anderson said. How many kids do you want to haveIt was natural for Elder Anderson to ask the question that way. He didnt need to ask do you want to have children because for any good church member the answer must be yes. Spirits were waiting in heaven for bodies so that they could come to earth and follow the Plan of Salvation. It was each members duty to create such bodies within the confines of marriage. But Kurt had never gotten that far in his imaginings of the future. For all intents and purposes he avoided thinking about his future familyor whether he could even have oneas much as possible. With the way things were for him it helped him stay saner to take life one step at a time. I dont know he said.I dont know exactly how many either but I definitely want them. And more than one. Probably closer in age than me and my brother. I love him but each of us were basically only children for half of our childhoods. Elder Anderson looked at Kurt apologetically. Not that theres anything wrong with being an only child of course. But it got lonely.No youre right. It did get lonely. I think if I were to have kids Id want more than one too.What do you mean if How would you not have kidsKurt shrugged. Hed have to tell Elder Anderson eventually but it didnt feel like the right moment yet. Sometimes God has other plans.No youre right. My brother and his wife dont have kids yet. And my seminary teacher was in his fifties and had never been married. I dont know why. The sisters in the ward really seemed to love him.Kurt had mused occasionally about working for the church to make up for his inability to live up to the Plan of Happiness. He wondered if Elder Andersons seminary teacher had the same issue.You know Elder Anderson said when I think about my future I honestly think more about the kids I want to have and not so much about the wife. Its easier somehow to picture reading to them and playing with them and taking them to ball games and pageants and church and stuff. Maybe because I used to babysit in high school and I have a bunch of younger cousins so I can imagine based on experience. Having a wife theres nothing really to base that on.Huh. Even Kurt had imagined what his future wife might be like though that mostly involved trial runs in his head of being married to Mercedes and trying to figure out if a passionless best friendship was enough to build a marriage on.But kids Theyd be such a blessing. Like right now Elder Anderson pointed to the rainbow that arced through the sky. Sunlight bounced off the polished steel of his CTR ring catching on the grooves of the W√§hle das Recht engraved on the band. Can you imagine what it would be like to show a child that for the first time in their life To see the look on their faceYes Kurt could. It would look something like Elder Andersons face looked right now joyous and full of awe.And youd see it through their eyes like you were seeing it for the first time. Because Id know its just light passing through water droplets but then Id think about light and I think about water droplets and those are miracles too. And the whole complex chemistry that makes up the atmosphere this perfect conflux of conditions that produces something so amazingly beautiful.Kurt slowed his steps to really look at the rainbow following its bow from the trees on the horizon to a point high in the sky where it faded slowly into a cluster of steely blue clouds. It really was a sight to behold.But Kurt didnt need a child to see things anew. Elder Anderson was doing a pretty good job of making the world a fresh fascinating thing all on his own.,Mature,Slow BurnPiningMutual PiningReligionMormonismMissionariesLGBTQ ThemesLGBTQ CharacterCanon LGBTQ CharacterComing of AgeGermanyInternalized HomophobiaPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder - PTSDscrupulosityGrief/MourningFish out of WaterCanonical Character Deathhappens off-screen before story beginsHappy EndingFluff and AngstComing OutClueless Blaine AndersonHomophobiaAlternate Universe - Canon DivergenceCrisis of FaithChristianityIn 2014 the word Mormon was not a win for SatanNo cheatingBiblical Scripture References (Abrahamic Religions)david/jonathan (the biblical gay ship)

Broken home divorced parents alcoholic dad the list went on. Her mother left her and her younger sister Mary with their father after the divorce papers were filed moving off the reservation to some place in Halifax never coming back.That had been a year ago and things hadnt improved since.Isabella couldnt remember the last time she had been happy or even the last time she had smiled but at least she talked Mary didnt she stopped talking the day their mom left.She ran her finger through her hair twirling it around in circlesI gotta get out of hereShe thought Take Mary and just go Dad wont notice bet he would even be happy wed be gone.She cringed it hurt to even think such a thing but it wasnt far from the truth.Glancing at the clock on her dresser Isabella sighed it was twelveSchool tomorrow.Switching off the light she rolled over and fell into a fitful sleep.John Tyler walked along the sidewalk his silver staff tapping the ground in a rhythm he had become well accustomed too.It had been three years since Middlebrook and Jessica Cosdale the event that sealed his fate as one of Gods Knights though every night he still dreamed of the girls face keeping him awake with nightmares.Michael tried reassuring him that there was nothing he could have done but he refused to believe it knowing the Archangel was only trying to make him forgive himself.Birds sang over head as he walked cars passed on the pavement their drivers oblivious to anything other than their intended destination ignoring all road safety and speed laws to get there.The people who passed him stared but how could they not His appearance made him look like a beggar ripped jeans black V neck shirt badly wrinkled and long dark beard unkempt for quite sometime. The only thing presentable on John was his hair a short buzz cut.But he didnt take notice to the stares he was focused on his mission preventing a Demon from carrying out a mass shooting at Joseph Howe High school.Michael had sent him the details while he slept the usual way the Angel kept in touch now even if it was only once and awhile. He hadnt heard from him in three weeks but he had no time to worry about it.The Demon called Agiel already killed the security guard at the school as a warm up for its big show transforming itself into her likeness to make it easier to enter the building.Joseph Howe High school looked exactly like what one would think a suburban school looked like. It was a long building it was two stories tall holding approximately nineteen classrooms in all.John watched from across the street as buses began dropping kids off drinking a cup of Tim Hortons coffee to keep his energy up.For an hour and a half he kept his eyes on the main entrance waiting for any signs of Agiel.Besides the janitor however he saw nothing and decided to try something else.Throwing his coffee into a nearby trash can John marched across the street into the schoolyard intending to go inside and wait.Nearing the entrance out of the corner of his eye he caught sight of an overweight woman in a uniform getting out of a rusted Chevrolet Spark at the back of the parking lot.Thinking fast he ran behind a red pickup truck taking care not to make too much noise.Peeking over the side of the tailgate he studied her. She wore a greyish brown uniform a pistol attached to the belt but it was her eyes that gave her away.The womans eyes were pure red devoid of pupils or sclera he had found Agiel.Summoning the power of the staff John revealed himself stepping in the Demons way.You guys never find victims who can actually fight back do youSwinging the staff upwards he slammed a beam of magic into the Demon sending her rolling backwards.Growling Agiel sprang back up rushing at the Knight only to be blown backwards again by another blast from the staff.You would think Lucifer would send a more able soldierJohn tauntedOne who could actually fight.Agiel barely able to stand barked something he assumed was an insult but was not understandable.Yes yes. I know Im a son of a bitch. But hey look at it this way now you wont have to face the Devils wrath for failing.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/49514500,Genesis,IN THE BEGINNING HaShem created the skies and the land. Now the world was dark and without form and the Spirit of HaShem had moved along the formless expense. And the Spirit of HaShem breathed and like a spark of fire ignited the world expanded from Them in every direction from the north to the south to the east and to the west. And HaShem then went and made a jar and held the primeval light about Them and put the light into a little container and spake of the waters andd the winds of the heavenly realmand took them together gathering the two with each other to make the twain one and mixing the light with the two to make a mixture unknown before to man of all the three before imbuing it with a portion of Their essence creating life. And then after this had been done HaShem spoke saying Let it that shall be be let that that has been be let that that is be and from Their speech the world was made in five stages. And first water flowed from HaShem like wine upon the altar or like the rivers of the land from HaShem to all the directions of the world to the left and the right to the north and to the south. And then a small flame erupted from HaShem and moved about continuously before growing larger and larger. Then this flame moved from Them to engulf further from it creating the stars and the rocky land and the heavenly bodies such as the sun and the moon and the planets of the sky as well as the movements of them. Thirdly then from HaShem moved a gentle wind and it encircled about Them before dispersing itself to all the directions of the world as an essence of Them. And HaShem went and from the fire and the wind and the water made the malakhim and placed them as messengers under Them to communicate Their will to all the world. And then from this again HaSHem spoke saying Let there thus be time to record the seasons of the earth and the beginning of the world for then shalt it be to see the world and all therein and lo and behold it was so. From then the Day began Day and the Night Night and from then the week and the month and the years came from this. And HaShem then opened the jar that They had sealed and life flowed from it all across the world and the mixture of life thus moved across the skies and the land fashioning itself into the plants of the earth and the animals of the water and of the land and of the sky and then after them all humanity. Then HaShem spoke to the humans that had been made by Them saying Lo and behold I have selected you among all the creatures of the earth to be partakers of my divine nature. Be fruitful and multiply and move all across the face of the earth. For upon all of Creation I have given a portion of my spirit LIfe but to you all I give you a double portion.Be stewards of the world I have made and nurture it and it shall go well with you all. However if you are selfish and do evil unto your fellow man and all the living creature of the Creation things will not go well due to your evil. And it shall be done. Go now and when you have settled rest. And all the people hearing this went through the earth to the left and to the right to the north and to the south and after seven days all settled in the lands that HaShem had made. And HaSHem called unto the malakhim and commanded them to go with the humans and teach them how to use the world and to praise HaShem in all Their glory. And on making materials from the ground into weapons for hunting and into tents for living in and to tools for farming each according to the preference of the group. And when this was done they returned to HaShem. And on the seventh day from their departure all the creatures of the skies and the land and the malakhim to even HaShem Themself rested on that day and enjoyed the Creation that They had finished making.,Teen And Up Audiences,Creation MythOther Additional Tags to Be Addedno beta we die like jesusAlternate Universe - Canon DivergenceFlood Mythbut not really

https://archiveofourown.org/works/48283102,Tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis,Take the children desperately he pushed Selina aside. In the place where the woman was a large crater appeared from which a smoldering flame crackled. Ludger didnt pay attention to what was going on behind him studying the picture in front of him. To feel the tension growing with every minute... This was the main rule if you wanted to win in a deliberately uneven fight.He saw something illusory flash past the fallen green thickets. The power of a single attack turned out to be much greater than that of an ordinary wizard. Also the irrational actions committed by the mysterious assailant seem to be trying to lure people into a trap.Therefore Ludger thought it best to force the students and Selina to go further to the rear. It was much easier to hold on alone than with the burden of a dozen lives behind. It was something he could handle on his own right The attack caught them all by surprise almost signing a death sentence. White light froze on the horizon kicking up dust and oh my it looked like a radiation mushroom skin began to boil and melt under the sun. The hot wind raised waves of burnt leaves that flew straight into the face. Ludger should have known this was not going to be a pleasant experience but he couldnt stop the urge to gouge his eyes out from the searing pain. He grasped the cane swaying with trembling The horizon became a solid white line. Someones screams echoed through the loud explosion fading away with a long ringing in the ears. Ludger could feel sweat tears and blood mixing on his cheeks and chin. The bones seemed to crack under the atmospheric pressure causing the wounded body to fall downwards. The earth joyfully greeted with a firm embrace. There was silence around completely uncharacteristic for this. He knew there would be groans pleas and gasps from people stuck half a step from death. A group of bodies stacked one on top of another by a powerful force Ludger was trying his best not to focus on the losses okay Debris scattered with a radioactive glow pierced the scorched glade in great spears in an empty space where nothing remained but black ash. Nature was completely destroyed turning into a dead cell with craters and potholes. The air suddenly became heavy. One careless breath was accompanied by a lingering cough. The rest of the dust stuck unpleasantly in his throat Ludger mentally restrained himself from damaging his larynx. The feeling of something cold on his forehead made the man shiver further disturbing the broken bones.Nevertheless the rapidly increasing agony left his tired body and the next thing he saw was complete darkness. Selina knew that Ludger could be trusted. He was a soldier first and foremost and only then her colleague and the object of... well adoration It was embarrassing to admit but a womans heart could not act otherwise.She believed that a man like Ludger Shelsey would be able to pull off his part of the plan by executing some kind of superior strategy to win. This man had previously served in the army and probably had enough experience and materials for an unequal battle.So I repeat myself. Selina was sure that everything would end well even despite the destruction of the forest massif and several other not so big troubles. Until one moment. A loud rumble similar to thunder sounded somewhere nearby and for a moment seeing the children along the detour paths she saw discs of light appear in the sky covering the territory of the forest.The phenomenon was mesmerizing but anxiety was stronger than aesthetic views. Besides Selina didnt have to study him for more than a few seconds.A strange glow suddenly exploded sending up columns of smoke. Belatedly it became clear that this was not what her colleague expected from the attack. And exactly directed there Selina swallowed the panic that was brewing deep inside and with all possible seriousness ordered the students to run and hide. Probably she was not the best teacher leaving the children to get to the dormitory on their own although the total distance was reduced to five or six meters.This decision was not professional in nature on the contrary it contradicted common sense. But now... she must come to the aid of a loved one. Stay away Selina instructed the frightened children proceed carefully along the river. If you see something suspicious run without turning around. The students nodded excitedly. There were no injuries among them but some were accidentally hit by debris leaving cuts elsewhere. For most of the time they tried to fight off the enemy together but in the end they still suffered a crushing defeat.But children remained children. Just as the teachers are not ready to be rejected so the students instinctively wanted to stay alive. Selinas heart broke as she looked into their innocent eyes filled with primal terror. Quickly do not stand. Go at last a gentle voice broke revealing tension. A group of students anxiously consulted among themselves and retreated into the darkness of the thicket. So she had no choice but to quickly return the way she came.Passing broken trees and craters traces of a fierce struggle could be seen. The closer the final target became the more damage the attack did. Selina still remembered that dazzling white light that suddenly shone in the sky like a second sun. A scary sight. The woman shook her head pushing away the disturbing thoughts this was the last thing she should have with her.Finally a burnt area appeared in front of my eyes stained with blood and covered with ashes. In fact a complete fire. She had never seen destruction worse than this.The wind carried away the shredding of the leaves twisting them into a small vortex Selina inhaled loudly the polluted air provoking a dry cough. And oh my everything here was just terribleDevastated and burned broken and destroyed to the ground... She remembered how the forest was raging just a minute ago. Only a single attack wiped him off the face of the earth for the next hundreds of years.Nevertheless the woman moved on. Her gaze was cast downwards carefully examining the dryness or mass beneath her feet. With measured but quick steps she headed forward eager to find at least some clues. The belief that it was possible... someone was still alive. There were no bodies around. Selina covered the hideous sight behind blonde eyelashes and tousled hair Her foot pushed against someones hard flesh the bone cracked under the determined pressure of the boots. A groan of agony forced pessimistic ideas to disappear.The sound was quiet and unfamiliar but there was something about it that made Selina shiver wildly. A wounded man in front of her. The familiar features of a sculpted face stained with a mixture of dust and blood and long gentianblue hair with firescorched ends. Ludger Shelsey lay flat on the cold ground gasping for air heavy from the explosion.Selinas slender arms reached out to support his battleweakened body casually lingering on his shattered temples. From the cuts that were not burned by the fire a red liquid flowed rapidly staining the tender palms. It was getting more serious. It seemed to her that Ludger could vanish in an instant. The mans body was light and weightless it was believed from the loss of liters of blood and his face was pale as if death itself Selina then turned around to reach the hem of the pink dress and rip the fabric to shreds. First it was necessary to treat the wound or just in case apply a tourniquet or bandage.Suddenly the weight on her knees disappeared turning into a light pressure. Frightened Selina turned back to see a pile of her colleagues tattered clothes and nothing else. ...er Sir Ludger The words were out of her mouth before she realized what she was saying. Unoccupied hands gripped the mens clothing tightly accidentally catching on something warm small and quivering inside them.With a cry the strong grip of the fingers quickly weakened dropping something strange to the ground The dirty things rolled across the plain in a ball instead landing in one of the particularly deep craters. The sound of a dull fall softly shook the clearing.Selina did not know how long she sat in a stupor not daring to get up and move on. What would she say to others And to the teachers and to the children... to his family and friends and God forbid to his partner. What would she say to herself after all A scoundrel and a passive killer thats what Dont delay and there would be enough time to help Ludger. Instead all that is left of the man now are scraps of expensive fabric and something grubby between them.The woman feebly directed her way checking each hole for the presence of the rest of her personal belongings. Perhaps what she was holding was the main clue to this tragic story So Selina had to collect all the available clues and then find a way out.She took another look at the crater next to her. Two melancholy irises sparkled in the darkness merging with the black curtain. Like two great pearls they sparkled with a pearly glow in the daylight but they were so dead that even a fish would drown. Dead but suffering which means they are still alive. Selina wanted to look away and never look back. The Abyss in reality was already watching her with its empty holes instead of eye sockets. It didnt ask where it was or what happened. The strange creature simply merged with the darkness of the pit. Time passed but not after a minute nor after two or three not a single rustle was heard. ...in order a whisper unreasonably high left her closed lips. The answer did not come to Selina quickly barely audible due to the distance and the ground which naturally muffled any sound. Unfortunately the words could not be deciphered correctly and the creature would not make further attempts at communication sitting deep underground waiting for a counterattack or something.Selina felt an unpleasant chill run down her spine. Was it strange to stand like that Really amazing. Just standing in the middle of a burnt forest and talking to something. A few bitter tears of resentment fell behind the wind irrigating the ground alone with wet circles. She wanted to turn back time.,Not Rated,also academy studentsNot betame and the translator app are done with this text for goodit sounds like an idea to improve my skills so don't take it seriouslylots of inspiration and spoilersdon't beat me better cry for Heathcliff
https://archiveofourown.org/works/45538423,midnight escapades,So Ludgernim really was a soldier Selina mumbled trailing off before asking the man himself.What was it like in the militaryIt doesnt matter.Ludger hadnt actually been a part of the military so there wasnt anything he could say although perhaps it was similar to his time as a mercenary. His colleague still gave him a respectful look praising him. However Ludgers eyes were locked onto a shiny object out of sight shrouded by plants and shrubs.Hm What are you looking at LudgerssiNothing.And so they continued on their festival patrol. The festival ended.Quasimodos flames vanished with Esmeralda leaving an oblivious Selina to wonder where that dark half of hers went.It was ultimately a success to Ludger but there was still more to be done. What was that object in the bushes He was finally released injuries fully healed. In the cover of night he went on patrol to investigate what he saw that day. Fireflies roamed the field of grass Ludger stepped into. The moon shone down on him supplying little light. A cool breeze carried leaves through the air drifting. It was quiet only the flutter of the wind and chirping cicadas filling the silence.The moment it entered his sight he was hit with a pang of nostalgia and disappointment. Long lost melodies of his time on Earth and the only hobby he enjoyed when he wasnt studying.It was simply a piano. He muttered nearly wanting to leave. But its been so long I didnt even know this world had any. He recalled his days spent studying playing music simply his life before he came to such a strange and new world. There were maybe some regrets but it wasnt like he could change anything at this point. The man stood still hand outstretched. Reluctantly with a sigh Ludger waved his hand and a chair raised from the earth. He took a seat resting his hands on the keys.Just one song wouldnt hurt Tessie cant we just come back tomorrow Its past curfewNo I need to find my purse Tch I cant believe I lost it like thatThe usual trio consisting of Aidan Tayce and Leo wandered the school. During the festival Tayce had dropped her purse somewhere yet she only realized it days later. So of course she had to drag her friends to help find it but they wouldve joined her regardless. A faint sound of music carried by the wind caused Leo to perk up.Do you guys hear that He tried to locate the direction it was coming from walking towards the sound of piano keys.Huh Wait why would there be music this late The instrument was soon joined by a voice that sounded oddly similar. This caused the trio to hurry but still being wary of not being found out. Be my only one The name I want to call you by Lets hold hands and walk along The voice was low and slightly gravelly. It was hard to hear from a distance but the gap was slowly closing as the trio approached the mysterious singer.What language even is that Tayce whispered to the other two as they neared the bushes that surrounded the clearing.Hey dont they sound kind of familiar though Leo tried to focus on when he had heard such a voice. On rainy nights Yeah Where Aidan bursted before Tayce covered his mouth forcing him to be quiet. He mouthed an apology. Thankfully the person didnt notice too immersed in their own music. Or on lonely days Please colour me with your shiny light The trio finally reached the bushes cautiously peeking through them.They did not expect the person to be playing and singing to such a soft song to be the one and only Ludger Chelysie. Ill do better when you promise me we will stay together Theres That cant be him Tayce whisperyelled. Leo and Aidan agreed. This was after all the usually cold and unrelenting Ludger a man unafraid to point out the smallest mistakes someone who would even stand against Duke Lumos. For someone like him to have such a side Now I believe Lalalalala I sing a song like this With the one I was desperately looking for My oh my oh my oh my love The three students sat in admiration. Who knew he could sing so well Not to mention the instrument he was playing seemed to be the summary of their thoughts as they enjoyed the performance. Be my only love Every step we take Its like a dance we perform together My oh my oh my oh my love Be my only love On another side of the small clearing hid a trembling Sedina her eyes sparkling. First Order you truly are amazing Maybe if I share this the students will accept him more She held a magical device that silently captured the magical scene of Ludger under the night sky surrounded by only nature and the sound of his song. Be my only one I dont have to hide my feelings anymore The words I sincerely wanted to say I say I love you A bug climbed up Tayces leg unnoticed before taking a bite. She flinched from the sudden pain causing the bushes to rustle. They werent as lucky as before with Ludger stopping the music and looking in their direction. Crap were so screwed He stood walking towards the bushes. The trio were shaking knowing it was hopeless to try escape him. The leaves crunched as they were exposed to the icy look of Ludger.What are you three doing hereIll add more penalty pointsWe were only looking for Tayces purse Aidan rushed to get it out not wanting to receive any more penalty points. Tayce nodded adding on to what he said.Yeah But suddenly we heard Professors beautiful music and couldnt help staying and listening Unfortunately the flattering did not work as Ludger trudged on.It is past curfew. You should look for lost property during the day. Five penalty points for each of you. The trio looked exasperated but they had to accept fate as it was. Well what are you doing out here playing music in the middle of the night was what Leo wanted to say but he didnt want to take the risk of getting more penalty points.Now return to your dorms.Yes sir The three walked away but werent as gloomy. After all it was still such a rare discovery. Ludgers ability to sing play the piano and then combine it all in another language. His voice accompanied by the music lingered in their minds.Meanwhile Sedina had used the opportunity to escape without warranting any penalty points. Or so she thought because Ludger had still given her five penalty points the next day. Thank goodness Korean isnt a known language It would have been much more embarrassing. Had it not been for remnants of nostalgia towards that song he would have chosen otherwise. It was also the first that came to mind. Nonetheless it was nice. Oh but he didnt know the trouble Sedina was about to start for him As he roamed the halls the students that walked by looked at him with an odd sense of awe gossiping among themselves. Naturally Ludger showed no reaction but still found it strange.Class went normally until the end.Your homework will be to review what we learnt in class today. Any questionsIt was silent before one courageous student put their hand up.YesWhat was the song you sang in that videoEveryone looked towards their professor awaiting a response. Ludger appeared confused.What videoThe one all over the forums with the pianoThat does not matter. Class is adjourned.The students left now even more desperate for information. This left Ludger to ponder how they became aware of his momentary escapade to music. Sedina Who else would try to make Ludger look more favourable I dont think its even working In the end it would only be some interesting gossip thatd eventually pass over.When he arrived to have lunch there were less gazes but some remained. Even Selina had questioned him.When he met with the principal she continued to pester him about it.Even weeks after the ordeal he was annoyed by students and teachers alike even people from music schools.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/46639645,child's play,Evacuate the students to a safe place Ill hold up here.Understood.Though Selina was reluctant to leave Ludger behind she knew that the situation was urgent and it was no time to be worrying after all he used to be in the military and had already displayed his overwhelmingly skilful control of magic.She hurried the students protecting them from the barrage of incoming projectiles with her spirits as they left the scene. Now I dont have to hold back. Ludger faced the assailants who dared to trespass on Soren Academy and stir up such a mess the silhouette of a voided cloak appearing behind him. He continued to conjure barriers looking for an opening to attack the three people donning black hoods and masks obscuring their identity from view.Unfortunately life had other plans as he spotted a collapsed student with familiarly grey hair on the edge of his peripherals.And he wasnt the only one who noticed.The masked intruders broke into a sprint aided by the casting of wind magic rapidly approaching themIn a state of panic Ludger casted a doublelayered barrier rushing to save the student.But it had been predicted as the two who had originally boosted the third with wind spells casted offensive magic as the barriers shattered from the simultaneous rapidfiring of magic.Crap he mentally exclaimed expecting to take a blow but instead was hit by a powder. He instantly covered her mouth and nose with his hand. Though the student who he recognized as Rene with a sigh of relief was safe he had inhaled some of the unknown matter and thus was put at risk. Ill have to end it quickly.The ground broke into fragments as hands carved from the earth rose to capture the trespassers. It was an unexpected restraint but was not the last as vines erupted from the nearby vegetation holding them in place.Although he was beginning to grow concerned at his shaky vision and how lightheaded he felt.Mr Ludger are you alright He could hear Rene as he slowly dropped to the floor attempting to cast more magic but unable to. Thankfully he noticed the aide of spirits meaning that one of the animism professors must have come to help. Student what happened here He got hit by some strange powder. God damn it was I always this weak The last fragments of any remaining vision he had disappeared as his consciousness faded fully collapsing to the ground.Is it just my imagination or has Mr Ludger shrunkWell this is a poison we have had yet to encounter... The doctor anxiously replied to Elisha who was dead set on observing an unconscious Ludger lying on a hospital bed within the school medical bay. His vitals are stable but he has yet to regain consciousness Though the poison itself intrigued her she was more concerned about what effect it may have on their Head of Planning.Suddenly his figure had disappeared.Huh Where did heOr more accurately had disappeared inside the shirt he had originally worn which now looked more like a dress draped over a tiny Ludger who was slowly opening his strangely scarlet eyes rubbing at them with hands that were now half their original size.He sluggishly sat up weakly turning to face Elisha and the doctor who were blaringly gawking at him.The man no more rather child slowly blinked at them with dull hollow cardinal eyes.He glanced at his surroundings and came to the realization that he was not where he was supposed to be.Thus he returned his gaze to Elisha whose golden eyes that exuded a sense of authority gave him the instinct that she was the one in charge or at least would know more.Which turned out to be correct as she whispered something unheard to the doctor the man quickly leaving.Finally the child spoke in a quiet and unfamiliar voice.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/47038357,√âcoute Ch√©rie,Simplicity has its limits your interests dull my eyes Grander had said monotonously carefully watching and waiting to prey on the reaction of her disciple.Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder he replied with a classic proverb not daring to further disappoint the elder.Their journey to the city of a nearby country had encountered a dead end. The two countries they were traveling between recently advocated the existence of an old argument which in the current period of time was almost akin to an indirect declaration of war. For that sole purpose nearly all transportations between the once bustling joint road had ceased and the path that touched the horizon was enveloped in a calm silence.The only reason Grander wasnt irked by the fact she had to walk on her two limbs was that the usual blaring sun was nowhere to be seen and in its place was warmcoloured clouds.It might rain.It wont the elder swiftly cut off her disciple.Under the pretense of sore feet Grander had insisted on a break by the sidewalk. However there was no actual pain from her flesh or skin she merely brought up the idea when she noticed her disciple intently staring at the skyline longingly. Not that shell ever admit to noticing.I suppose they arent too bad these flowers. Carnations was it.Dianthus the flower of gods.Who do you take me for.The two sat in a comfortable silence. The silhouette of the sun that had been cast away by the clouds began its descent turning the sky to an orangepinkish hue. The young disciple never took his eyes off the blooming flowers. His mind lurked from places of beyond as he stared at the patch of flowers that stretched further than he could see.Wouldnt it be a beautiful sight....to die amongst these flowers the disciple unknowingly muttered to himself.Grander pictured a grotesque image of a bloodied body amongst the pink and white petals. It wasnt hard to let her imagination run amok considering all the dead bodies she has seen. The image generated by her creativity was illicitly ethereal. The beauty of the field hid the body and even when blood began seeping from the wounds it merely blended in the background. The painting wouldve been drawn by the most skilled artist to spotlight the flowers making the body a miniscule background detail.I dont believe so. Death would only terrorise and destroy the only purity these blossoms have. Youll rob them of their beauty Grander spoke the opposite of her thoughts while crushing the flower she had held between her fingers.The disciple sighed not surprised by the response.It was a fleeting thought he sarcastically replied.He got up and dusted the pollen from his clothes. The magic in the atmosphere danced around lightly so he was surprised to feel it accumulate in one area.What are youHe carefully turned around preparing himself for an incoming attack when something was gently placed on his head.doing...It suits you Grander whispered to the breeze.His hand gently brushed against the product of her magic. The stems of the chrysanthemums intertwined with each other forming a large crown that delicately rested atop his head. A spark of surprise emerged on the disciples face followed by tiny giggles that turned to faint coughs.How kind of you a small smile unconsciously placed itself on his lips.Grander was taken aback by the display of emotions forgetting that his disciple had always been only a mortal.This takes away the fun though.I do not indulge in the pleasures of mortality.I meant experiencing the struggle of stringing these together.Stringing what together.The young man could only sigh reminiscing in the simple memories of his past life. He thought about his various attempts to create a flower crown as a child for his beloved sister. The feeling of frustration that grew when those tiny stems snapped in half or when the petals fell from their places. The vivid memories stored away in the darkest pits of his heart shrouded him in melancholy.Grander noticed the shift in the atmosphere yet her unenlightenment in the aspect of humanitarian sentiments rendered her silent.As the bright sky gradually grew darker the pair once again began their walk on foot neither willing to challenge the dangers the night brought.The silence turned into ringing that blared through his eardrums. The full moon peered through the clouds its luminescent light projecting itself upon the meadow that was the horizon. Words have yet to be exchanged amongst the two each indulging in their own thoughts. When the gleaming lights of the city came into view the luscious gardens of nature and the raw light of fireflies were nowhere to be seen.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/20098381,Baby Steps,Several minutes after midnight I finally dragged myself to the front door and tiredly waved my cardkey in front of the locking mechanism. A little red light told me Id improperly held the card or something. Groaning I tried a second time. This time thankfully the light was green. I grasped the handle and pulled the door open. The apartment sat in silent darkness. I shuffled inside shutting the door quietly and tossed my things on the couch. Not caring to put anything away I turned and ambled into the kitchen. I yanked open the fridge door and skimmed the shelves for something palatable at this time of night. Nothing caught my fancy so I grabbed an egg roll and opted to just make myself a cup of tea really quickly. I munched on the egg roll without heating it. A mug from the draining rack served as an easy teaholder so I snatched it up tossed in a bag of oolong tea and filled up the water heater. In a couple of minutes I had boiling water and was steeping the tea. I finished up the egg roll. Since I didnt want to drink straight tea I dumped some sugar into the water and mixed in a little bit of soy milk. I sat myself down on the couch and started to rummage through my backpack. The notebook I was looking for was on the bottom. I groaned and slipped it out turning the lamp on next to me to help me read. I took a sip of the tea and tried to focus on my notes. The words all looked blurry to me. Just let me focusplease My desperate plea came out sounding like a cry. I couldnt help it. I was only out and awake because I didnt want to fall asleep. Some days were worse than others. There were days when I thought that I was over it allthe trauma the nightmares. But on days or rather nights like tonight my mind reminded me that I might never be free of the ghost that was the culmination of my rocky past. Here I was trying to build a life for myself despite the hard times Id faced. Sure I had friend and a support system. I didnt know how to make use of them though. The friends Id made from my time in the death game all smiled and seemed fine. Yet here I was shaking quietly on the couch at almost one in the morning trying to sip tea and read mechatronics notes to calm myself down and erase the images of the lives Id taken so long ago. Suddenly I felt arms wrap around me. Guilt tugged at my heart. I hadnt meant to wake her up. Since wed moved in together I hadnt once let Asuna see me like this. I wanted to put on a brave face for her. She pulled me to her. I set down the tea and curled up against her feeling like a small child. Is everything okay she whispered. I just numbly shook my head. Being honest with her was the best option now. If I wanted to live my life with her she had to see the side of me that wasnt a fictional hero in some game. Id feared letting her see this vulnerable side of me filled with mistakes and worries and uncertainties. But she didnt seem mad or taken aback by this behavior. She just held me tightly in her arms and stroked my hair. I was getting worried she said. You kept leaving bed in the middle of the night. I was wondering what was wrong. Im sorryIm sorry I mumbled. She shook her head and ran her fingers through my hair again. I clutched her shirt in my hands. I tried to take a deep breath. Dont be sorry she said. I think weve tried a little too hard to pretend were okay to each other. At some point after we met we decided that our own problems werent ones that we wanted to burden the other with but the truth is that we need to share with each other to heal. Even after saying that I think she knew I didnt want to talk. She helped me up and coaxed me into the bathroom to clean myself up. I didnt feel like putting much on. I was emotionally exhausted and just opted for slipping into a clean pair of underwear after a quick shower. When I was done Asuna made sure I came back into the bedroom with her. We laid down on the bed facing each other. I didnt want to look her in the eyes. She reached over and brushed some of my hair behind my ear. Her hand traveled down my cheek and rested on my chest just above my heart. A smile finally appeared on her face. She pushed herself forward and kissed me. Feel a little calmer she asked. I just nodded. Good she said. Get some good rest Kiritokun. My eyes slipped closed as I mumbled goodnight. To my relief it was a dreamless sleep. My mind and body rested without interruption from night terrors. When I woke up I found myself tangled up with Asunas body cuddling her gently. I smiled and carefully pulled her to me embracing her as she slept. Thank you I whispered. I dont know how long I just laid there holding her as she slept. I didnt want to move. This was a comfortable safe place. Although I chuckled as I thought about now versus when wed met in SAO. She would have killed me on the spot for being pressed up against her like this. My laughter must have woken her up. She groaned and lifted her face off of my chest. I smiled at her. She smiled back at me. Breakfast I asked. She shook her head and shoved her face back into my chest. Just a few more minutes she pleaded. I wasnt going to argue. Id been awake for a bit longer than she had. Id been here enjoying the simple joy of holding her close. Now she wanted a chance to do the same. We hadnt been able to do this alone for very long. It was only our third week in our new home. A lot of the reason wed saved up and moved out was to be alone. But I think it was also a desire to take the next step in our relationship. What are you thinking about she hummed. I shrugged. Oh just life I guess I said. This is what we wanted after all. To come to the real world and have a life together. To enjoy loving each other and someday grow old together. She nodded in agreement. All I wanted was to have a family with you she said. And now I have that. I felt my pulse quicken just a little bit. What did she mean by that Logically a family could be just a husband and wife. We werent legally married yet but we planned to save up and finally tie the knot in the near future. But the way a lot of people used that term today it usually meant that there were children involved. I awkwardly laughed. Yeah Im sure Yui would like a visit from us today I said. It is Saturday. Dont get me wrongAsuna and I loved the idea of being parents. And Id expressed interest in the future possibility of giving Yui a little sister to her before. But lately the idea almost felt like pressure. My mother had asked a few times if Asuna and I had been considering having a baby. Only after she started laughing at me had I realized my face was bright red with embarrassment. No way was I ready for that sort of thing. Asuna hummed and rolled onto her back. I gazed at her. She had a funny look on her face. I suddenly remembered last night. I sat up and grasped her left hand. She turned her attention back to me giving me a small smile. Im sorry if I scared you last night I said. The hope was that this would change the topic. It did not. Oh no she said. Its okay But youre diverting Diverting fromwhat I asked trying to play stupid. She gave me a look. She knew me well enough now to know when I was trying to avoid a topic. When I didnt admit that I was trying to divert the topic Asuna sat up and turned to me placing a hand on my shoulder. Ive been thinking she said. And a part of it does have to do with last night. We both ended up feeling better after taking in Yui in SAO. Dont you think that trying to take care of a child in the real world might help as well I felt a pit form in my stomach. What was she saying Yui wasnt the same as a real child. Yui didnt take nearly the same amount of responsibility that an actual baby did. Thinking about last night made it worse. I wasnt mentally ready to deal with this sort of task. How could she find it helpful She squeezed my shoulder. Kirito youve always fared better when you had someone you felt like you had to protect she said. Even though it can stress you out a little. Stress me out That wasnt even the bottom of it. There were people Id said I would protect who didnt make it. I instinctively grasped her arms and stared down at the bed between us. She let out a surprised sound. Kiritokun I shook my head. SachiEugeo I stammered. II cant I cant promise to protect someone and fail again. The words just wouldnt leave my mouth. I was so scared of my own failures that I couldnt even verbalize them to the most important person in my life. How pathetic was that Here she was claiming that Id be happier with someone to protect when one of the things that kept me up at night was the fear of vowing to protect someone and watching them die yet again. I shook my head again. Kirito you need to prove to yourself that you can she said. But most importantly you need to understand that you dont have to hold yourself to that. You need to understand that were a team. You dont have to do all of the protecting because Im going to do it too. I lifted my head and locked eyes with her. Those eyes screamed confidence. She believed not just in herself but in us. While I was a mess thinking that I would never be good enough to protect and raise a child she had full faith in us as possible parents. She moved her hand from my shoulder and cupped my cheek with it. I leaned my head into her palm taking a deep breath. Of course Im not going to force it she said softly. If you think youre not ready for a baby we dont have to try. I just think it would be good for us. I swallowed. It was obvious from the way she was saying this that she wanted a baby. The last thing I wanted to do was break her heart and tell her I needed more time. I let go of her arms and took her head in my hands. I pulled her close so that I could rest my forehead against hers. She stroked my cheek with her thumb. Letlet me think about it I said. I dont feel ready but If youre not ready thats okay she told me. I shook my head. Just let me think it over I said. I dont know that Ill ever be ready. Its a scary thought. She hummed. No matter when we choose to do it Im going to feel like Im just not ready. So let me think it over. Is that alright Asuna nodded and wrapped her arms around me tightly embracing me. Theres no rush. We can take our time thinking about it. Her words felt like sweet relief. I at least had a chance to really truly think about it. I just hoped that I could come to the right decision with her. Our embrace ended and I gave her an apologetic smile. Nowdo you want some breakfast Asuna asked. I laughed. I asked you that ten minutes ago I said. She giggled then leaned over and touched her nose to mine. But now were not cuddling she teased. Suddenly she leapt out of the bed and flashed me a playful grin. Bet you cant get to the kitchen before me she said. Oi no fair I said scrambling out of the bed and dashing after her. This is a small apartment and your sides closer to the door Laughing I caught up to her just as she entered the kitchen space. I wrapped my arms around her from behind and planted a kiss on her neck. She gleefully announced her victory. I told her that her prize would be that I made her breakfast while she got to relax. She insisted wed cook together since we had the time. We set about getting everything ready for making omelets. Just as I grabbed out the milk carton I heard my phone ring. I excused myself and walked into the hall to check the number. I grimaced but I answered it nonetheless. What do you want I growled. Oh Kirigaya Good youre awake I covered my eyes with my hand and sighed. Yeah Im up and Im making breakfast with Asuna I grumbled. What do you want at this hour Kikuoka The man on the other end of the line seemed to completely ignore my implication that I wanted to be left alone to spend time with Asuna. After the whole Project Alicization incident Id made it a point to avoid Kikuoka Seijirou at all costs but some tiny part of me always told me to pick up the phone. I gripped the phone tightly. Asuna didnt know I was still in contact with him even to this extent. Guilt filled my belly. Are you perhaps interested in research on the Brain Implant Chip he asked. I swallowed. I had two choices. I could tell him no insist that I didnt want to be bothered by him ever again and go about my life trying to get into fulldive technology on my own merits through school. Or I could say yes and possibly get enough money to support Asuna and myself and if we chose to have them our future children. A little voice told me not to as I glanced back in Asunas direction. But... Tell me what you want I said. And then Ill give you my answer.,Mature,This was supposed to be fluff dammitbut here we areI made a complex plot of itPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder - PTSDFamily PlanningCanon Compliant ViolenceFluff and AngstAlternate Universe - Canon DivergenceAlicization SpoilersSpoilersPregnancy

https://archiveofourown.org/works/45664510,Accel America 3: Rescue the Princess,1 Rick Billings was all things considered a little nervous. Now this wasnt particularly uncommon. So many things had occurred in Ricks life over the past few months that his most recent experiences had all consisted of one bout of nervousness to the next. And it wasnt like he lived the most exciting life before all this. That said at least his friends had begun to expect it now. Before they tended to be surprised at the state of his nerves as far as he assumed anyway. But the reason for his alarmed nerves this time made perfect sense to him. He was about to embark on a mission to recruit an unknown element into his ranks and he was doing it all alone. Everything for him had started two months and some change ago when Lisa Pak his best and at the time only friend had allowed him to copy a strange program onto his neurolinker. Even as he thought about it Rick toyed with the small computer that sat at the base of his neck and linked directly to his brain waves through some kind of quantum interface whatever THAT meant. But not knowing anything about the fairly recent jump in technology didnt prevent him from enjoying using it and not long after their commercial availability around sixteen or seventeen years prior almost everything in society had restructured itself to accommodate the use of neurolinkers. They were used in just about every facet of everyday life from banking to making prescription glasses no longer necessary to providing information on any building in the city that was within your view. Rick however only had eyes for that amazing program that Lisa had given to him. Sure he regularly used other programs and apps in his daily routine but all of them paled in comparison to the supersecret game Brain Burst 2039. Called Brain Burst or just B.B. by those lucky few who could play it both the game itself and the programming behind it were amazing. But more than that it granted the power of acceleration. Even now after nine weeks Rick still got a slight shot of adrenaline when he thought about it. Of course nothing is quite that simple even for a seventh grader. If the game and acceleration were all that there was to it Rick wouldve been quite the happy camper After all hed met some really cool people playing that game an entire community of Burst Linkers Hed even met his first ever girlfriend because of it All these different factors had joined together to slowly break him out of the shell hed closed around himself for most of his life. But the political structure of Brain Burst was a completely different animal and sadly Ricks Legion Master known as a Governor was at the center of it though not through any fault of her own. Still because of choices that had been made by those not wanting to be involved an innocent had been abducted and now Rick and his friends needed to make it right. The only saving grace was that the kidnapping had occurred in the Accelerated World not the real one. Hence the need to recruit and the reason for Ricks nervousness as he sat on a bench near the center of Central Park. Checking the clock display at the top left of his vision he saw that it was nearly 230 PM that Saturday afternoon in midmay. Almost time. Sitting there waiting he watched a young family walk by enjoying the warm spring air. It had rained last night but luckily it wasnt humid at all. Rick himself let the sun beam down on his average arms and legs knowing he was going to turn pink before the day was out. Hed forgotten to put on sunscreen again When the time finally came when his digital alarm that only he could hear sounded he took a deep breath and closed his eyes though neither was necessary. Burst Link he whispered hoping that the few people near enough to hear were too engaged in other activities. Last thing he needed was to be the guy who outdated Brain Burst to the rest of the world As soon as the final word ended with that hard K the world around him and all the people and animals in it came to an almost complete stop. Not only that but everything he could see from the grass to the trees to the sun itself was colored a dark blue. Including himself which he could now see as his personal home avatar stepped out and gazed at this virtual world created by accelerating with the Brain Burst program. Of course this blue frozen world wouldnt exist without the aid of the hundreds of thousands of public cameras that blanketed the entire city of NYC which the program somehow managed to hack into and overwrite. He still didnt understand how that worked While accessing this virtual world Rick could activate Brain Burst to challenge others to duels check the status of his avatar and look to see how many Burst Points he had. He could also use his normal computers desktop while the world was frozen around him allowing him to surf the global net and complete homework assignments in a fraction of normal time He clicked on the bright flaming B icon that appeared whenever he accelerated and his options menu appeared. Scrolling through the various features including things like tag team setups and Battle Royal mode Rick deactivated his Gallery a feature that would allow nearby Burst Linkers to watch the matches that occurred around them. What he was planning was more of a meeting than a fight so he didnt need a bunch of avatars hooting and hollering. That done he opened the Challenge Board which listed all the Burst Linkers who were within his range to duel. As the Saturday afternoon was quite pleasant he wasnt the least bit surprised to see an extra large number of names appear though he was looking for a single specific name. Luckily they were listed in order from highest level to lowest and he found the name he was looking for right where he expected it to be with the level 4s. He highlighted the name with a finger and took a deep breath before selecting the DUEL option. The blue still world of Central Park as well as all the people and things in it vanished. In their place appeared well not a lot as it turned out. Instead of the hustle and bustle of New York City and its amazing skyline there was nothing but a rolling grassland as far as the eye could see. Not a single tree was visible on the horizon and a gentle breeze blew across the wide savannah causing the waisthigh grass to ripple like waves in the sea. A Grassland Stage. And because there were no obstructions he could easily see his invited guest even if the tall grass nearly covered her short childsized avatar. Rick checked his avatars hands just to make sure. He confirmed that they were indeed covered with the copper armor that hed grown accustomed to the once gleaming armor covered in the browns reds and greens that gave his avatar its name Copper Tarnish. Sure starting a duel or being thrust into one caused the game to automatically create your avatar armor and all but he just knew that the one time he didnt check was the one time it didnt happen. Without wasting another second about thirty had passed while he made his observations he began to run towards his opponent waving with one hand up. Actually it was more of a power walk since the tall grass impeded most of his leg speed. Luckily his opponent was coming closer as well Or unluckily as it turned out since he suddenly noticed the small duel avatar pull a pistol out of the holster on her belt and point it at him. Instinctively Rick dove for cover under the grassy canopy as he heard a shot ring out over the quiet of the stage. From his prone position he edged his way closer using an armystyle crawl on his belly. Hed fought enough long distance types to know to take cover whenever you could When he judged hed gone far enough he lifted both arms up over the grass in an obvious sign of surrender. I only want to talk he called out. Well geez Tarn a girls voice drawled closer than hed expected then get up and talk I aint seen or heard from ya since that fight against Talon two months back and you suddenly challenge me to a fight I figured you wanted to celebrate bein level 4 with a duel against yours truly. She glanced around the stage for a few seconds. Though I guess you askin me to turn off my Gallery probly shoulda been a hint. Slowly Rick rose from the high grass hands still up. Before him stood an avatar that came up to about his chest if you included the hat and her gun was still pointed right at him She sighed. Here you invite me to Central Park I thought we could have ourselves a good ol tussle She spun the gun around her finger and holstered it just like the cowgirl her avatar made her out to be. Rick had to admit her appearance still threw him off even after all the odd shaped avatars hed seen while playing B.B. She was dark pink with armor that flared out at the ankles to resemble horse riding chaps while the torso wore a sleeveless vest with a pattern across it. Arop her head sat a small ten gallon hat and pink hair that looked tied back in a tail. From top to bottom Raspberry Revolver looked like a little cowgirl. Slightly embarrassed Rick scratched at the back of his head a gesture he could feel even though his head was covered by a helmet his face covered by a shield only he could see through. How uh hows it going Raspberry Revolver Long time no see huh The girl let out an exasperated sigh and put a hand on her hip. Call me Razz okay He nodded. Sure thing And thanks Razz. Raspberry Revolvers a mouthful. Sos Copper Tarnish she replied. And its good to see ya and all but if we aint fightin then say what you gotta say so we can skedaddle Whats the rush he asked playfully. Got a hot date or something She laughed nervously as she scratched at the back of her own head. Well truth be told It took a second before what she said registered to Rick but then his eyes grew wide. What But but youre just a kid Arent you like seven or something Hey she yelled indignantly stepping forward and thrusting her chest out. Im eight Plus hes cute So its almost a crime NOT to hang out with him and let him buy me ice cream Anyway she shook her head this aint about me What do ya need We were having a nice conversation about stuff when ya interrupted so out with it. As opposed to a conversation about nothin Rick wondered. Also you knew I was going to challenge you to a duel You shouldve been ready But outwardly he closed his eyes and let out a sigh. Okay heres the deal Razz. We the Crystal Conclave need your help. There was silence for a few seconds before Razz spoke up. With Rick blinked. Oh right. Sorry. Uh lets see. Have you heard any rumors about the Slip Circuit recently This large Legion was located in Queens and was a rival to Ricks own Legion the Crystal Conclave. Razz shrugged. Some stuff here and there. Not much. Then Ill just come right out and say it he replied. Peach Parfait Senator of the Slip Circuit and second in command has been abducted in the Accelerated World by the Lupus Guard and is currently their prisoner. Horse hockey the cowgirl laughed. Shoot even Silver Lupus aint THAT crazy Get any direct evidence of that itd start a war. Both the Guard and the Circutve signed the Accords everyone knows that If its true all the other Accorded Legions would have to attack the Guard up in the Bronx. Right Rick agreed which is why the Lupus Guard has covered their tracks really well. There is no direct physical evidence. But my Governor spoke with Pewter Slip in the real I might add and shes confirmed it. She let out a chuckle. And how does ol Slip know fer sure Peach Parfait is her child. Raspberry Revolver was quiet after this revelation. The bond between a Parent Burst Linker the one who allowed the upload of Brain Burst and their child the downloader was a near unbreakable bond due to the fact that the game couldnt be shared wirelessly a direct connection of neurolinkers was required. This meant that parent and child needed to know each other and trust each other implicitly. After a few seconds of silence Razz shook her head. Well damn. Thats gotta suck something fierce. Right Rick agreed nodding. And with no evidence Pewter Slip cant get her Legion mobilized to attack or SHED be in violation of the Accords. Itd throw the entire Accelerated World into chaos Razz looked right into the faceplate of Copper Tarnish and shook her head. Aw hell Tarn dont tell me Yep The Conclave is mounting a rescue Its called Operation Save the Princess Hand hit forehead as Razz groaned and facepalmed at the horrible joke of a name for a rescue operation. Does Crystal Seraph know about this Rick laughed. It was her idea Course it was she muttered. She paced and shook her head for a second before stopping suddenly and slowly turning to face the copper avatar in front of her. It seemed like she finally understood the point of this entire conversation. She pointed her tiny finger at him in defiance. No Oh no You aint draggin ME into the Lupus Guard Oh cmon Rick pleaded stepping forward. We only have six people in our Legion right now And nobody with the longrange abilities of a red color Your support from pretty much anywhere on the battlefield could be invaluable Invaluable or not I aint gettin on Silver Lupus naughty list That guy gives me the creeping heebiejeebies and I aint even met the guy And not a Im shakin in my boots in my boots kinda feelin either. Im talkin a legit deep down in my gut bad feelin. That guys got more moren one screw loose and his followers aint all that much better. Which is why we need to help Peach Parfait. Rick countered. You know Silver Lupus is a stickler for tradition and the status quo. You know as soon as Crystal Seraph became a Governor of a Legion larger than his he was going to try and crush her. And when Pewter Slip refused to help him he punished her. Its not Peach Parfaits fault that she got caught up in our mess. Your mess Razz said not mine. Besides Rick said slyly do you know how many other red avatars I couldve gone to for help How many of them want to stick it to the Lupus Guard They cowgirl let out a barking laugh. Then go to them But theyre not you I chose you because youre a good fighter. Youve got amazing instances and you think fast when things get dicey. Thats what we need for this. Layin it on a little thick aint ya she chuckled. Course I aint sayin youre wrong. He laughed back embarrassed. Okay he conceded maybe Im hamming it up a little but that doesnt make what Im saying untrue. You were literally the only distancetype I thought of when we were told to find allies. Razz suddenly perked up. Allies As in more than one Well yeah but I wasnt planning on inviting your coworkers that we met two months ago. No offense but that Ocean Crush guy didnt strike me as the brightest bulb in the box you know And I dont trust Teal Spike at all. He may be your boss maybe your friend but he doesnt seem the type to remain all that loyal when Burst Points are up for grabs. But Razz shook her head. Dont worry werent them I had in mind. I was thinking bout another guy I know. Level 6 good fighter ranged but not as much as me. She suddenly shook her head and turned to face Rick. I aint sayin yes she said sharply. Not til I think it out some and talk to this other Burst Linker k But I can list you as a definite maybe Rick asked hopefully. Razz let out a sigh but nodded. Aint right whats happened to Peachy. Hear shes good people. Rick let out a whoop and jumped up pistoning his first back and forth. Gotta tell ya Tarn Razz said gettin awful excited for a maybe. He laughed. You dont understand I thought I wasnt even going to get through half of my argument. As soon as I mentioned invading the Lupus Guard I figured youd fill me full of holes Why I dunno he shrugged. Just seems to be the kind of thing that happens when I make plans with beautiful women is all. Razzs eyes perked at that and she crossed her arms across her slim chest. Oh youre one a those types eh Like the smaller Ftype avatars do ya What That wasnt what hed meant at all No I mean that wasnt I didnt But I he trailed off as Razz began laughing. Calm down buddy. Im only teasin. Still Rick sighed you cant make jokes like that Ill get a reputation as a creepy guy with some kinda complex. Anyway Razz said waving her hand to return to their original topic in the unlikely event I decide to join you on this suicide mission where well probably all wind up in unlimited EK when is all this fun supposed to happen But Rick shook his head. Cant tell you unless youre officially with us. Get a response to me before Tuesday afternoon. Well be having a meeting the entire rescue force. Time and place to be sent after you join. Details will be explained there. I aint gotta join your Legion do I Nope But as a Senator of the Crystal Conclave I can extend an invitation if youd like one. And the meetins in three days she asked ignoring that last part. Rick nodded Three days. But thats a long time in the Accelerated World. It actually came out to be about nine years in the Accelerated World where time was onethousand times faster. Dont I know it brother Razz commented dryly. Rick was rather pleased with himself. This had gone MUCH smoother than he thought it would. Casually he looked at the countdown timer in the corner of his vision. The clock which had started at 1800 seconds was almost reduced by half during their conversation. So ready to declare this fight a draw so you can return to your icecream buying lover boy He stopped for a second. Why are you going out on dates anyway When I was eight I wasnt trying to get girls to go out with me. Dont worry about it she replied evasively. Anyway I was thinkin about doin that but then I figured itd be a shame to let these last fifteen minutes go to waste dontcha think He nodded. Brain Burst IS all about the duel. Itd be a shame to disappoint the Central Server wouldnt it Deep down hed hoped she was going to say something like that. Because while having the ability accelerated was cool nothing compared to the duel Whenever Rick became Copper Tarnish whenever he found himself facing off against a new opponent he simply lost himself in the duel. In the real he wasnt athletic by any stretch of the imagination but his friend and parent Lisa was and shed told him of the zone where athletes simply stopped thinking and let their muscle memory and reflexes take over. He was pretty sure that was where he went when he was in the middle of a fierce duel with an eager well matched opponent. It was like nothing else mattered except the avatar in front of him at that second. Granted that wasnt for every fight hed ever had plus it had taken time to get over a few hangups he had like fighting avatars that looked like children or particularly curvy Ftypes. But once he relaxed and let his instances take over there were times when he thought he could actually communicate with other Burst Linkers through the connection in their duels. Like he could feel their motivations the reasons they dueled their hopes and aspirations. It was like nothing hed ever felt. Rick nodded his helmeted head at Raspberry Revolver and said Well lets get this show started then Razz held her hands above the twin revolvers that hung from her belt. Well then draw pilgrim Rick looked at the digital clock in the corner of his vision as soon as he left the Accelerated World. Just like every other time not two whole seconds had passed time passing mentally 1000 times faster one half hour over there was 1.8 seconds in the real He sighed as he stretched. I almost had her he thought standing up from his bench and sticking his hands in his jean pockets. Though two months ago I never wouldve been able to fight Raspberry Revolver to a draw He decided to simply wander not having any other plans for the afternoon. The sun was bright but a cool breeze was blowing so it wasnt so bad he was sweating. As he walked he tried to organize his thoughts. He had maybe one lead and possibly a second if Razz could convince that level 6 to join them. Lisa said she had two level 5 friends that would probably agree to come and the twins Sara and Jayne had said they might know someone willing to help as well. They might have themselves a decent sized invasion force when all was said and done A beeping that only he could hear caused his thoughts to derail for a moment. Looking at the display that had suddenly popped up he saw that his girlfriend Sam was calling him. He smiled. This was a surprise Sam had told him she would probably be busy for most of the day maybe she finished early Normally he wouldnt have accepted the call facetime calls like this were expensive plus he couldnt neurospeak very well though hed been practicing but he knew she would keep it short and he was in a particularly good mood after his duel with Razz so he hit the ACCEPT button and a face popped up dominating his view. He took a step to the side to get out of the way of the multitude of people walking down the sidewalk as he couldnt continue walking Sams pretty face with auburn hair and light tan eyes and cute little button nose were taking up all of his view. Not that he was complaining Sam was way nicer to look at than a boring old Central Park sidewalk She blinked as she came into view her face one of surprise. Wow she finally said after a few seconds I didnt expect you to answer. Hi Rick. So as not to be rude to the passersby he didnt answer with his voice but with the neurospeak function. Good to see you too Sam As for the call if wwere quick the dddamage shouldnt be too bad. Her grin widened. Hey Your neurospeak is getting really good Well I was going to leave a message asking you to text or mail me but since you decided to pick up where are you Strolling through the Mall in Central Ppark he responded trying not to gaze too deeply into those beautiful eyes neurospeak was tough enough without distraction Those beautiful eyes grew wide at his answer. Wow Youre close Im at Central Park West and Columbus Circle. Im with a friend Id like to introduce so get here quick And just like that her face vanished and his view once again returned to the sidewalk. When I said we should keep it quick I didnt mean THAT quick Rick thought. Also I should reduce the size of my view window so I can see other things around me He headed west happy that hed get to see Sam and curious about who she was going to introduce him to this time.,Teen And Up Audiences,Science FictionAction/Adventure
https://archiveofourown.org/works/43483821,Accelerate: Faster than Sound,Octavia always hated school. Not because it was hard or because she was bullied. She was pretty good at just avoiding anybody troublesome so long as they werent faculty. The issue was that she hated being seen. She abhorred drawing attention to herself even the slightest look in her direction made her want to shrink deep into a hood that didnt exist to hide her face. Even though the route from her classroom to the roof was a bit longer than it needed to be she had the perfect route to avoid as many cameras as possible. Turning her face down into her sleeve when she got close. As she pushed open the door to the fenced roof littered with benches for students at lunch a breeze hit her face and brushed some of her hair out of the way. It was gentle peaceful. Naturally there were other students up here but they wouldnt pay her any mind. She took a seat on the furthest empty bench from anybody else and unwrapped the lunch she had made herself that morning. She carefully balanced the box on her lap and began eating with chopsticks in one hand while the other reached towards a screen that didnt exist in reality. A projection on her eye from her NeuroLinker. An oldstyle spellcasting roguelite game took up most of her field of vision and sound effects drowned out most of the world as she controlled it with little more than eye movements and her nondominant right hand. She never had to look down at her lunch to know what she was grabbing with her chopsticks before she brought it up to her mouth taking her time to eat without ever losing focus on her game. Octavia finished her food with time to spare so she paused her game only long enough to wrap up her bento then returned to playing her game with both hands now. She was picking up the pace no longer being so cautious with her health and instead just dodging attacks up close. If she was fast enough she could finish the second stages boss before the bell rang. Left then right. Dodge between attacks then throw out more spells. Her enemy the randomly selected Primal Wind Elemental Aethervyn kept knocking her back every time she got close enough to deal damage. The close range kit she had built up this run was difficult to work with an enemy that kept her at range. A cyclone of bladed winds spiraled out from the boss too fast for Octavia to dodge all of. Her health started to decrease rapidly but she wasnt worried yet. Health was just a resource for her to use. She maintained her playstyle trying to stay close until finally her focus was broken by another strong gust of wind blowing her hair into her eyes. She hadnt been growing it out very long she couldnt not yet. And despite it all the bit she had to be proud of had just worked against her to get her killed. Her robed mage avatar dropped to its knees defeated and lacking all health. It was like the games enemy had taken control of the real winds to thwart her. Oh well She thought. Lunch should be almost over anyways. Shouldnt start another. She closed out of the application and turned instead to the sky enjoying her respite under the sky for just a little longer. The school bell signalling the end of lunch had to come eventually though and when it did she made her way back inside last of all the students that had been on the roof. The rest of the school day went on as normal. Classes were hard as always. Not being allowed to multitask made it difficult to focus on anything at all but Octavia made due. It was more like rehearsing a routine. She wasnt living a life or doing anything special she was just going about her day like a side character that only ever gets noticed to set a scene. This was how she liked to rationalise the monotony of her life and how useless she felt she was in the grand scheme of things. Today in particular was special however. Octavia didnt know it but something was going to happen. Her perfect little play a rehearsal of an average daily routine would be broken the moment she stepped foot outside of school grounds. She disconnected from the schools net and as she did a tall brown haired girl in the schools uniform stepped off from the wall she had been leaning against. ShizukaKun. A flat voice from the side. Octavia was too zoned into the screens open on her Neurolinker to notice. ShizukaKun. ShizukaKun Wakey wakey spacey. Despite her silly turn of phrase the girl maintained the same tone of voice. Octavia finally took notice of the woman speaking to her flinching at her choice in honorifics. Its fine. She has no clue. Just play along as always. She looked up to meet the gaze of her classmate. It was difficult to recall her name though. Had they met before It took a moment for Octavia to figure out what to say awkwardly staring at the person who had disrupted her routine. Hi. Can I help you Octavias hands moved fast the translator software installed on most Neurolinkers would be able to pick it up even if the user didnt know a single sign of JSL. Octavia noticed the girl taking the time to process that this was how their conversation was going to work. It was always a certain look in their eyes. At least Octavia knew they didnt share any classes with her. The brunette nodded. You can. Would you mind coming with me for a bit Octavia took a step back. The stranger was a little too close. And looking at Octavias face too. Maintaining polite eye contact was difficult. She frowned. Its about gaming. Youre really into games right I noticed that you were playing something while eating lunch today you didnt even look at what you were eating. Octavia felt her cheeks heat up. Somebody had been watching her at lunch somebody had noticed her and what she was doing. How could she have been so careless Octavia hadnt even caught that a pair of eyes was on her at the time. The stranger quickly corrected her behaviour. Anyways I know a game that you might like. If you come with me Ill show it to you. Octavia really just wanted to go find somewhere to hide out until she had to be home. Yet there was something with this girl that struck her as plainolodd. Her atypical bluntness her behaviour when talking about games. It honestly seemed like they may have common ground. Against her better judgement Octavia closed all of the windows she had prepared to distract herself and shrugged before signing once more. Sure. Where are we going A nice little creek running through my neighbourhood. I noticed you prefer uncrowded spaces so I wont take you anywhere that people gather. Octavia sighed a breath of relief. She could probably handle direct interaction with one person for a little while. She didnt really want to go anywhere with crowds though. As the brunette started walking Octavia tapped her on the shoulder to get her attention. There was just one more question she needed to ask. Whats your name Oh that. I suppose I forgot to introduce myself perhaps it didnt strike me as terribly important in the moment. Im Furin Chikafuji. Octavia took a mental note of that name. Chikafuji. Nice to meet you. It was only polite to say so after all. Furin shook her head. Just Furin is fine. Im sure it will be easier that way. First impressions Octavia liked this girl. She was as blunt as a yankii but she was really quite perceptive and accommodating. Furin was easy to be around even if Octavia was still a little bit uncomfortable for now. Octavia and Furin walked paths both familiar and new to Octavia as Furin led her to their destination. They didnt converse much at all on the way there. Octavia simply made the effort to trace the path in her mind keeping track of where they were at all times. Her parents wouldnt be expecting her home for at least another hour so she was confident it wouldnt be an issue. When they arrived Octavia nearly ran into Furin for how suddenly she stopped. Though she had been tracing their path she hadnt been watching their surroundings. Only caring about movement in an absolute capacity not relative to any landmarks she hadnt even taken in how beautiful the area was. They were in a park probably but it was entirely empty. Some secluded corner even Octavia had never found. A creek ran before them the beautiful and clear water running between roughly rounded rocks. Trees and large brushes largely obscured the area from view as if it hadnt been taken care of in years a truly natural beauty. It smelled very nice the delicate scent of the earth after rain the vague aroma of some wildflowers growing haphazardly from the ground in no perfectly manicured way. It was peaceful. How do you like it Furin spoke snapping Octavia out of her trance. Its very pretty. I like it. Good then lets get started. She walked over to a stone with a flat enough surface to sit on a makeshift bench in a way. Furin delicately lowered herself on the rock careful to not let it catch her skirt. Octavia followed suit sitting down with altogether a bit more carelessness given the uniform she had to wear. ShizukaKun would you mind cablelinking with me Octavia was suddenly less at peace. Though her femininity was easily hidden in a physical appearance the internal voice she had trained for mental use in gaming and the like was not exactly suited to keeping up her appearances. This could cause trouble for her. And yet she felt for some reason that she could trust Furin. Octavia looked at her again really looked at her this time. Her hair was so long it made a small curl atop the rock they were using as a seat. It was perfectly kept in a giant French braid. She had small brown freckles dotting the corners of her face that Octavia could still see while she was focusing on her school bag. The ear that was turned to Octavia wore a cuff earring in a pointed shape mimicking the direction of her ear. Like an elf or some nature spirit in a fantasy world. She was still expressionless but Octavia thought she looked very nice regardless. When Furin looked up she was holding a cable for direct linking in her hand. She carefully plugged one end into her Neurolinker then offered the other side to Octavia. At that moment Octavia was certain of her decision to trust Furin even if it was a mistake. She inserted the other end of the cable into her neurolinker and nodded. Instantly Furins voice was in her mind rather than her ears. Thank you. Its better not to talk about it in the open even somewhere like this. Please think what you want to say rather than sign if you can. Octavia wasnt sure why secrecy was so important for just a game but she didnt protest. She also didnt converse. Not yet. Her courage wasnt quite there yet so she sat there and listened attentively. Ive had my eye on you for some days now. You are very careful to avoid cameras when you can and you never interact with people if you can avoid it. Its like you dont want to leave a single trace in this world. Octavia rushed to defend herself with lies but Furin silenced her without a single word just a finger to her lips. It was less the gesture itself and more the sudden closeness that caused Octavia to stop. What if I told you there was another world you could belong to A world that would let you rewrite your story and fix the things that you must hate so much about this one Rewrite.. her story. Those words struck home for Octavia. Somebody who had resigned to the role of a side character in her own life story. Playing a character convenient to the plot of others. Finally Octavia spoke with her thoughts. If there was such a world and you knew how to get there.. Id ask you to take me there Show me the way give me the key whatever form that took itd be okay with me A certain sense of desperation was conveyed in Octavias soft silvery internal voice. Conversation with speech or thoughts moved so fast she couldnt filter what she wanted to say with what she ought to say it came out too easily and she couldnt stop it. It was far too honest a method of communication. Oh I see now. Furins flat voice remained even in the direct link. It was a 11 copy of her real voice emotionless and quiet easily lost in the rest of the sounds of the worlds. Furin accessed programs invisible to Octavia on her neurolinker preparing some sort of file. When she sent it it came with the imagery of an arrow being shot from her Neurolinker to Octavias. BrainBurst the application was named. Install this game and you will be able to rewrite your very own reality. Without hesitation she accepted the installer and let it run. A game is going to do all of that Octavia asked. Ill explain after the game is installed correctly.. Thus Octavia waited looking at the stream and patiently allowing the loading bar of the application to fill up in her peripheral. It was clear when it finished because Octavia started at the loud noise accompanied by a frankly excessive amount of rusty metal and fire. Still the game had successfully installed and clearly Furin knew this. Welcome to the accelerated world ShizukaChan. Octavia was pleasantly surprised by the unquestioning switch from that more masculine honorific even cracking a smile. Moments later she forced her attention from her own validation and to the topic at hand. Brain Burst. What kind of game can rewrite reality I dont believe this would be a practical joke but... Furin shakes her head. Its not a joke. Ill show you on the count of three I want you to use the command Burst Link . One. Two. Three. Burst Link. Burst Link The world froze the colour drained out of every object in an instant leaving only shades of blue. Octavia was no longer in her physical body but instead the avatar she used for VR Dive gaming A girl with violet hair and similarly dyed fox like ears. She was dressed in a hooded lavender poncho a deep purple shirt and a plaid grey skirt. Dark leggings hid her legs and she wore furred boots. If Furin hadnt already heard her internal voice Octavia would be embarrassed somebody from school was seeing this avatar and associating it with her... but really Furin didnt seem like the type to have many people to blab it to anyways. It took Octavia longer than it should have to notice that the world had stopped. She looked around poked herself and then poked some trees. Hard as ice or stone solid to the core. Beautiful isnt it Furins voice asked from behind her. Octavia spun and saw the only other speck of nonblue colour anywhere in sight. An avatar with pointed elfin ears that was much taller than Furin herself. Her hair was the same shade of brown and in the same style but with fashionable sticks and leaves ornamenting it. She wore a long layered brown skirt with many ruffles and frills. Her top was covered in a very loose and light bellsleeved white shirt. Though the clothes looked sheer they revealed nothing of the slender frame as if there was nothing underneath at all. Furin waited patiently for Octavia to stop being a useless lesbian maintaining a completely neutral expression while observing all of Octavias reactions. The world looks as if it has stopped She finally said But really its more like we are in a Dive right now. This is a reconstruction of 3D images taken from cameras at the moment of acceleration. ... Acceleration Octavia asked. Yes acceleration. By using that command I just taught you Burst Linkers can accelerate their brain waves. Turning a moment into minutes is the least of our abilities. Some use it to cheat on tests or overcome opponents in sports. Some might even use it to become better at other video games. You get the picture. There are a lot of ways to use and abuse this power. That isnt all there is to this game but theres not much more I can show you until tomorrow. Octavia considered all the possibilities for the power and what it could mean for rewriting her reality. She was coming up with a whole lot of questions and the conclusion that she was lacking in imagination. Slowing down time for herself was amazing... but not useful to solving any of her problems. You know Ive been able to hear most of your thoughts this entire time. It would be wise to work on maintaining mental barriers around your thoughts so this doesnt happen with others but I dont mind. It makes communication easier when youre too busy overthinking everything and not talking much. Furin paused for only a beat before following herself up. Sorry. It was the first time she had apologised for being blunt so far. Not that you not talking is an issue. Even converting thoughts into more literal speech takes conscious effort it probably isnt second nature. Octavia felt wildly called out. Then she realised Furin probably could tell she felt called out. She quickly tried to silence her own thoughts so she didnt keep embarrassing herself. Sorry.. I had no idea Ive never been cable linked with anybody before. Octavias voice was suddenly meeker more bashful. She turned her face into her avatars hood shifting her feet back and forth and watching Furin only out of the corner of her eyes. Its okay Furin stated plainly I just said to you that it made things easier and I meant that. Even if you dont think in verbal words any form of thoughts will still be plain to me if you dont hide them. Anyways the real game starts tomorrow only then will you understand what I mean by rewriting your reality. Octavia nodded silently. The virtue of patience was not lost on her. Though part of her silence was absolutely being stunned by Furins empathy combined with utter bluntness. Her personality was a trip and a half to make sense of. Until we see each other tomorrow do not connect to the Global Net under any circumstance. As well as this you must sleep with your Neurolinker on if you dont already. How are we going to see each other if tomorrow is Saturday We dont have to go to school Octavia pointed out. She leaned up against a tree wrapping her arms around herself under the poncho. She kind of liked this frozen moment in time being in the body she considered to be the real her in the real world with somebody else that can see this version of her. Thats not an issue. Will you be free in the afternoon around lunch time I have Kyudo in the morning but Ill be free the rest of the day tomorrow. We can go to a quiet caf√© I like my treat. Was that an invitation for a date Octavia wasnt sure she was comfy with the idea of cable linking in a more public space lest anybody get the wrong idea. Like I said. Quiet the booths are pretty private at least. Im not taking you to the best caf√© in Nakano this time itll be too obvious that youre a new Linker and that would cause trouble for both of us. Octavia mentally kicked herself for forgetting to keep her thoughts to herself. Cable linking was far too easy to dig into an unprotected mind she noticed. Either Octavia had no idea what she was doing or Furin was too good at poking through peoples minds. Her silvery voice eked out a final response. She was still nervous but Furin had proven to be pretty reliable so far. Sure tomorrow around lunch. I wont connect to the net and Ill sleep with my Neurolinker on. Good. When youre ready use the command Burst out. Furins avatar immediately disappeared upon saying those words. Octavia followed and she was back in the real world the moment she had left it. The final thoughts conveyed through the Cable Link were simple Ill send you the details tomorrow. Dont worry I got your contact information through the direct link. That was technically a cyber crime. Octavia wondered if Furin would smile mischievously if her face seemed capable of emoting at all. Maybe Octavia was a little too far in over her head. Maybe Furin really wasnt as trustworthy as Octavia first thought. Realistically she was going to follow every instruction down to the letter and wait excitedly for Furins call to meet up. It took Octavia minutes to notice her new friend was gone without a trace like a breath of the wind.,Teen And Up Audiences,Childhood TraumaPsychological TraumaHealingFound Family TropesMentor/Prot√©g√©Major Original Character(s)Minimal Canon InvolvementTwo-Toned AvatarSingle POVslow burn found familyCanon Character CameoCanon-Typical ViolenceNew Player POVCompetent POVMute POV CharacterBut technology is awesome and circumvents the muteness partiallyI only know ASL not JSL so this might be rough and I'll only be able to describe some signsSign LanguageDisabled CharacterCanon Compliant
https://archiveofourown.org/works/41869827,The Next Level,The Normal Duel Field Purgatory Stage. Graphite Edge and Green Grandee had accelerated for a small talk using a connection that was practically impossible to break through or eavesdrop. They were discussing what should be done about Brain Burst now when Grandee suddenly brought up a different matter. Lotus she has reached Level 10 hasnt she Yes she has. Graph nodded. Then the end is here at last for Trial 2. Will it be a good end or a bad end only fate can tell this time. Grande replied speaking cryptically as always though Graph seemed to catch the hidden meaning behind his words. Just then Graph made a sudden request Guusan I think Im gonna rejoin Negabu after all. Grandee showed no expression. He didnt bother to use Judgement Blow on Graph for the treacherous words he just spoke. Even if this meant he would be losing one of the most powerful highranking members of his legion he didnt care. Instead he asked him a question Is that your will Or your parents As Graph was an Originator it didnt make sense for him to have a parent. When Grandee said parents he wasnt referring to the BB parentchild system but rather Graphs real parents who were the overseers of Brain Burst. To this Graph curtly replied To be honest Im not sure. Its just I have a soft spot for Lotta as her mentor and brother so I kinda feel obligated to see the end with her. Grandee let out a laugh quite unusual for him. WWhats so funny No if I remember correctly your parents were in a similar situation yes Right. Mama was the Vice Commander of a strong guild just like I am now. And Papa had to duel the legendary paladin Heathcliff to get her. Then Grandee exhibited a vigor he never had before. Lets recreate that legendary duel. Between me and Lotus. With you as the prize. AAre you serious What about the Sudden Death Rule That should no longer be active if shes one Level above us. If on the offchance that it does apply then Nega Nebulas can just absorb all of Great Wall. So reckless not that Im one to talk though Graph murmured. Oh speaking of Lotta He just got an alert sent to his Neurolinker through an unknown app that he used. Shes currently in Setagaya with Crow where our laboratories are. It seems shes finally searching for answers. Then this is perfect. You are free to discuss the terms with her. Artificial Fluctlight fully loaded onto Subject 20320930. Ejection process is about to commence. Mmm. Well done. At last we now have our second child Kurobakun. But is this really necessary We already have Subject 20311231 ready for whenever those games launch. She will be the one to realize our Kamuras goal in the virtual world. Having another child would just run counter to our plans. Another one wont hurt. And besides I want to see for myself what kind of hope she imagines would bloom. By the way it would be wise not to use those numbers around here. As for her name lets see How about Sayuki As the mysterious woman was chatting with her fellow researcher a young baby opened her eyes trying to comprehend the world around her. Little did she know she would be placed in a rather cruel fate. A young blackhaired girl woke up from a dream. She had tears flowing on her white face clearly sad about something but unsure of what exactly. No matter how much she tried to remember it she couldnt. She turned her eyes to look at another figure beside her sporting hair of similar color and the palest of skin as though she were a sculpture made of marble. She was what one might call a mystical beauty one who enticed anyone in her vicinity. It wasnt just her appearance either. She had the ability to draw people close to her using the right words and her seemingly heavenly voice that echoed from her lips deep into their hearts. Truly this was no ordinary person but someone who could be considered an angel or a demon posing as one. Are you okay Sayukichan she asked. YYes Im fine Neesan. the girl who was called Sayuki blatantly lied. Hmm you dont look like it. the older sister shot back. Her eyes having the power to peer into her very soul she spoke knowing exactly what her trouble was You seem to have had some fun experiences in that world and now those were taken away tragically. You know about that world Sayuki asked in shock. But of course. After all I was invited to join a similar game. With an XSB cable in her hand the older sister said How about it Do you want to go back there Hmm Suddenly her inner consciousness was telling her not to go for she felt a sad foreboding. Nevertheless she wrestled with her thoughts for two minutes before deciding to take the cable and deciding to find out what that world she experienced was about. Alright Ill do it. With that Sayuki received the mysterious application that would change her life for the years to come Brain Burst 2039.,Teen And Up Audiences,Cross-Posted on FanFiction.NetFriendship/LoveRomance
https://archiveofourown.org/works/41817792,Miraculous Acceleration,She grasped at her mother begging her not to go. The woman sneered down at her like a bug before kicking her away her small fragile body rolling across the ground. Her classmates stared down at her as if she were nothing turning away from her as inky darkness swirled around her. She ripped and pulled desperate to get free of the darkness reaching out. She wanted someone anyone to help her to pull her free. They saw her she could see them spot her crawling in the shadows ugly and stained only to turn away in disgust. Why Why didnt they help her Couldnt they see See me. The blackness swallowed her face choking her as the scorn turned to apathy. No they didnt hate her. That would require caring. She she was nothing to them. Less than nothing. Why should they care Please I just want someone to see The sun rose across the horizon brilliant. All those who had ignored her stopped staring at it in awe. As if life suddenly had meaning. Yet the light of the sun did not cut through her darkness. All I ever wanted was for someone to see me. To shine I just wanted someone to see me shine Is that your wish Chloe Bourgeois was unhappy. How laughable right She was rich the daughter of the Mayor of Paris and the Queen of Style people had been lining up to kiss up to her for YEARS desperate to mooch off of someone as connected as she at least until she opened her mouth that is. For some reason she never saw the same hangerons twice a day going through them like wood in a woodchipper. Pfft whatever it wasnt her problem if they couldnt keep up. Where was she Ah right Unhappy. How laughable. Who could suspect she the one and only Chloe Bourgeois of being unhappy Whatever she wanted Daddy made sure she got whenever she wanted it. If people were too stupid to realize what a catch she was that wasnt HER problem. Mother always said that people like them could never walk in the same world as people like her and everyone was better off for it and Mother was never wrong. Shoulders back chin up eyes narrowed. Repeating her personal motto she flipped open her mirror inspecting her makeup every potential flaw hidden every strength accentuated. Perfect obviously. She was a knockout Why would she be unhappy As the neurolinker fixed to the back of her neck beeped she resisted the urge to scoff as a message from Sabrina came through letting her know she was down stairs. Of course she was down stairs where else would she be She was all Sabrina had. Smirking to herself at the knowledge that at least SOMEONE recognized greatness when they saw it she made her way down the two of them leaving the hotel she called home it was her fathers a symbol of his status and power. After a short talk on the drive over trading the latest gossip as Sabrina filled out the last of her homework Chloes work slid over without question. Away from prying eyes Chloe let her guard down beaming in joy at the completed assignment legs kicking up as she squealed. She HATED Science and Mrs. Mendeleiev always gave out a lot. She ignored Sabrinas proud blush she had done her job as it was expected of her. Chloe made a note to pick out a hat that matched Sabrinas geek chic outfit and bright orange hair. As they walked up to the school Chloe having dropped her bags into Sabrinas arms upon exiting the vehicle Chloes eyes traced a figure rushing up the stairs clothing crooked and bag near spilling from how severely overstuffed it was as the poor girl carrying it tripped at the last second just BARELY avoiding a nasty tumble as a girl with darker skin and an inquisitive smirk easily caught her. DupainCheng. UGH why did such an eyesore have to go to the same school as her As she and Sabrina neared she considered commenting on her clumsiness and decided against it. She didnt have time for DupainChengs stunts not after last night. She was SO glad she had practiced her makeup as much as she had this way nobody could see the ugly ugly rings under her eyes. The day someone caught her in public looking like Hell warmed over would be the day she died and not a second before As she slid into her seat exchanging a quick glare with DupainChengs little minion Cesaire and a smile with Adrien she began the daily process of tuning out the mediocre trash surrounding her in favor of focusing on her lessons. As the relevant information was broadcast across her vision via the neurolinker she caught sight of Sabrina taking notes beside her. How dutiful Just another day being Chloe Bourgeois. Lunch Time. One of the few moments where she could avoid the rabble without hassle. Well aside from a brief confrontation with Cesaire who was currently being held back by Kubdel and DupainCheng. She laughed if one little comment on her hygiene was enough to get her to react like that she was better off washing dishes somewhere then being a reporter Besides its not her fault the girl smelled like she hadnt showered. My arent you the spiteful one As the message flashed across her vision Chloe froze glancing around briefly. Sabrina was currently talking to Haprele and she was the only one besides Adrien who had her personal neurolink information to SEND her a message in the first place not counting her schoolsupplied information for garbage like assemblies and group activities. Did they think the students were still FIVE or something Shaking it off she refocused on the message lips pursed in irritation at the lack of a return address. THAT was a warning sign if shed ever seen one. Hmm I honestly expected you to react by this point. Disappointing. Okay thats it risk or no risk she was getting to the bottom of this. With the speed and focus of longpractice and a natural talent not that it got her anything she mentally composed and sent the message in a flash CBOkay who the hell are you and how did you get my information Because I SWEAR if this is some kind of stunt to blackmail me my Daddy has some of the best lawyers and computer specialists in France ready and willing to tear you apart for all youve got. My my quite the feisty one. I knew I had made the correct choice Be not afraid Ms. Bourgeois this is nothing so gauche as blackmail of all things. No this is an opportunity. Her eyes narrowed. Yeah she called bullshit on that. She may not get the best grades in school Sabrinas help with her homework notwithstanding but you didnt grow up swimming with Piranhas and Sharks without learning to smell blood in the water. CBYeah And what would you say if I said I wasnt interested Please do not insult us. One such as yourself who so desperately desires to become more than merely another spectacle for people to gawk at would do well to accept our proposition Ms. Bourgeois. CB...Suppose for a second I bought any of this. You still havent explained what you are offering me yet. Haha Clever. My associates and I have quite the simple offer for you. We wish for you to test a product of ours. One which has the potential to revolutionize society if it manages to pass muster. You would be one of a small pittance of the population of France entrusted with the chance to get in on the ground floor to see for yourself Chloe froze the reply cursor blinking before her eyes. While this smelled SO MUCH of bullshit the pitch was hitting all her buttons. It was obvious why they had chosen her someone as wellconnected and as influential as she was a sure choice for pushing the validity of whatever this mysterious product actually was. It was still sketchy as hell but the chance for glory was too tempting. Not letting herself to hesitate she fired back her reply. CBWhat would I have to do Simple. Merely say Accelerate. Accelerate She echoed almost in reflex. Her eyes widened she hadnt meant to do that. A feeling not unlike a punch to the gut THANKS for allowing her to know what that felt like Cesaire rippled through her her body doubling over for a second. And then she fell. The ground shattered before her eyes her body hurtling downward skin and clothing peeling away from her body to reveal a crystalclear shell. A scream tore itself from her throat unable to contain her panic as the wind ripped past her her oddly crystalline body becoming coated in vibrant gold. Loading Beginning Entry Welcome Back Gold Brilliant Arriving at Acceleration Zone The Canopy She didnt remember hitting the ground. She also didnt remember standing. Yet here she was standing in the middle of some Jungle or whatever. The plants looked weird. She didnt recognize them from any source shed seen and she was pretty damn sure that Palm Trees werent supposed to have Pine Needles. Stepping forward she nearly stumbled a rush of exhaustion rippling through her. Ugh What What hit me She groaned exhaustion and annoyance warring within her mind. Fighting a slowly building headache she raised a hand to rub against her temple and froze. Shaking lightly she slowly turned the hand the SOLID GOLD HAND ATTACHED TO HER EQUALLY GOLD WRIST before her eyes. WWhat What is this Staring down she stared in shock at the sight of her body or SOMEONES body clad in a golden shell modeled after one of those weirdo Japanese Heroes Dont look at her its not like she likes them or anything. Was this someones idea of a joke A small cursor blinked in the corner of her eye. Focusing on it a timer pulled down at 2942 and counting down. She was stuck WHEREVER this place was for half an hour Ugh she knew agreeing to this was a mistake. WELCOME APPLICANTS Stumbling Chloes gaze shot upwards shocked at the incredibly loud voice that shook the very ground. Blinking she fought the urge to blush at the absolutely GIANT image of the impossibly beautiful woman floating in the air the presumed source. Cupping her hands to her face she wondered if she had a mouth like this she shouted up at the figure. Hey Whats going on here lady YOU HAVE ALL BEEN SELECTED TO TAKE PART IN THE TEST TRIAL FOR THE ACCELERATION SYSTEM The woman continued oblivious to Chloes shouting. She had a feeling that would happen but it was still embarrassing. The woman gave a pleasant smile. DURING THIS TRIAL YOU WILL ALL FIGHT BATTLE AND EXPLORE WITHIN THE ACCELERATION ZONE OR AZONE FOR SHORT A FULLY IMMERSIVE GAME IN OTHER WORDS WITH THE POWER OF ACCELERATION THE 30 SUBJECTIVE MINUTES YOU EXPERIENCE WILL BE LESS THAN 2 REAL TIME SECONDS. WITH THE DATA GAINED BY YOUR ACTIONS WE WILL SEE IF ACCELERATION IS READY FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO ENJOY AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HAVE FUN REMEMBER ACCELERATION IS A COMPANY SECRET AND BY ENTERING YOU HAVE GIVEN YOUR ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE AGREEING TO KEEP THE EXISTENCE OF ACCELERATION A CONFIDENTIAL SECRET FROM ALL THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW OF IT. BUT ENOUGH OF THAT BORING STUFF. THIS IS YOUR WORLD NOW GO OUT AND HAVE FUN And with that the womans image vanished. Sighing Chloes shoulders slumped. She had agreed to be part of a fricking Video Game. Lame. But whether she meant to or not she had given her word and was bound to it even if she did think that agreement thing was sketchy as hell and would in no way hold up in court. Might as well enjoy this while it lasts. She had thirty minutes to kill after all and after that she could put this stupid thing behind her. What a waste of her time. And only taking 2 seconds Please if something THAT big was out there obviously someone wouldve let the secret out by now. Heres hoping none of those losers at school doodled on her face while she was doubled over and drooling. As she walked through the woods she shoved the various plants out of her path grumbling all the while. What she wouldnt give for a weed wacker or something ANYTHING to get rid of this crap. Slowly a faint growl built up in the air. Uh oh. Her steps slowing the growls grew louder and louder until she was completely surrounded. Glancing around she resisted the urge to gulp at the sight of the eerily realistic wolves surrounding her. Uhh Nice doggies She managed just before the lead wolf a hulking thing whose fur split open to reveal bloodred blades and burning eyes lunged at her howling Forgetting that this was a game she screamed lashing out with a punch. As soon as her clumsy blow connected the beast went flying and her hand screamed in protest. Grasping her wrist she took advantage of the beast being stunned its pack unsure what to do at the sight of their leader unmoving. Turning she ran as hard as she could. SOMEBODY HELP As she ran the Blood Wolf pulled itself to its feet snarling at its pack before leaping after its prey.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/40837218,Sword Art Online: Dimensional Merge,It was a rather calm day in Ainground. After having dealt with the prior events of Genesis trying to seemingly destroy Ainground and create the world of Aincrad in Sword Art Origins. Kirito and his group were finally able to relax even having finally befriended Tia after her end of things. They all sat around at one of the restaurants in game discussing what they would be doing next. One member of the group wasnt there it seemed a friend they found during Aincrad whom was a member of Laughing Coffin Delilah. Kirito...where is Delilah at Wasnt she gonna met us here Asuna asked her loving boyfriend Kirito looked at her showing some concern at least She said she would meet us here I guess maybe she got caught up in something perhaps. It was then that Silica eventually spoke up Uhm I think she said she was just gonna spend some time grinding for more materials and then she would be here later... Pina let out a little chirp in agreement with Silica. Klein however only hoped that Delilah wasnt with her current boyfriend. Since Aincrad Delilah was in a relationship with Laughing Coffins second in command RedEyed XaXa supposedly they had a rather good relationship but he barely gave her much attention even after getting out of Aincrad he didnt seem to pay much attention to her so it left Delilah feeling rather distraught and knew that her relationship was falling apart but she still loved him also knowing his little brother had quite the obsession with Sinon so to speak. Liz would look at Klein giving him a look and saying Youre not upset still about the fact that Delilah is still in a relationship right She questioned. Klein snapped out of his thoughts stuttering a bit before uttering out Nno Not at all I am sure she is very much happy with her relationship JJust...she doesnt seem happy and I wish I could just try to make her happy.... He groaned it was clear that Klein did have slight feelings for Delilah and Delilah was at least close to being his age at least. While the group continued to wait for Delilah Delilah was out killing a few more monsters before finally meeting up with the group.Out in the field of Rustoria Plains Delilah was out killing a few Boars and Crabs to pass time having not realized she should be meeting up with the rest of the group back in Town. Delilah has done a bit of solo playing herself after the training she was given back in Aincrad from members of Laughing Coffin specifically her current boyfriend. Delilah primarily used a Spear as her current weapon having worked extremely hard with the new content that was added into the game she got a hold of the Lumina Spear one of the Paragon Weapons along with one of the Paragon Armors she could choose from which all were literally the exact same but had different stats to them. She would sometimes get eyes from other players due to how.....revealing the armor was down around her crotch area primarily she would usually ignore these players who would try to flirt with her or straight up start a duel with them to get them to back off. But as she was done with killing time and was about to head to a teleport stone to get back to town suddenly she heard a loud boom like thunder. Lightening went across the sky maybe it was starting to rain in the world But no...instead the sky grew a little dark and a portal right next to her had opened the force from the portal was so strong that it began to suck her in as she tried to make a run for it. Once sucked in she tried calling out for help even calling out to Kirito before the portal eventually closed on her sending her to another world.Kirito and his group heard the loud booming sounds seeing the sky grow dark like it was going to rain. As the group looked around portals began opening around town even out in the fields too. Unknown creatures came flying out of portals. One creature being a sort of gargoyle looking creature it seemed to sort of have a theme of being fire based with reds and orange on its body. Another creature being a somewhat humanoid looking falcon this one having some kind of theme to being wind based as it was mainly a variety of greens all over its body. Many of these creatures came flying out of these portals and began attacking the Town and anything it saw. Is this some kind of event happening What is going on Kirito yelled before he could attempt to get his answer by contacting Seven one of the creatures spotted him it was the gargoyle like creature which flew in to attack him. Kirito would ready himself to fight back against the monster. Ive never seen monsters like these before these are different from what we normally see in SAO All around other players were getting attacked some were even attempting to fight back the best they could. It was then that Kirito was being contacted by Seven once he managed to stun the Gargoyle like creature he made a run for it alongside his friends who headed directly for the Inn on Market Street. Once inside his room with everyone else he was able to answer to Seven Seven what is going on Is this some kind of new event we didnt know about He demanded Seven would then answer back stating No This is nothing we planned whatsoever it seems to be some kind of disturbance or dimensional disruption like back in ALO when it was being merged with that of the Accelerated World Kirito remembered that day that exact day when Yui was taken hostage by her future self without the help of Haruyuki and his friends they wouldnt have gotten Yui back. So we are experiencing another world merge again Kirito asked Yes but we are unsure if its possible that this world is....a virtual one portals are opening everywhere and something about these creatures is off they are unlike anything we have seen and they seem to have some kind of theme around them like the colors match as to what element they use or something like that. Kirito could clearly see what she meant the gargoyle creature that attacked him was that of a fire based enemy Kirito thought about it perhaps they should actually try to attempt and investigate this new world that has merged with their own to try and hopefully stop what is happening.After the talk with Seven Kirito and his group sat around in the Inn Room trying to figure out as to what they needed to do. Kirito thought of perhaps making way into one of the portals with his friends to see what this other world is that these creatures come from. Aside from the fact that the creatures were elemental based the energy they gave off was something they had never felt before like something completely different. No mob or Raid Boss looked anything like the creatures that were invading Ainground. At that point it was now decided I say we see what this other world is we need to find one of these portals and make our way to one of the portals to see what this world is that these creatures come from maybe then we will find the source in stopping them from invading perhaps. Asuna then spoke to Kirito Are you sure that is a good idea Kirito What if this world is nothing like the virtual world we are in what if its something completely different Seven did say she couldnt clarify if the world these monsters come from is virtual or not. Kirito looked at her agreeing youre right but we wont know until we actually visit that world and see what the cause is in order to stop this invasion from happening we have to go to the source which is the world these creatures come from even if the world is not virtual its a risk we have to take to stop all this from happening. Asuna looked at Kirito while he may be a big doof he was right this time it didnt seem like he wanted to do it alone...in fact Kirito did need the help of his friends to resolve this issue. Asuna nods in agreement with Kirito Youre right Kirito we should stop this issue together. Kirito looked over at his loving girlfriend nodding back at her with a smile. Alright then lets go find a portal we can jump into to hopefully get this issue resolved Kirito shouted with everyone else in the group shouting in agreement before they began to head out to find a portal to jump into to be able to travel to this unknown new world in which these elemental creatures came from.,Mature,Minor Sexual ContentStrong LanguageImplied/Referenced Child AbuseMinor RomanceEmotional ManipulationMinor OCxCanonImplied/Referenced Rape/Non-con
https://archiveofourown.org/works/43212090,Dragon At My Door,It was a nice day out relatively peaceful in the trailer park I called home. My cat and I had just spent our morning half hour outside the cat roaming about his mesh tent and tunnel setup me reclining in my chaise lounge. The cat was now back inside enjoying his promised treats. I however had chosen to go back outside to enjoy the cool midday weather. It had been a depressing year the entire world dealing with the effects of the Covid19 pandemic. Many things we had taken for granted now had to be put on hold the pleasures we had once enjoyed pushed to the back burners of life as we all struggled to survive. I am a neophyte author writing stories of fantasy and science fiction. I hadnt found a favorite author until I first read Anne McCaffreys Dragonriders Of Pern. From that moment I had frequently fantasized about what such a world would be like what it must be like to Impress one of those wonders of biogenetic engineering a Pern dragon. Id even written a fan fiction story centering around a character who went to Pern and Impressed a queen dragon. Tears fell from my eyes as I thought back over that story. How I wished it couldve been true that Pern was real that I had Impressed the dragon I had imagined. God Tarnaa I sobbed feeling tears well up in my eyes how I wish you were here Sadly in this reality dragons only existed in mythology movies or books. But that didnt stop me from wishing I have a flagpole outside my place a flag flying proudly from its top. A decent breeze was blowing occasionally causing the flapping flag to make noise as it snapped about in the breeze. I mustve dozed off sitting there when a strange flapping noise intruded on my sleep. Thinking it was just the flag on the pole I opened my eyes to take a look and was greeted by the opalescent stare of an enormous multifaceted eye Holy shit I exclaimed tumbling frantically out of the chaise lounge before scrambling up the steps my back to the wall as I stared in complete disbelief at the impossible an enormous golden dragon Are you alright I gasped my hands snapping up to cover my ears. Id heard that question in my mind Are you alright my golden visitor once more inquired. Mutely slowly lowering my hands I nodded. Oh good she sighed settling her wings to her back. I was a little worried. Who who are you I whispered somehow mustering the courage to take a step closer. The dragon didnt answer but it looked like she was smiling. No this is impossible I gasped sudden realization nearly causing my knees to give way. My heart racing my hands trembling I whispered Tarnaa Her eyes brilliant amethyst jewels of love and adoration the dragon nodded. How can this be I wept tears falling like rain as I slowly stepped up to her placing my trembling hands on the side of her massive golden head. How can you possibly be here You called. I came. I wept. God how I wept as I leaned oh so tenderly against her neck her dragon scent filling my nostrils. At the same time my mind my reason was in utter turmoil. This was impossible Wasnt it I must be dreaming I whimpered my knees trembling with the force of my emotions. Uncertainty stabbed a spear through my heart. What if thats all this was What if I really was dreaming No my heart Tarnaa calmly reassured me rubbing her muzzle against my tearsoaked cheek. Its not a dream. But how can you be here I sobbed peering up into her thoroughly loving eyes. You know the answer my heart. For a moment I hesitated and then gasped eyes flying wide hands snapping up to cover my lips. Quantum ergokinesis I hissed my eyes Im sure looking like they were going to pop from my head. Just like in my stories Rumbling contentedly Tarnaa nodded. The ability to move between dimensions to explore alternate realities Id only used it as an idea in a story I wrote. But now impossibly I was confronted with irrefutable proof that the concept was much more than simple theory Still how could my cry have possibly reached across who knew how many dimensional barriers to reach the soul of my heart At the moment none of that mattered. I just stood there leaning against Tarnaas warm and welcoming head quietly weeping. She in turn quietly thrummed filling my heart to overflowing with joy. Oh my heart I sobbed clutching her tightly. Youve no idea how often I have prayed for something like this to happen. And now it has she replied gently embracing me with one of her wings. From the first day of my hatching I knew beyond certainty that one day I would find you. And now you have I sighed meeting her loving amethyst gaze. Thanks to you. How long has it been since you hatched Several Turns now. Wait what You didnt Impress in all that time Why Surely there was someone who I didnt because I could sense you were out there somewhere my heart and I knew you were the only one who could make me truly complete I collapsed to my knees leaning against her warm golden head tears pouring down my face sobs rising from the depths of my soul. Barely able to utter a whisper I told her I pray one day I prove worthy of you noble Tarnaa. Meeting her amethyst gaze once more I surrendered to the power of Impression giving myself fully and totally to my dragon lifemate In that moment we two became one Oh my heart I wept my arms wrapped gently around her muzzle Im so sorry you had to wait so long. I wish I had known. All that matters lifemate is that we two are finally united. Somewhere nearby I heard a door open. Seconds later the air was split with heartrending screams One of my neighbors had come out of their trailer park home spotted Tarnaa and freaked out That scream brought others out some gasping a few more joining their screams to the first. Why are they acting like that Tarnaa wondered glancing about at all the chaos. I wish I knew my heart I sighed rising to my feet. Turning to the crowd I told them Dont be afraid. She wont hurt you. Please come say hello Unfortunately no one took me up on the offer. Fear and loathing were all I could see on their faces which only confused me further. These people were my neighbors and friends Tarnaa what are we going to do I muttered despair welling up inside me. I dont think itll be safe for you to stay here Then come with me she suggested nudging my shoulder with her muzzle. What I gasped whirling to face her. Come with me she repeated. In my reality humans and dragons work together and I want to introduce you to my family and friends to show them the one I have been waiting so long for Please What should I do I felt like I was being torn in half. Id just been united with my dragon lifemate the ultimate fulfillment of an incredible dream but it was also clear Tarnaa couldnt stay here. On the flip side how could I go with her If I did it would mean leaving behind everything I knew everything I owned my home my parents and my cat Lifemate Sobbing I leaned against Tarnaas neck rivers of tears running down my face. In the end I realized there really was no choice. My cry had brought her here setting in motion everything that was happening. If I stayed Tarnaa would die. I couldnt let that happen. In that moment I realized just how my story character must have felt Oh my heart I whispered fresh tears coming to my eyes I truly do not deserve you Smiling as I patted the side of her head I told her Give me a moment. Ill be right back I raced back into my home grabbing my computers wireless keyboard. Gotta go Dad I typed into a quick email tears falling as I did. Please dont worry. Ill be fine. Try and find someone in the park who can take you to the hockey games. Take care of Mom. Find a good home for Opi for me Love ya As I hit the send button I felt a pang of regret. Dad depended on me to push the wheelchair he used going to the hockey games but I just couldnt stay. He was always watching the news so I was reasonably certain he would eventually figure it all out. I slipped my purse with my cell phone and keys cross body by the strap over my head and under one arm. Opi my cat was resting on the back of the couch idly watching my activity. There was plenty of food in his dishes and his litter was still fresh. Giving his ears a quick scratch I added a silent prayer that someone would look after him in my absence. Then I quickly packed my laptop and charger into my backpack slinging the pack over my shoulders. Grabbing my sunglasses and putting them on I headed back out to my dragon locking the door as I went. NO Someone in the crowd had brought out a shotgun and was aiming it at Tarnaa But before I could react the weapon leaped out of the persons hands. As it gently floated above the terrified crowd I watched in fascination as the barrel of the weapon was bent and twisted before being dropped unceremoniously to the asphalt road everyone was standing on. TK I silently wondered. Emitting a chuckling rumble Tarnaa nodded. What the hell is the matter with you people I roared glaring around at the crowd of spectators as they slowly backed away. Gesturing at Tarnaa I told them This is my friend Your friend one of the residents gasped fear in her eyes. Its a monster the one who had tried to use the shotgun protested picking up his now useless weapon. Thats right another of the residents chimed in ducking as I searched for the speaker. I couldnt believe what I was hearing Granted most stories about dragons at least in this reality depicted them in a bad light but still The only ones I see here acting like monsters is you lot I growled sweeping my hand in a wide arc. Shes done absolutely nothing to any of you and this is how you treat her Stars above if this was what the world was coming to then I definitely wanted no part of it. Tears coming to my eyes I turned and ran to Tarnaa springing up to her proffered foreleg reaching up to seize her neck ridge and swinging myself into position as she lifted me up. Glancing down at the crowd of people I used to think were my friends I hissed Lets go lifemate. This reality doesnt deserve dragons. I felt the musculature of her back shift beneath my legs just before Tarnaa leapt skyward her down sweep easily clearing the ground. Higher and higher we spiraled into the midday sky each stroke of Tarnaas wings filling me with pride in my lifemate. Here we go she warned me. It will be cold and dark but I will still be with you. With one final downstroke of her wings the two of us vanished from the skies of Earth.,General Audiences,Crossovers & Fandom Fusions
https://archiveofourown.org/works/42494634,The Birthday Present,Chapter 1 The Discovery Altair VI a decent enough world to live on. Scientifically and technologically advanced as a member world of the Federated Sentient Planets they still managed to import some rather quaint artifacts from Earth. Like the restaurant Akadeanna Kestrel was now sitting in enjoying lunch and a respite from her university studies into ancient societies. Its name was just as quaint as the establishment Applebees Akadeanna had done her research on the place. First established back on Earth in the year 1980 in the city of Atlanta Georgia it had managed to survive through good times and bad like the COVID19 pandemic of the early 21st century. It had managed to survive exportation across the stars to the worlds humans now called home and was beginning to make inroads on some nonTerran worlds. Akadeanna had to admit. The food here was pretty good She was perusing some intel about the latest Talent tower that was going up on Iota Aurigae when a rather large shadow fell across her table. Looking up she spotted four Space Marines grinning at her. The look they gave her made her skin crawl except for that cute one standing discreetly in the rear. Sighing she set her fork down. So much for lunch Can I help you she inquired dabbing some barbeque sauce from her lips. Youre that Perny right the lead Marine asked. The what Youve been to Pern he snorted his personal estimates of Akadeanna dropping a couple of notches. I have she admitted taking a sip of her soda. So The dragons the second one jumped in fidgeting in his excitement. What about them Akadeanna was becoming annoyed with this one. Maybe it was the pathing energy he was radiating scattershot and totally uncontrolled. Akadeanna turned up her personal shields to compensate. You can actually ride them the third exclaimed his own excitement growing. If they allow it Akadeanna admitted. Why Whats any of this have to do with a bunch of Space Marines Glancing at the silent one in the rear she asked Nothing from you Your companions seem pretty excited about the Pern dragons. Theyve heard a lot of rumors about the place he remarked squarely meeting her gaze. There was a recent incident out in that region and the FSP is sending an expeditionary force to secure the area and make certain no further dangers exist. I see Akadeanna remarked. She remembered that incident well. Akadeanna had had to call in a lot of favors to get a travel permit to go to Pern following that Khleevi attack. If it hadnt been for their Prime and their dragons the rest of the systems making up the FSP wouldve been caught up in a war even worse than the Nathi conflict. In her mind it made sense what the FSP was doing but it rankled that some of these military types could only think of the dragons. They just didnt understand. Have you ridden them the quiet one asked. Intelligent not overbearing Akadeanna liked this one. Smiling she nodded. Whats it like the first one asked nearly drooling with excitement. Very personal she sighed recalling her first flight and very exhilarating. Glancing up Akadeanna saw a couple of fighter craft zooming by. Pointing at them she said Like strapping into one of those only not having any of the vessels protective skin around you. Completely exposed. You have to be strapped into the dragons harness or youd go flying the moment one of them takes off. Meeting their gazes she added And the jump between At least eight seconds of total sensory deprivation and bonechilling cold. Most first timers never get over the terror. That statement caused several of the Marines to gulp looking about nervously. The lead one merely snorted. You lyin girl he growled looking like he was ready to punch her lights out. Maybe Akadeanna shrugged taking a long sip of her soda. Then again Gunny the third Marine asked his voice betraying his fear. Glaring at Akadeanna the Marine Gunnery Sergeant merely huffed before hurrying off the other two following. That the fourth one remained behind annoyed her a little. What do you want To say thank you he replied bowing slightly to her for not pounding those three with your TK. Akadeanna gasped. How did you Grinning at her surprise he said Corporal Vance Benden 85th Space Marines Brigade. Winking he added Im also a T6 telepath and T4 telekinetic. Giving Akadeanna an appraising look he added Ive a feeling youre higher than that especially if youve flown on Pern dragons. I might be she offhandedly commented. She could feel him probing her shields but he didnt press it. Look Ive gotta run he told her glancing at his watch. Do you eat here often About once a week Akadeanna admitted. I get tired of my own cooking at times. Yeah I know the feeling he grimaced recalling some of his own failures. The girl giggled briefly. Either she was a damned good telepath reacting to his memories of his past culinary failures or she was just commiserating with a fellow disaster of a chef. Will I see you again You know something corporal Akadeanna surprised herself by saying I think Id like that Great Corporal Benden sighed smiling. Catch ya later then Akadeanna watched as he hurried off waving to her as he disappeared around a corner. Well that was interesting she sighed to herself resuming her interrupted lunch. The meetings became more frequent Corporal Benden seeking Akadeanna out whenever he could. He was pleasant to be around and she found it easy to talk to him even about her doctoral work on ancient civilizations. One weekend when the two of them were free they put together a picnic lunch and took a ground skimmer up into the nearby Altairian hills to relax talk and get to know each other better. Vance was intrigued with her studies of Pern how colonists from such an advanced civilization as the FSP had quickly devolved into a rather strict feudal system of government. He was especially disturbed to learn that his ancestor Admiral Paul Benden had been one of the leaders of the budding colony. But Vance dont you see Akadeanna tried to explain to him. Thats the whole point They were trying to get away from technology to develop a society that was more agrarian than they were accustomed to. Given the hardships of Threadfall it follows that they would be more concerned with their survival than expending energy and resources to maintain their technology. They didnt want or need it Thats why they had come to Pern in the first place to get away from technology. It was only when the descendants of the original colonists had finally grown weary of Threadfall that they turned to the knowledge their progenitors had left behind in AIVAS and used that newfound knowledge to bring about an end to Thread By using the explosive capabilities of the colony ships power cores to blast the planetoid Vance finished for her diverting it away from the trajectory that would take it through the Oort Cloud preventing the planetoid from dragging any more Thread spores into the path of Pern and eventually sending the planetoid spiraling into Rukbat forever removing the vector that brought Thread to their world in the first place. Yes Akadeanna sighed smiling at his understanding. I cant even begin to imagine how difficult it was for them to relearn all that science and technology Vance muttered shaking his head in disbelief much less how they figured out how to use it to solve their problem with Thread Its stunning Turning to Akadeanna he added Thats going to make one hell of a doctors thesis Akie Akie his pet name for her. In spite of herself Akadeanna smiled. Did you get to ride the dragons a lot during your stay planetside Akadeanna shook her head. Between dodging Threadfall and speaking with all the different representatives of hold hall and weyr I had very little free time. Before I knew it my visa had run out and I was forced to return home. Do you miss it A little. I get back there from time to time. Since that Khleevi incident the FSP has been staying in close contact with Pern helping them to reintroduce the technology their ancestors could only dream about. Looking up Vance uttered a dark expletive. Leaping to his feet he dusted off his uniform glancing frantically about. Hed been so intrigued by their discussions that the sun had actually set Bloody hell Ive stayed away too long If I dont get back to base and quick theyll report me as AWOL Then wed better get you back to your base Akadeanna told him looking up into his kindly smiling face. At her words something massive moved out of the nearby shadows enormous opalescent eyes that twirled and regarded him with intense scrutiny. Vance stumbled backwards gasping as the creature stepped out into the light. A dragon he hissed absolutely bugeyed to be seeing an actual Pern queen. How Where And then he remembered what she had told him. Your doctoral studies on Pern You were there for a Hatching Smiling as she stepped up to her lifemate Akadeanna nodded. I didnt want to frighten you. We didnt want to frighten you Akadeannas dragon silently added glancing first at her rider then at him. Vance slapped his hands over his ears his eyes threatening to pop from their sockets. I heard her By the stars above I heard her Well of course you did silly Akadeanna chuckled clapping him on the back. Didnt you tell me you were a T6 telepath Given that metric Idve been surprised if you didnt Its nice to finally meet you Vance Akadeannas queen said to him. I am Vornath. A rider Vance whispered staring in awe at Akadeannas queen and then at her. Youre a dragonrider And if we dont hurry she admonished him tossing a riding belt to him from her dragons saddlebags youre gonna get in trouble Vance made fast work of putting on the riding belt. He was a little nervous about following Akadeanna up to sit astride the immense dragon that was her lifemate. She made sure he was firmly belted in before giving her dragon the signal to take off. Vance leaned into the leap absorbing the launch almost as well as an experienced rider. I have the fix Vornath rumbled. Then get us there my heart Akadeanna implored her dragon. In the blink of an eye the threesome vanished from the skies of Altair VI. Seconds later they appeared above the courtyard just outside the barracks where Corporal Benden was staying. Akadeanna and her dragon had just taken wing and vanished between when a shout just behind him nearly gave Vance a heart attack Benden where the bloody blue hell have you been Gunny Sergeant Dorslin roared snarling at the wayward corporal. Sorry Gunny wont happen again Vance responded snapping to attention. Gunny Dorslin looked like he was about to say something further but then just huffed to himself and stormed off out of sight. Thanks Vornath Vance quietly sent smiling up at the brilliant moon above. And please pass on my appreciation to your rider Will do Akadeannas queen replied. Well see you again I hope so Vance sighed heading into his barracks for some wellearned sleep. Many possibilities lay ahead. Corporal Vance Benden was determined to give it his best. Now if he could just Impress a dragon,General Audiences,Crossover

https://archiveofourown.org/works/10899000,Horns and Tails,Son Goku had just gathered himself an armful of tasty pears for breakfast when he heard a loud crash. It sounded like it was coming from the edge of the forest. He dropped all but one of the pears which he crammed in his mouth as he ran to see what had made the noise. There was a crater next to Grandpas house. In the middle of it was a pod. Goku leaned over the craters edge his tail extended for balance. He took another bite of the pear. The pod door opened and a boy stepped out. He looked a fair bit older than Goku maybe in his early teens. He was wearing really weird clothes but then Goku hadnt really seen anybody else except himself and Grandpa that he could remember so maybe they were fashionable in the big cities or something. He sure had really long hair. It came down to his tail. The older boy spotted him and said something in a language Goku couldnt understand but something about it seemed vaguely familiar. Im sorry but I cant understand you Goku said hopping down. Arguably it was hard to understand him since he was still chewing on his last mouthful of pear but he felt like he had to say something. Grandpa always said it was rude to ignore people. The older boy sighed. He pushed some buttons on the strange device he wore over his left eye and ear muttering in that strange language. Watcha got on yer eye Goku asked. Its kinda pretty when it lights up. Raditz couldnt believe his ill luck. Not only had Kakarot apparently failed to complete his mission after 7 years he also didnt seem to recognize his older brother or even speak Saiyan. Somethings wrong he said into his scouter. Kakarot looks healthy but...he isnt acting anything like a Saiyan and he hasnt fulfilled his mission. Raditzs little brother was even more of a stranger to him than hed expected. His prince scoffed Youre the one who wanted to pick him up. Deal with it. Were leaving the system in an hour with or without you. Raditz scowled at having to take orders from a prince who was younger than he was. Goku decided to try again. He tried to remember what Grandpa had said he should do if he saw a stranger...Introduce himself Right Heya My names Son Goku Whats yours Ten Years Later In hindsight the planet of wriggling slimy plants hadnt been the best place to land and make camp. There were no animals or fruits around to eat no fish to catch and the damned vines had kept grabbing at their legs and tails whenever the four Saiyans tried to explore the place. Nappas attempt to relieve himself had not gone well. Theyd headed back into space before nightfall tired hungry and in Nappas case sore and bruised all over. Well suggested Kakarot maybe the next planet will have something we can use. Or at least a lead on that threat Lord Frieza wanted us to investigate. The youngest member of the squad Kakarot was always an optimist. Vegeta sighed. Frieza had sent them out a month ago on a mission to find out if the rumors about a potential threat to his empire were true. Apparently there was some sort of creature out there that was both fairly strong and had the numbers to be dangerous. But so far there were no signs of intelligent life anywhere let alone any powerful spacefaring races. After the disaster this planet had turned out to be Vegeta decided hed have Kakarot reconnoiter next time before the rest of them landed. As the weakest of the group he was expendable. Raditz would complain but Raditz complained about damn near everything. In his pod the Saiyan who still occasionally thought of himself as Son Goku sighed. Hed gone along with his brother and their people 10 years ago because hed hoped for adventure to see new things to be around someone other than himself and the memories of his adoptive grandfather. It seemed though that he spent half the time cooped up in a space pod off to clear yet another planet for Frieza. He hadnt even gotten to fight with anybody really strong in the last three years. Sure there was that time Prince Vegeta got drunk but nobodys as good a fighter drunk as they are sober. Kakarot was itching for a fight. Maybe there would be strong guys to fight on the next planet.,Teen And Up Audiences,Not Found
https://archiveofourown.org/works/3970141,Of Love and Lies,She knew him everyone knew him Elder the future leader of the ship so when she saw him running from the Hospital one night after the solar lamp clicked off she thought it was a little strange. Typically when she saw him he was dignified mature even if he was ten years younger. Here everyone was the same age if were part of the Generation you were 25 but Elder being born between the seasons so he could be trained to be leader was 17 and Eldest the current leader was 37. It was simple this way she had thought unlike what shed seen in vids of Sol Earth people were never the same age there and she thought that would be quite confusing. Elodie never really questioned much she enjoyed simple things waking up with the light of the solar lamp in the morning spending her days among the books from previous gens and some that were left over from Sol Earth walking around the garden outside and sometimes sticking her feet in the water of the lake and finally ending the days looking out over the quite ship until the solar lamp clicked off for the night shrouding the ship in darkness except for a dull glow from the lamp which was supposed to mimic Sol Earths moons light and the distant lights from the City that lay across the fields. She knew she was different from the people in the city she grew up in the Hospital after all they told her she was Loons the people in the City though were empty she thought it was like they never had their own thoughts or opinions on anything but she did she had concerns and questions and even hopes and dreams. It was just with no one to share these thoughts with she mostly kept them to herself plus she was Loons anyway so who would listen to her She had been given the job as Recorder several years ago when the old one was too old to continue. It was a solitary job no one really bothered coming into the Hall. Most of the friends shed had while growing up in the Hospital had all become shippers and they spent all their waking moments on the Shipper level and hardly stopped by to visit since they were so busy keeping the ship going. She didnt mind so much it was simpler this way.She stood pushing herself up off the chair. She stepped forward to the deck rail and watched Elder run his way down the Hospital steps take a hard left and head towards the wall of the ship. He looked around frantically casting nervous looks back over his shoulder towards the hospital. He hadnt seen her watching what with her being too far away and up on a hill he would have had to get very close to look up and see her but he was running in the wrong direction. She was curious why was he running what was he running from and where was he running to There was nothing in that direction except a small stretch of field and then the wall. Curiosity getting the better of her she decided to follow the future leader of Godspeed and see if he was alright. She would simply catch up with him ask him if he was okay and surely he was fine and then she would head in for the night. Simple.Elodie jogged down the stairs and over in the direction Elder had headed. By the time she had reached the wall she saw that Elder had stopped running and was instead catching his breath clutching at his arms as if he was shielding himself. She was just about to say something when he took off again slinking along the darkness of the wall following its curve. She was a few yards behind him he still didnt know she was there and she continued to follow him. She followed as he lead her unknowingly through the pastures and passed some sleeping cows and a few bunnies that hadnt settled in for the night quite yet. They passed the sheds full of animal feed and finally entered the City. It was brighter out here and Elodie suddenly felt like she was wrong to have followed him. She felt like she was stalking him and the bright lights were going to expose her. She slowed her pace and fell even further behind him. Eventually she broke off his trail and instead climbed up to a terrace above the Butchers and simply watched as Elder wove in and out of streets. It seemed he was trying not to be seen as well as he was taking extra care to avoid any people who were out late and shied away from too bright lights and large windows. Finally he reached his destination. Elodie watched as he glanced around one last time and walked up towards the Grav Tube that lead off the Feeder level and went up to the Shipper and Keeper levels. Of course Elodie thought hes just going back to Keeper Level. Eldest probably expected him back before the solar lamp clicked off and he must have lost track of time. Hes probably trying to sneak back to his room without Eldest finding out he wasnt there. Simple. She should have stayed back at the Recorder Hall and just headed to bed. Now she had followed a teenage boy on a silly whim and now she had to cross the entire Feeder level to get back. It would take hours She mentally cursed herself for letting her curiosity get the best of her and began to climb down off the terrace and begin her trip back home. Only she glimpsed something out of the corner of her eye that made her stay one more moment. Elder instead of opening the grav tube and ascending back to the Keeper level walked just off to the side of it where the side met the metal wall of the ship. He seemed to reach behind the tube which she thought was impossible she thought that the tube was flush to the wall and grabbed a hold of something she couldnt see. Suddenly the grey of the wall pushed inward slightly and for a moment Elodie thought the wall had given away to the great blackness of open space. Instead the only thing that happened was that Elder slipped into the blackness that had appeared in the wall and as soon as he was fully consumed by it the gray wall appeared back in its normal place. Had Elodie not seen it happen with her own two eyes she would have assumed nothing had happened at all. There was no evidence of a mysterious disappearing and reappearing wall ever existed and there was no trace left of the boy who disappeared to whatever lay on the other side. She couldnt bring herself to go back to the Hall. She sat there on the terrace waiting for Elder to reappear. She waited for hours and hours. She awoke the next morning to a man talking to her what are you doing on my porch he asked. She was startled and jumped awake. The solar lamp hadnt clicked on yet but she knew the City workers typically got up earlier than the lamp. It must be time for them to go to work. By all rights the man should be mad but he showed no emotion as her asked her what she was doing there.Sorry she grumbled I didnt mean to fall asleep here I was waiting for someone. Waiting for who This is my house. I was not waiting for you. He said. I know I must have... I must have gotten lost. she lied. She didnt want to argue with people who couldnt argue back especially not after such few hours of sleep on an uncomfortable terrace four stories off the ground. Im sorry to hear that. the man said maybe I can help you find your way. No thank you Im just going to go home. she said to the emotionless man. Sorry again. It is okay. Good day. the man said as he walked passed her and descended the metal stairs to the ground and headed to work.Elodie climbed down herself and rubbed her lower back gently when she reached the ground. Never again she thought will we sleep on metal terraces. She yawned and turned toward the Hall about to head home to take a shower eat something and then nap when she found her feet had other plans. Instead of heading back home she found herself turning heal and heading toward the grav tube and the mysterious wall. Oh what happened to my simple morning she asked herself when she found she couldnt find the will power to make her legs walk in the right direction. When she reached the wall she stared at it for a few moments. It looked the same as all the other walls. Same color same curvature same cool feeling when touched. Nothing was different. She looked around the sides of the grav tube and thought it wasnt strange either. She tried shoving her hand behind it like she had watched Elder do but she was right the wall and the back of the grav tube were flush there couldnt be anything back there. She was about to give up when she let her hand fall away from the tube. As it did it brushed against a slight indent that was right against where the grav tube and the wall met. So there was something there right where the two joined after all. Gently and now with a pounding heart she pressed her fingers into the indent. Nothing happened. So she tried again this time pressing harder. Again the wall did not fall away like it had last night. She thought a moment then tried locking her fingers on the edge of the indent and pulling. Thats when a small crack appeared. The City was still dark but she could hear people stirring behind their closed doors and drawn curtains. Soon it would be bustling with life as all the workers headed to their jobs and then everyone else would wake up too. She felt that this was something secretive based on the way Elder had acted last night and so she squeezed herself into the small crack. Once inside she couldnt see anything. It was pitch black inside the wall no City lights or solar lamp to add light here. Before she pressed on she pushed on the heavy wall that was really a door in an attempt to close it. When it didnt work she groped around blindly for another latch. Luckily she found it and pulled the door closed expecting it to thud shut but instead it closed with a sound no louder than a whisper. But even here in the secret place that sound was like yelling. She stood for a moment and let her eyes adjust to the darkness. Looking around she saw stairs a giant set of wide metal stairs that went up a few steps then spread out to a small landing as they bent around and headed up. Looking straight up she saw them stretch far out of sight and she figured they must go all the way up to the Keeper level. She also noticed that about two or three landings up there was a dull light. That must be where Elder is she thought but why is he hiding in hereShe was about to make her way up the steps and find out if he was okay and ask him what he was doing here when she was suddenly pushed against the wall that wasnt a wall and felt the edge of something sharp press into the side of her neck. She was pinned there her assaulter using his body to hold her in place one of their hands around the hilt of what was obviously a knife and the other had grabbed at one of her arms and was twisting it backwards. She was in pain and she was scared and her senses kicked into overdrive. Suddenly the dustiness of the place was unbearable and she felt choked she could hear and feel the assaulters heavy breathing against the back of her neck smelled the metal of the blade pressing against her delicate flesh and she felt something warm and wet on the hand that was being held by her attacker. She didnt want to think about what that could be. She didnt want to think about what was going to happen to her. She just wished she had stuck to her simple little routine and had never followed Elder here. And thats when she realized there was only one person who could be here.Elder she asked her voice hitching from fear and from the dust in this place. She coughed and immediately wished she hadnt as the force moved her even harder onto the blade. She hissed with pain as it nicked her. Who are you he asked. Elodie. she said. The Recorder. I know who you are. he said. He was the only one who ever went into the Recorder Hall and lately he had been spending more time there. She always left him alone figuring he was studying something for Eldest. What are you doing here I saw you Im sorry. I saw you run from the Hospital last night and then disappear here. I wanted to make sure you were okay. honesty was always the best policy right Thats what Eldest had always taught them anyway. Who else saw me He pressed the blade closer and this time she let out a yelp as the small cut got a little bigger. She could feel the blood trickling down the side of her neck. No one. No one else I swear. I was just curious and I shouldnt have followed you. Im sorry Elder. she cried. Dont call me that. he didnt press the blade closer but he did twist her arm more. Eld shite sorry. Im so sorry. Please let me go. She was fully crying now. Tears were leaking from her eyes from the pain and fear. I swear no one else saw me and I swear I wont tell anyone I wont tell Eldest if thats what youre worried about. You tell NO ONE. Elder hissed in her ear. Do you understand that Yes she almost yelled. Yes I understand He removed the blade from her neck and backed away so she wasnt pinned anymore but he kept his hold on her wrist. He pulled her along with him as he started walking toward the stairs. Elodie wanted to ask where he was taking her but was too afraid to ask. She had her free hand pressed against the cut on her neck as she tried to stem the bleeding. Luckily it wasnt near any major vein or artery and was no deeper than a nick one would expect from shaving too roughly. Elder brought her up to the third landing where Elodie had seen the light earlier and let her go. He sat down on a cot he had set up and she stood across from him too afraid to sit down. When he let go of her wrist she went to rub it to relieve some of the pain and saw that he left a bloody handprint behind on her skin. She looked up at him again and this time she noticed that half of the left side of his neck was ripped up and had a hole three fingers wide right behind his ear. Im sorry I had to do that. he said breaking the silence. Elder what happened she asked. I told you not to call me that. he said angrily. He didnt ignore her question however as he bent down and picked something small off the ground and tossed it at her. It fell with a clink to the ground at her feet and she took this as an opportunity to sit down. She picked the object up off the floor and held it up to the small lantern he had set up. It was a small chip with three metal wires dangling from it like a tiny octopus she had seen in a vid of Sol Earth oceans once only those things had 8 limbs and this just had three. She studied it a moment it was still covered in fresh blood and it dawned on her what it was. She dropped it to the floor immediately and backed away from it. Is that your wicom she asked with disbelief. Yeah. a smirk played on his lips. Had to take it out. Just got it actually. Which was believable since his hands were still covered in his own blood and if she was closer shed have noticed his continued bleeding. Are you frexing kidding me she asked. Elde NotElder what the frex is going on Youre still bleeding. He said looking up at her and drawing the attention away from himself. I dont care about that right now. She said. I do. He replied. Im sorry again. Didnt know who you were if I could trust you. She was taken aback by this. You can. He nodded. He picked up something from under his cot and walked over to her. She flinched away when he knelled down beside her and placed a cloth gently against her neck. Im sorry again. He said in response to her flinch. Yeah. was all she replied. She was sure he meant it why else would he be helping her clean it up now but she was still wary. She hadnt gotten out of here yet. With him this close all she could smell was blood. It was now that she noticed his own wound was bleeding and his was much deeper than hers. Youre still bleeding. she pointed out to him. He lifted his hand and placed it against his neck somehow not even flinching. Oh shite. Here. She took the cloth from him and held it against his neck instead. Youre going to die of bloodloss in here. You should get to Doc. No he yelled. Im fine. It doesnt hurt. It stopped hurting when I broke the skin. Im not leaving. Youre probably in shock That thing is going to get infected or youre going to bleed to death and I cant let you do that. she told him. You will. it was clear it was a demand. I am not leaving here. No one is going to know I am in here. Understand. Elder you cant STOP CALLING ME THAT he yelled and knocked her hand away from his neck. His yelling had put to much pressure on him and caused the wound to bleed more freely any clotting that had begun was broken. For frex sake let me frexing help you Tell me whats going on and let me stop that frexing bleeding she was yelling now the stress of the morning was getting to her and she didnt care if he killed her in his anger but she was not going to let him a teenager push her around without getting some answers after what he put her through.He paused and considered her a moment. Finally he decided to tell her his storyEldest is lying to everyone. he stopped again thinking about something about how much she should be told. Eldest is lying to everyone on this frexing ship and he wants me to lie to them too. I told him I wouldnt I couldnt lie to everyone even if its to keep the peace. I just cant and I wont. So he sent me to the Hospital. He told Doc to kill me. He put out his arm and Elodie saw there was a cut right under the bend of his elbow it looked as if a needle was pulled out the wrong way and instead of leaving only a pinpoint behind it was dragged along the skin and left behind an inch long gash. Doc couldnt do it. He didnt want to kill me. He let me go. I was planning on this happening Eldest had been threatening me for months about getting rid of me so I packed up things I needed and stashed them here. Its the old stairwell back before the grav tube was invented. Eldest doesnt know about it. I figured out how to trick the floppies so Eldest wont see any wicom signals from this place but I had to deactivate mine. If I ever get to leave this place I cant have myself showing back up on the map. Eldest everyone needs to think I am dead. he finished explaining and looked at her as if studying her reaction.What are you going to do she asked. I mean you cant stay here forever. Ill figure it out. he said. I should have plenty of time to think in here. They were silent. Elder was trying to gauge Elodies reaction as she was still chewing on all that he had told her. It didnt make sense to her. Eldest was a good leader. Why would he order his successor to be killed What was he lying about Surely Elder NotElder was wrong. But how could he be He wouldnt be hiding inside a wall in the dark with a hole in his neck if he was wrong.What is Eldest lying about Elder sighed. Everything. I cant tell you. You cant tell me what Eldest is lying about but you said you werent going to lie like him. she stated. She had gotten him and he knew it. If he lied now she wouldnt trust him and if she didnt trust him there was no way he could trust her to keep this all a secret. He sighed here he reached over to a crate beside them and pulled out a bottle. Elodie didnt need him to open it to know what was inside it so she wasnt surprised that when he did that there were small blue and white pills inside. The same pills she had been taking since she moved into the Hospital. Doc said they were supposed to make her less loons. I didnt know you were loons too. she said. He laughed. It was a harsh humorless laugh and he winced with pain as finally his neck was regaining feeling. Yeah see now you feel it. Elodie stated. Whats so funny about being loons Everything he said because were not loons. Yes we are Doc said so Ive been in the Hospital since I was 10. Ive been taking those pills for 15 years. she told him. Its all a lie. You notice how the people in the City are different dont you How they seem... empty. Thats not normal. Theyre supposed to be like US. Were the normal ones. he explained. You are loons she stated. No listen I know you see it. Theyre not right they dont think they dont feel they just do whatever Eldest tells them And us were normal because we think and feel and choose what we want and dont want to do Eldest is controlling them Eldest has this stuff Phydus and hes putting it in the water. It takes away their ability to think for themselves Everyone drinks it. Even us. But this he held up the pills these inhibitor pills prevent it from working. We dont take these because were loons we take them so we wont be mindless drones Elodie didnt know what to think all of this was overloading her. She needed time to digest what he was telling her needed time to figure out if he was actually so loons that he was making this all up. I should go. she said. She stood letting the bloody cloth she had been pressing against Elders neck fall to the ground and began to walk away. You cant. he called after her. She stopped dead too full of fear to keep walking. This was it she thought hes going to kill me he was never going to let me get out of here. Not yet. he continued. Please someone will see you. Youre going to let me go She asked and immediately wished she hadnt she didnt want him to think about it and change his mind. Yes. Im not a killer. I just... I just need to disappear. I need to stay here and think about what Im going to do how Im going to get the truth to everyone. I just need a way thats not going to cause a mutiny or get anyone killed. I need to protect the people. he said witch such sincerity that Elodie did believe him. Youre loons. she said turning back to face him. He smiled up at her. Maybe just a little.It wasnt very reassuring but she couldnt shake the feeling inside her that was telling her he wasnt lying. She knew deep down that the City people were wrong shed always known it and what Elder was saying did sort of make sense even if it did sound completely loons. What else is he lying about she asked softly walking back towards his makeshift camp and sitting down across from him. Like I said everything. I found out a few more things before he ordered Doc to kill me some big things even bigger than the Phydus. And I know theres more I just need to figure them out. One day Ill get out of here and I will figure out all this ships secrets. I cant tell you everything. Im sorry I just... its he started. You dont trust me. she stated. I trust you that you wont tell anyone Im here. he assured her. And I trust you wont tell anyone about the Phydus Eldest would kill you. He would not See you are loons she yelled. She couldnt believe that her kind and gentle leader was a killer. Look at me he yelled back at her. Im supposed to be the future leader and where am I Am I on the Keeper level training with Eldest Am I No Im sitting in a forgotten hole in the wall with a hole in my neck and a gash on my arm from where Doc ripped the needle out of my arm when he decided he couldnt bring himself to kill me something Eldest ordered him to do Hes not like you think he is He controls peoples minds to make them work He hides secrets even from his successors He tried to kill me Maybe youre so loons you only think thats what happened Maybe he was sending you to Doc to get better meds. Maybe he was trying to help you and you ran away Maybe hes looking for you right now worried that youve gotten hurt she argued. Hes probably trying to She was cut off midsentence when her wicom beeped three times. Comlink Eldest. a gentle female voice chirped into her left ear. She listened as her leader spoke his voice filling her head Attention Godspeed. It is with heavy heart that I am speaking to you this morning. I apologize that the news I have to report is devastating. Please sit if you are standing I do not wish anyone to be hurt if they become overwhelmed with shock I know I am. My friends my family Our Elder has passed on to the stars. There was an accident he acted recklessly and now he is gone. Do not worry there will be a new leader to take my place Godspeed must go on the mission will not fail but let us not forget him. That is all. Elodie couldnt believe it. She was wrong Eldest wasnt looking for Elder wasnt trying to help him. He really did believe that he was dead. And the way he sounded in his allcall... it wasnt right. Maybe it could fool the empty emotionless people of the City but not her. She heard not an ounce of regret or despair in his voice. He may as well have been reporting that the ship walls were still grey and the garden was still green. What did he say Elder asked. I know it was him what did he tell everyone I believe you. she said to him still so lost in her own thoughts that her voice sounded as emotionless as those in the City. Why he asked. He was dying to know what Eldest had said. He lied. she said. She pulled herself out of her thoughts He lied You were right. Tell me please. he asked again. He wasnt in the least bit upset. Not even a drop of sadness. Like it was the most boring thing in the world. she rambled speaking her thoughts out loud. You would think but he didnt. He doesnt care. And if he doesnt care then... then you were right. If he doesnt care its because he knew. Because it wasnt an accident. Because he wanted it... she looked over to Elder who wasnt Elder anymore. He said you died. What else he asked leaning closer to where she was sitting as if by getting closer he could hear the ghost of Eldests words echoing through her head. Just that there was an accident that you were reckless and now youre among the stars. That Godspeed will continue a new leader but you are dead. she summarized. He sounded bored not devastated like he said. You know why. NotElder said sitting back up in a normal position. Youre not lying. Elodie said. I told you Im trying to tell the truth unlike him. he said. I just need to figure everything out. How are you going to live in here she asked. Ive got enough stuff Ill figure it out. he said. Ill come out when I think its safe or when I need to like if I run out of food or something. Will you be okay she gestured to his wound. I wont rip anything else out of me. he smiled. Other than that I dont think anything else could hurt me in here. Unless I trip and fall down these stairs. He laughed. Elodie didnt find it funny. Dont do that either. He laughed harder but the laughing turned to a hiss as pain shot through his neck. No problem. he said through clenched teeth his hand pressing hard against the open wound trying to stop the pain but really only making it worse. That probably needs stitches. Elodie told him. But it wont happen. he said. Yeah I know. she sighed. What am I supposed to do now I dont know well wait out the day and when its dark again you can leave. You know you cant tell anyone. he told her. I know I wont. she promised. And you cant come back here. he added. What if I want to make sure youre okay she asked. You cant. he warned. You cant come back here if Eldest spots you or a shipper or anyone sees you disappearing into a wall... they will find me its too risky. Once you leave today you cant come back. Eld she stopped herself and sighed What if you need help Then I will come to you but you cant come to me okay he asked. Fine. she yawned the lack of sleep and the crazy morning finally catching up to her. Here he said getting up off his makeshift cot. You can sleep if you want you look tired. No I shouldnt. she said. She couldnt sleep in his little cot no matter how tired she was. It felt like an odd thing to do after he almost killed her and after Eldest announced him dead. It didnt help that the edge of the thin sheet on top of it was covered in blood. He should have pulled that thing out somewhere else she thought. Then shook her head chasing away the thought all of this was still loons. Well here take this at least. he tossed a pillow at her. She barely caught it her reflexes were so slow from fatigue. If itll make you more comfortable you can sleep on a different landing Ill stay up here. She considered this a moment. Realizing shed be here all day and admitting she was exhausted she took him up on his offer. Thanks. Dont worry about it. he smiled.She took his pillow and walked down to the landing below. From this landing she could still see the glow of his lantern as the light stretched its way down towards her but she couldnt see him. She didnt want to feel like she was being watched as she slept so being down here made her feel more comfortable. She laid down and got as comfortable as possible wondering if shed even be able to fall asleep what with her mind racing as it was. As she placed her head on the pillow she thought nothings ever going to be simple again is it Before she could spend time thinking about it she fell into a deep sleep.,Teen And Up Audiences,Not Found
https://archiveofourown.org/works/690121,Life After Godspeed,It was almost dark now only a small thumbnaillike portion of the higher sun was poking above the horizon. Stella knew she should be heading back toward the base if she was to make it to the mandatory meeting Zane arranged for the evening but her feet kept on pulling her forward. It was humid and her clothes stuck to her skin as she walked so when she reached a hill she considered turning back after all so that she wouldnt have to exert herself. Her legs seemed to have a mind of their own however and she hiked up the hillside anyway. Upon reaching the the top of the hill she saw a curious site that made her glad that her body had gone against her mind and brought her here. In the rapidly fading light any human would only have been able to make out the silhouette of a human body leaning against the lone tree that stood there but she was no human and her heightened senses were able to let her see so much more. It was a man one of the ones that had come from the ship Godspeed and he wasnt so much leaning against the tree as he was propped there his body seemed to be sitting there limply like a doll. Around his body were scraps of meat that were usually fed to the pteros as snacks. It was no mistake that this man was left here to be devoured and perhaps hed been knocked out or killed first which would explain his limpness. She had no idea how long the man had been there how long ago a ptero had been called and released. It was highly probable that the beast was on its way there at this very moment and the logical thing for anyone to do would be to turn and run as fast as possible. She put a hand to the tiny whistle she wore around her neck double checking that it was there which is silly because she was never without it before dropping her hand back to her side and walking toward the man. She didnt fear the pteros she was the one who raised them a job she loved and took pride in but she wasnt a fool either. She knew they were wild animals and her having a motherly connection to them didnt change the fact that they could still snap at her if they chose to and that was why she always kept the whistle used to control and tame them on her at all times. She stopped in front of the man who was definitely a site for sore eyes. He was bloody his skin ripped in odd ways bruises marked his body. His eyes were closed and his eyelids had dried blood on them as if they too had bled which was probably the case if the rest of his body was in a similar state. She knelt down by the man and placed her ear by his face listening for sounds of breathing. She heard none. She went to lift his wrist but upon touching it she realized something was off. His skin had a spongy feel to it and that sensation mixed with the sticky blood that caked his wrist caused her to drop it. She placed two fingers on his neck instead and placed her hear against his chest. There it was. A pulse. Whoever left him here must have either wanted him dead or thought he was dead. She knew it was one of her people who had brought this man here since no one else would have had the scraps of meat for the ptero and she had to give whoever it was the benefit of the doubt that they had no idea this man was still alive. One of us or not she didnt want to think her people were murderers. Still she wondered what happened between this man and one of her people that left this man bloody and dying on this hilltop. She didnt have time to think of the reasons now however and without wasting any time she gently scooped the man up which would not have been so easy as he was bigger than her if she hadnt had the strength of two men and ran as carefully as she could as to not hurt the limp man in her arms any further to one of the tunnels that ran to the underground base.,Teen And Up Audiences,Alternate UniverseRomanceDrama

https://archiveofourown.org/works/23872723,Allie - The teenage years of Alexander Horten,July 4 2015 Saturday Dear Diary Let me introduce myself. My name is Alexander and I am 13. For some reason everyone calls me Allie. I have long shoulderlength hair that is a small bit curly under my ears. I usually sweep it to the right to keep it out of my eyes. I am very small for my age I am the same size as my sister and she is 10 Otherwise I am skinny. People say 4 things when they think about me. I am very small for my age. My hair is long. I have a nice singing voice and I have long eyelashes.Today is my birthday. The most important day of my life. I am no longer a child. I am a teenager. I am also a middle child which explains why I just got you as a birthday present. Let me explain. Mom thought that Dad was buying me a present and Dad thought Mom was doing it. So this morning when I came down to show my new teenage self mom and dad looked at each other. Then Mom rushed to her room saying it was time for my present. I heard her swearing and drawers and doors being open. After me waiting and looking forward to the new smartphone I wished for so long Mom came down with a present packed in Christmas paper. It was you A diaryIt was hard to smile when all I got a diary as a present. Mom told me that this was very special. You would be a place to archive my deepest feelings and fears.... my soul. I will be honest a smartphone would have been better.My aunt came around later with a small cake she got at the bakery. She gave me a quick hug and talked with Sarah my sister. Aunty is my mothers sister but lives close by. She is not married and I suppose that is good because she hates men. Aunty has lots of money and lives all by herself in a posh house. This should mean that I get good presents but that never happens. I am sure she could afford a smartphone. She came with a cake and a book about horses.Mom couldnt find any candles and dad just put one of his cigarettes down in the cake after he lit it. The cigarette stood proud like a candle and smoke rose up from it. Dad was watching the news and wasnt paying attention. He told me to blow it out. We had cake with cigarette ashes powdered on top of it.I will always remember the day that I became 13 July 5 2015 Sunday Dear Diary Mom woke me up and told me we had to rush as we were late for Church. I nearly slept walked to the bathroom but could not get in. My big brother Billy was using the bathroom and this meant he would take ages. He is 19. He thinks he is so mature. I on the other hand do not think that he is smart. Maybe because this is because he only thinks about parties and girls. He often says he is embarrassed by his family and he doesnt want us to speak with him outside the house. Billy can be a pain but I love him as a brother.I waited for him to come out. I really do not know what he does in the toilet. I lost patience and went out in the back yard and found a secluded tree I could water. Dad had the same idea and was mumbling what Billy was doing all his time doing in the bathroomMom was like a busy bee. We were just about to walk out the door when she noticed my hair. She screamed that I could not go to Church looking like a hedgehog. So I was dragged in the house again and Mom started brushing all the knots out of my hair. She did not listen to my pleas and when I shouted in pain. Her mission was to make me look respectable. I told her I could do it myself if Billy did not hog the bathroom.The hair in the front of my head was long. It was not enough that it was just swept to the side. Mom said that no one will see my pretty eyes.PrettyShe had a solution. She used one of Sarahs hair clips to keep it where she wanted. I protested as I did not want any girl thing in my hair. As I protested Mom shoved me out in the car.When we came to the Church I went to change to my choir robe. I sing in the Church choir and still have a soprano voice. I loved this and it was the highlight of every week. When we got changed in our robes we went and stood where we usually did and waited for the priest. All the boys snickered when they saw Sarahs hair thing in my hair.Dad fell asleep during mass so he did not hear me sing. He is 47 and teaches at the school I go to. He is a very popular teacher and everyone loves him. The only problem is that when Dad does not work at school he forgets that he has 3 children and is too tired to be with us. Otherwise he is a huge Madonna fan so there is Madonna music all the time at our house. I do not understand her. One minute she is singing that she is a virgin and another minute she sings about... well you know.After Church my best friend Andrew met me outside Church. He was praising me to the skies telling me that I sang like an angel. I wondered how he could hear me sing as I had no solo today. Dad also praised me and told me how great I was. Did he dream of me singing July 6 2015 Monday Dear Diary We have two months left of summer holidays. I already miss schoolToday it hit me that I am now a teenager. I was no longer a child. I was on my way to becoming an adult. This means I have to be more mature. I have to be smarter and I have to look cooler than I do now. The teenage years are the path of what you will do as an adult So when school starts again I must study and nourish my brain so I could get a good job when I am older.I also needed Annie to know we would be happy if we got married. She is a girl in my class and I plan to get married to her. She has long wavy hair and a nice body. She looks like a goddess in the school uniform. She has long curly blonde hair so I am sure our children would be cute. The only problem is that she really had not noticed that I am alive yet.Yes I am a teenager now. I knew that it was time to get rid of all my childish toys and books. Just not today July 7 2015 Tuesday Dear Diary I had a long talk with mom today. Mom works at home. She worries a lot and has every book there is about raising a child. My mother does not like that we are getting older. She thinks she still needs to help us with everything. I think she dreads the day when we are so old that we will move and she would be alone with her books. Mom is 38. This often made me think that there are so many years between mom and dad. I told mom that I was now a teenager and had to look like one. Mom started to panic and said she read that this would happen. She would have a problem if I decided to be an emo or a rocker or goth. I told her that this was not my plan... yet. I just had three wishes.The first was that I did not have to wear cartoon briefs. Lets face it they are childish. I should be wearing designer briefs or boxers like any other boy. I told her that Andrew wears designer boxers. Mom asked me how do I know and then decided that she did not want to know.I told her that she no longer had to put out my clothes. I was now capable of deciding what I wanted to wear every day. If I got pocket money I could also buy my clothes.Finally I told her that I needed a hair cut. I explained that when people met me for the first time they often thought I was a girl. Mom explained that they were just jealous. This is something parents say to close a conversation.After I presented my demands mom squeezed me cheek and told me that I was cute. Then she suggested that we bake something.Sighs. July 8 2015 Wednesday Dear Diary When I woke up I found that Mom had put clothes that I should wear today at the end of my bed. So much for my demands. Maybe this is why I will be a teen for 5 yearsToday Greece was in the news. They are bankrupt and need money. I should be more politically interested and care about what was happening in the world. The problem is that I am bankrupt too. I still need a smartphone July 9 2015 Thursday Dear Diary I need a summer job to get money. It will also give me peace from my sister Sarah. Sarah is my sister and she is 10. I often consider Sarah like a small kitten that is so curious about everything. She talks a lot and has lots of friends. Sometimes she latches on to me and wont let me alone. Its really like having a radio except you cant turn it off. Sarah is the same size as me which is embarrassing but they do say that girls grow faster. Both Billy and Sarah have dark hair my hair is blonde.The problem is my only talent is singing. What could I do July 10 2015 Friday Dear Diary Mom has a tradition every year that she makes us stand against a wall after we had our birthday. Then she draws a line on the wall to show how high we are. I think I am too old for this. What will she do after I do this when I become 50 I heard that a human becomes smaller when they get old.When she was done I looked at the wall and nearly wanted to cry. I could see how fast Sarah was growing and my growth was not even noticeable. This made me stare in the mirror for a long time. How will Annie ever notice me if she has to look down at me What would my first kiss be like Will I need a ladder to reach herI decided that I must see if there was some way that I could stretch my body July 11 2015 Saturday Dear Diary Mom and Dad decided that they needed a day for themselves where they can be romantic and all that. I do not know why. They are already marriedMy brother decided to hang with his friends and Aunty said that she would take care of Sarah. Mom persuaded that Aunty to take me as well. Aunty did not know what to do so she decided that we should just drive until we found something exciting. I didnt like this. Aunty had a child seat in the back of the car for reasons unknown. Sarah was allowed to sit like any normal person while Aunty told me to sit in the child seat. When I protested she said that Sarah was too old to sit in a toddler seat. Did aunty not know that I was olderI felt like every person we saw as we drove could see me in this toddler seat. They were most likely having a good laugh. Sarah did not tease. She just told me that someday I would grow. We drove for two hours looking for something to do.Aunty finally found something we can do. We could swim at the beach. I told her that we had no swimming clothes with us. This didnt bother aunty. She said we could swim in our undies. Sarah had no problem with this but I stood there and said no way. Aunty did not understand my boundaries as a new teenager. She asked who would know meI do not know how I agreed to it. The next thing I knew was that Sarah and I were running towards the water and splashing. I started to think that aunty was right. No one would notice me as they did not know who I was. We were in the middle of nowhere. Far away from our home town.How wrong I could be. Despite we were at a place that was far away Annie was somehow there. She waved to me as she saw me in my lion king briefs and she was laughing.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/17338454,The Truth Unfolds,Waking up to gentle snoring behind me I could feel one of Jakes strong and warm arms wrapped around my naked torso. His front was pressed up against my side while I could hear his gentle snores next to me. I smiled inwardly. it had been a while since Jake and I had not only woken up together but been able to have dinner together and spend a very pleasant night together. Hed recently been working on a tight schedule doing some work for a very high business company. Last night was his last shift hed gotten the information and the client was all too pleased.As was I finally getting Jake back to myself.To be honest I had missed him. Terribly. It had shown at work as well. Chris Willows my temporary assistant manager while Natalie was on maternity leave had sent me home earlier that day when I may have snapped at his boyfriend Scott Wolf.In my defence Scott did start it stating that Natalie should be the one with the hormonal unbalance and not me.Before I could throttle him Chris dragged me into the office and suggested Id be better off at home to cool off.Adrien Chris started serenely while I was plotting sweet revenge in my mind for Scott. Since Jake has been on this new case youve not been yourself. Maybe youd be better off doing something to keep your mind off of things like youre next Jason Leland novelI tried not to groan but Chris was right it had been almost a month since Jake and I had really spent any decent time together and it showed how much I was missing him. Also considering the wonderful August heatwave we were having it was probably for the best I got out of there before the heat got the better of me along with my temperament. I headed home and found Jake was at home preparing a surprise dinner for me.My mood brightened immediately.As I stirred to wake I found myself nose to nose with big startling eyes staring into my own.I screamed jumped up as Tomkins shrieked and dived from the bed no doubt losing another one of his nine lives. I was certain he only had a couple left by now.Jake woke instantly behind me. What happenedBloody cat I declared before I even registered Jake behind me. My hand instantly went to my heart as I began to calm down.Jake took a moment then laughed. I turned to face him unamused as he was.Hey I told you to close the bedroom door. He stated leaning on his back looking at me.I stared at his rugged yet handsome look I did hes learnt to open it.Uh huh. He said it in a tone which I knew far too well he didnt believe me. I gave him a look which rewarded me in getting pulled back into bed with Jakes body on top of mine.I couldnt help but notice just how hard he was. It was stirring my own into life. After last nights serving of eagerly awaited rampaging sex I was surprised I was even able to muster a morning hardon. Even just thinking about last night made me harder.Jake started to rub his bulge against my own fabric against fabric. My boxers started to feel tight as well as slightly damp.Jake a moan escaped my lips as he tugged his fingers under the waistband of my boxers pulling them down freeing my erection. Jake left my boxers covering my knees as his lips found the crook of my neck my chest then onto my nipples licking and nipping at them. Making me harder.Jake I said even more eagerly than before.On hearing my protest he snickered but carried on with those tender lips of his. They moved onto my scar as he placed gentler but still meaningful kisses along the whole length of it. Moving ever so closer to the goal.Being my standing to attention cock.I could feel his hot breath over my groin feeling his breath breathe over it making a few of my hairs sway in his breeze tickling the lower part of my shaft. His mouth was near to me so near as his hot breath blew over me as the tip of his nose stroked the length of me nearing the tip of my cock. I felt a drip of cum dribble out of me as I felt Jake get into position.I wanted nothing more to be engulfed inside of him.Closing my eyes my hands grabbed the sides of my pillow. I knew I was going to be in for a good time.An extremely good time. Woof. Woof My eyes swiftly reopened. I turned to face the edge of the bed to find Scout sitting there happily wagging his tail as he watched us intently.Scout boy not now. Go go chase Tomkins. Serves him right for rudely waking me earlier. Go on boy. Teach that cat a lesson.Jake too had paused his attack on my body to study Scout but his eyes seemed to have realised something and he swore very loudly.Shit. He stopped his assault upon my body and to my dismay got up and left the bed.Jake I sat up stared at him bewildered. Im sure my cock seemed to be giving him a look of disbelief too as well as sheer annoyance.Jake turned back and looked just as annoyed as I did. Obedience class.It took a moment to sink in which it unfortunately did. Fuck I swore just as loudly as Jake had. Cant we skip it I asked knowing all too well what the answer to that was.Jake stared at me. You want that picture of you and Scout on the wall of shame cause Im telling you. She will put it there. He didnt wait for an answer as he quickly moved into the adjoining bathroom to sort himself out.A groan escaped my mouth as I threw myself back into bed. My erection swiftly went at the thought of Mrs Anderson the Class trainer demoralising us.We well I had been taking Scout to her classes since February of this year and things had gotten to a rocky start. Not our fault what with being kidnapped almost being killed having the press and the police interviewing you as well as the stores and Jakes workload piling up. We may have missed a few classes and Mrs Anderson was not impressed.The last time I went to her class last Sunday I noticed the picture of both Scout and me neared the wall of shame. The wall of shame is the only section of the room where our dogs were allowed to do their business if accidents happened and where all the cleaning equipment and drainage was. It also was decorated I say mildly with previous owners pictures which had been faded and stained with god knows what. One had actually fallen into the drainage a few weeks before it was still there.Basically we were headed to the gutter.I grimaced and Mrs Anderson noticed.Adrien. She spoke like an old headmistress of a school disappointed with her student. You and Scout have missed so many of my classes. When you do turn up I have not seen any improvement in him. You must attend regularly.I know and we are trying.She gave me that look as if I was a fouryearold telling a fib when the evidence was all too clear. Adrien Scout needs the work. I dont think youre committedI am we are. Both Jake and I have been doing our homework with him. He has improved a lot at home.Mrs Anderson pondered this then said Jake Ive not met him yet have I She didnt wait for an answer. Maybe Jake should come next Saturday. Im having an outdoors training session with another class. 9 am sharp.I nodded and told the good news to Jake.Today being Saturday and the time being 758 am.Thankfully Jake being used to working under pressure being a cop and all was quickly washed and dressed before I could even get out of bed. I sat on the edge of our bed as Jake put his sneakers on.Ill quickly feed them both then well be off Jake said kissing me on the lips. Ill see you tonight at the Willows.I blinked at him curiously.Jake stared at him. Youve forgottenWell I have been busy with my selfloathing of missing you. Alongside trying to sort out my next novel I think Im entitled to forget whatever tonight is aboutJake stared at me again and said quite flatly. Autumns birthday celebrations.Now I stared at him. Autumn Willows Chriss lovely adopted mother and her celebration 60th birthday at the Willows family home. I was certain the expression on my face said it all. Oh God I completely forgot. The shock was evident. It had slipped my mind.Jake snorted a laughed and walked over to me kissing my forehead. Its ok Baby I got us covered.When did you get the time I asked considering how busy he had been I was rather stunned.When your PA is the daughter and who has organised every inch of this birthday bash trust me you make the time.At that I laughed and was rather thankful for being sent home from the shop. If Rachel who recently appointed herself as Jakes new personal assistant discovered Id forgotten.Thats something Id not want to dwell on right now.You know you could always come with me Jake said dragging me out of my thoughts.As much as I would love to spend time with Jake and believe me I would. For once I take slightly longer to get ready as does Jake and spending the day with Mrs Anderson did not dwell well for my nerves. Or my empty stomach which I would have considering the time was now gone 8.Rain check I asked in my best none grimaced and trying to be innocent look.Jake grunted. Uh huh.I love you I said the fake looks gone with all the love I could muster this early in the morning.Jake at this kissed me more passionately on the lips. I wanted to part my lips and make it much more passionate but Jake pulled away.Love you too Baby.Once I got myself sorted 20 minutes later I heard Jakes Honda pull out of the garage and out onto the street. I hope the class today goes well for both of them. I was sure it would. After all Jake was good with dogs and Scout did listen to him. I was certain Jake would have Mrs Anderson eating out of the palm of his hand.Actually that mental image did not do well and I would prefer it to never enter my mind again.Ever.The bad side was I just wouldnt be seeing either of them until tonight as the class was a whole day event. I dreaded to think how much that was costing us.Heading downstairs I saw Tomkins quite happily curled up on the sofa and made myself coffee in the kitchen and tied up from the night before. Once refuelled and kitchen cleaned I headed towards my study and stopped in the doorway staring at my computer on the desk.Did I really want to spend another day writing a few lines of garbage on my Jason Lelands forth attempt at publishing I shook my head. Jason and I needed some time apart. Considering how badly it was going. I had decided on a different direction instead of it being based upon Shakespeares works it was based on his life. Jason had gotten a part in a film only to find himself on set with a stagehand head smashed in with a meat cleaver. Worst of all Id titled it to die or not to die. Staring at my computer I cringed at the thought of it. Im sure a day at the bookstore wouldnt hurt even if I knew my publishers were expecting a new draft sometime soon.I grabbed my car keys and headed to the Forester. Normally I had weekends off but with Natalie away with Angus a few hours at the bookstore wouldnt hurt. Considering my mood swings were much better Im sure I could deal with Scotts sarcasm too.,Mature,Not Found
https://archiveofourown.org/works/9841136,The Art of Deception,1There are times I would have had to admit well mainly to myself that my life has had quite a few dramatic moments. For instance being Jake Riordans boyfriend did have its moments some a bit rockyOk extremely rocky ones.But the good ones outweighed them by a ton. Especially when he asked me to become his fianc√©. Well things were definitely becoming much more interesting.After being proposed to in the early hours of New Years Day of this year with Scout our adorable but somewhat over excitable German Sheppard and Tomkins our cat watched cautiously from the safely of the bathroom as I cried.Yes cried men can happily show their emotions at the sight of the ring and hearing those words Adrien with an e will you marry me. I will admit my emotions were somewhat all over the place. We had after all spent New Years Eve with what will be my inlaws. I was overjoyed.I let Jake take me in his arms and lead me to the bed slightly awkwardly as I was trying to put my engagement ring on as he was hastily taking off both our clothes while trying to carry me to said bed. We managed just about.It was the perfect ending to the best way to celebrate the new year.Skip forward seven weeks on and as I sat in my office at Cloak and Dagger things in my life were definitely thoughtprovoking. For instance the scene which was unfolding right before my eyes.Natalie my sister shop manager and Angus her boyfriend and my store assistant were both bickering in the store about the baby. Natalie was almost two months into her pregnancy and even to this day Angus was still suggesting they should marry. I must admit that I was surprised they had stayed together this long and also Angus was still persistent on the marriage idea.It also accrued to me that telling both Natalie and Angus both Jake and I were engaged was probably not the best of ideas. Angus had this delusion that a double wedding would be perfect.No.Just no.I hadnt told Jake his idea which I know would result in a different answer. Something much worse but still on the same concept of no.Angus had dreams though it was just an irritation on Natalies part and a nightmare on mine.Just think He said quiet cheerily which was quite strange coming from someone who knows and studies demonology and who was currently in full goth gear I did notice a new skull piecing in his right eyebrow. We could have Tomkins as ring bearer just like in that film you like.Natalie sighed which seemed to be the 100th time this morning. God no Tomkins would freak and attack half the guests or hed be superglued constantly to Adriens head. That is the worse idea yet.My ears suddenly picked up Natalie had included me for the first time in their wedding ideas. Or like I call them disagreements. I truly hoped her thought was not for a joint wedding and I was just there as a guest.Adrien Natalie looked up at me from where I stood in the door frame of mine and Natalies office. Tell him this is a bad idea.As co store manager we both share the office I decided to promote her officially in January once we hired new staff which we did. Two new people to join our team. I let Natalie interview and begrudgingly hire the ones who seemed most perfect for the shop this was her first main job in being manager and to prove that I was not a complete and utter control freak.This almost killed me but I had to give Natalie credit. She did great.The lucky two candidates were great. I met them both on their first days here. The first one I met was Gemma Lockhart a 40 something I never asked her correct age as it was rude to ask a lady her age black woman with dreadlocks down to her elbows. She had experience working in a library for over 25 years until an unfortunate event happened when it got caught on fire. The place got torn down and rebuilt into restaurants. Gemma was a great asset with a great bubbly character.Currently she was dusting shelves near the front of the store trying to ignore the once again drama happening as well as deter Tomkins from attacking the feather duster.Christopher Chris for short Willows the other recently appointed assistant to the shop is a 25yearold Scottish guy with a British accent unless he swore or got annoyed which was hardly ever compared to others in the shop and yes I did include myself in that epiphany and who had the most amazing deep red mahogany hair that I had ever seen. I found out he was all natural. It wasnt something I was going to look into but with an unfortunate accident between Angus and Chris in the staff toilet apparently it was true.Which reminded me I needed to fix that lock.Pushing the image of a shocked Angus and a slightly freaked Chris out of my mind and my shock look when I ran in after hearing both of them scream at each other.Chris had currently moved over from the UK to live with his family for a year and was doing a small study part time refresher course on computers at the local university. Not that he needed it. He was very smart and on his first week working here Chris had fixed up the shop computer and store website to look fresher and better than ever. Our online customers quickly grew hence the ability to give Natalie her much needed pay rise.Needless to say we were both impressed.Even my old friends Jean and Ted in my old Partners in Crime writers group yes I still run the group even though it was now held once a month still on a Tuesday were impressed. I even saw them both trying to persuade Chris to quit and join them in their computer business. He declined which I was thankful for. His excuse was his years study visa wouldnt allow it what Ted and Jean wanted and offered but mainly it was because Chris truly loved books just as much as I did.His main love was for Agatha Christies Miss Marple but when I introduced him to Christopher Holmes Miss Butterworth series he fell in love with them. Sleuth novels he loved the most. Jake made a joke once that the only reason Chris stayed around here was because he loved my amateur sleuthing.I on the other hand was not amused by that.Also and I will admit this he was rather attractive. He was the same height as me and same build. Also he did have a health condition but I was told by Natalie who had all his details on file it wasnt serious. Just a skin condition which is why he always wore long sleeved sweatshirts which pretty much covered most of his hands too. I didnt find it odd actually it seemed normal compared to Agnus.Chris was a great worker once he was on something he got it done. He was always reliable which is why I also gave him a key so he could be in charge Sundays and close up Saturday afternoons so me and Nat could have those days off. Chris was definitely committed to the work and punctual.Except today today he was late and I was worried.No one else had noticed Natalie and Angus still bickering on our joint wedding day with Gemma ignoring it all I was the only one concerned. Why was I so concerned though It was only ten minutes past 11 the beginning of his shift being 11 but still. Something was wrong.Hello. Natalie said clicking her fingers right in front of my face. I suddenly jerked back but instantly regained my stance as Natalie looked concerned. Adrien are you okYeah yes sorry. You were saying I asked slightly forgetting what on earth we were all talking about.Natalie sighed It was nothing important.101 sigh of the day.Speaking of importance Have you heard from ChrisChris Natalie blinked and quickly glanced at her watch. Oh god hes supposed to be here 15 minutes ago has he calledI tried my best to not roll my eyes. Id been watching from here for the past hour or so listening to Natalie and Angus bickering over baby names weddings and Tomkins role in it all and shes asking me if anyones calledNo no he hasnt. I replied and tried to hide the anxious feeling deep down in my stomach. I couldnt help myself I cared about him. It was very much out of character.Natalie saw right through me and instantly pulled out her cell phone. Angus had gone back to sorting the new delivery of books which had arrived this morning. Gemma was now arguing with Tomkins to get off of the shelve she was trying to clean which of course Tomkins refused to move and tried to attack the duster she was holding. The only person I was completely focused on was Natalie. Phone to her ear looking quite anxious as I felt. Her eyes met mine. No answer.Suddenly the doorbell rang above the shop door and my eyes immediately moved to it. All I could see was red. The red hair of Chris all messed up and frazzled as his green eyes were wide eyed and frantic. Not so harshly I moved Natalie out of the way and quickly went to his aid as he collapsed onto his knees as if hed been running for his life. Everyone in the store turned to witness the event unfold before our eyes.I instantly wrapped my arms around Chris. Whats wrong I could feel him trembling as his pupils were huge.Scott Chris gasped for air as tears fell down his cheeks. My boyfriend hes gone. He finished as he collapsed into my arms.,Explicit,Not Found
https://archiveofourown.org/works/2009544,Family,I had been working on part of Cloak and Daggers inventory making sure to enter a few new collectibles I had managed to track down a few weeks ago when there was a knock at the office door. It was early afternoon sunny and warm on this particular summer day though you wouldnt have been able to tell from being in the back office. Natalie was on her lunch break and normally costumers didnt wander back into the office so the only person I could think it could bewould be Jake or maybe Angus. Sure enough upon peeking over the top of the laptop I saw Jake standing in my doorway. He was dressed in a short sleeved tight black shirt that showed off his impressively toned arms and chest his long strong legs enclosed in his much loved Levis. I had just seen him this morning when we had parted at Cloak and Dagger for work me at the store and he just next door working on paperwork for his most recent espionage case. The sight of him made me giddy. I smiled but it faded when I saw the expression on his handsome face. Forehead slightly wrinkled those kissable lips drawn in a frown. I blinked. Heyyou got a minute he asked. I nodded saving the information in the spreadsheet and gently pushing the laptop aside. Yeah of course. Whats up I asked offering my hands across the desk. Jake came into the office closing the door behind him and came up to the desk. His large warm hands rested over mine holding them. His palms were damp and my brows furrowed. Jake and I had been living together for a while now nearly ten months in fact five of those spent in the Porter Ranch house. It feltpretty amazing and living in the big house was working out pretty well for the both of us especially when we wanted to be together but have our own spaces. Jakewhats wrong I asked concerned. He took a breath looking at the far wall in thought. My mom called he started slowly turning his tawny eyes to mine. I was in shock and it showed. Jake squeezed my hands taking a breath. What um what did she sayI asked softly. The last we had heard from Jakes familyhad been during Christmas nearly six months ago. We knew his family well at least his mom had been trying to reach out to usactuallyjust reaching out to Jake. I didnt know where my standing was with Jakes oldfashioned Catholic family. I didnt really care if I was honest. I could give a rats furry butt what the Riordans thought of mebut I knew how much his familys opinion mattered to Jake. He was good at hiding itbut I knew it bothered him that since coming out they had shut him out. Going forty years in the closet and suddenly coming clean to a conservative family wasa difficulty I wasnt sure I would ever understand. But I wanted to be there for Jake and support him. Id do whatever he needed me to. She invited us over for dinner he said softly. I blinked staring and swallowed. She did Jake nodded squeezing my hands again. Yeah. Its umfamily dinner a barbequemy parents and siblingstheir spouses and kids will be there he said softly. My eyes widened. Everyone Jake nodded again. Everyone I tilted my head squeezing his hands. Did she really invite us both or I asked. I had a feeling the invitation had not extended to me. I wasnt mad about itbut I sort of wish Jake tried not to do that. Saying we were both allowed to tag along when in fact I wasnt welcome at all. Jake sighed releasing my hands and rubbing his temples. I said I wouldnt be there unless you could come too I told Natalie that Jake and I were going for a drive and I would be gone for the rest of the day. I didnt need to explain a thingmy face must have said it all. She told me she had everything under control and the two of us left to take a drive just out of town. We went by the beach bought some ice cream and went for a walk. You wanna talk about it I asked softly our bodies brushing gently as we walked slowly. Jake had been so quiet concentrated and it made my heart ache in a completely unrelated way to my open heart surgery. I dont know what to talk about Jake said honestly shaking his head. He ate his ice cream sighing. His broad shoulders sagged a little. I have no idea what to expect. Its my entire family. The only one Ive talked to is my motherand even thats a tough time. I dont know if she wants us to come orshes just being nice and hoping well opt out he said. I felt a flare of anger. Jake didnt deserve to feel this wayto have to walk on eggshells around his own family. And yetit was so strange. It made sense. Why Jake had done what he had done with Kate with the clubswith me. It hurt and it made sense. Id had time to come to terms with it but it was still a shock that his mom had reached out in such a big way. We knew this would be a thingit was so odd that it was happening nowmaybe because I was hoping it wouldnt happen at all. We had had ten months ofwonderful swoonworthy electric romance. I meanit wasnt perfect by any means. Jake worked late and sometimes so did I. We argued a little. But every day was a new adventure. We were happyin love. We were in love. That sentence alone was enough to make me want to face all the bigoted silly pretty arguments and hate the Riordans could throw our way. I stopped walking. Jake He stopped and turned looking at me. His face was soft curioussad. His hair was a beautiful mix of blond and silver. He had smile lines and crows feethigh cheek bones and a strong jaw. Jake practically glowed in the sunlight. He was breath taking. And he was mine. He came closer watching me waiting. I didnt speak. I leaned up on my toes in front of all the people walking by the water eating their ice cream or hot dogs talking and kissed him. It was a soft sweet kiss full of love. No one batted an eye. The world didnt end. It was wonderful. He tasted like the moose tracks ice cream he was eating. I love you I murmured whatever you decide to do about your familyI support you one hundred percent Jake stared at me for a long momentand I wasnt sure if I shouldnt have kissed him or if I had said the wrong thingwhich I dont know what that could have been. Listen Jake I think your family should take a flying leap And then suddenly strong arms had wrapped around me and warm firm lips were grinding into mine. I wrapped my arms around Jake closing my eyes. Very old Hollywoodbut wowwhat a kiss I had a chocolate cake in my lap while Jake drove to his parents house a bottle of merlot at my feet. I had suggested not goingif that might make things easier on Jake while being around his family but he had vehemently refused. He wanted me to be there. I deserved to be there. Itsurprised me and warmed my heart. I didnt really need any reassurance about Jake loving me butit was still nice. Anywaythe cake had been a disaster at first. I had suggested bringing something other than the wine and so was stuck making cake. I could not cook worth a damnand wellbaking wasnt any better. In the end Natalie and Jake had to come to my rescue before I accidently burnt down the apartment and Cloak and Dagger. They both finished making the cake and I was relegated to the couch until it was done. So here we were making our way to the Riordansand I was filled with nervous energy. Jake didnt seem to be fairing much better. ListenI dont know how everyone is going to react so just Jake started. He was gripping the steering wheel with both hands eyes straight ahead. I was prepared for anything and everything from a relatively peaceful if somewhat awkward evening to a full out fist fight. I was suspecting that I would probably get most of the disagreeable attitudes maybe even ignored butI didnt really care. I was dating Jake not his family and it didnt matter to me what they thought. I rested my hand on Jakes thigh smiling softly at him. Its okay. Whatever happens happens. Ill stick to you like glue if you want me to or I can keep a little distance if thatll be betterwhatever you think I said. Jake glanced at me the corner of his mouth tilting up a little. I want you close he replied Im justsorry in advance I shook my head and patted his knee. Dont Jake. Well see how this plays out. Its alright no matter what I said and I meant it. We pulled up in front of a nondescript white and blue shingled house in the suburbs of South Pasadena. It smelt like barbeque and a couple of kids ran into the front yard chasing one another and laughing. Jakes nieces and nephews no doubt. Jake took a breath after turning off the car squaring his shoulders. I unbuckled my seatbelt and he unbuckled his. He turned to me and I leaned in cupping his cheek and kissing him. He kissed me back. Baby he murmured softly and my heart fluttered like a bird. I smiled softly stroking his cheekbone as he reached up to brush his thumb over my bottom lip. This was probably the most intimate we would be able to be before we got back to the Porter Ranch house. That made me a little sad. I love you Jake said his hazel eyes seeming to take me all in. I kissed his thumb. I love you too I murmured pausing smiling reassuringly at him ready He kissed me once more nodded and we got out of the car. Things started out pretty well. Jake was attacked by the kids running through the yard two pretty blonde girls and cute redheaded boy. His nieces and nephew. Angela Margaret and Josephor as they liked Angie Maggie and lil JJ. I wasnt a big fan of kidsbut they loved Jakeand it was obvious Jake loved them. He had all three of them in his arms swinging them around and making them screech and giggle. Itwarmed me to watch him with them and I smiled. He set them down and introduced me. I wasnt sure what to expect when I was introduced. I would have been okay with just being Jakes friendbut to my sincere surprisehe introduced me as his boyfriend. Not partner not friendboyfriend. I was floored and proudand I would have loved nothing more than to jump his bones right there and then. Six pairs of eyes stared up at me and a chorus of hellos echoed from three small mouths. I smiled and waved letting the little ones know that it was very nice to meet them and how much I had heard about them. And I had. Jake loved these kids. Angie the eldest of the trio piped that there were several children in her class who had two mommies and two daddies and then she turned to JJ pressing her fingers to his arm and screamed YOURE IT and started running away. Maggie and JJ screeched and laughed running away from us and chasing after one another again. I turned to Jake blinking at him and smiling. He smiled back and jerked his head toward the gate that was open and led to the backyard. The real test then. Jake placed his hand to the small of my back as we headed into the backyard adult voices and laughter and the smell of barbeque wafted from just around the corner. The gesture was intimate but subtle. We had to play this carefully. I tried not to place myself on guard right awaybut I couldnt help it. These people started giving us a hard timeI certainly wasnt going to take it. The adults were a lot lesswarm than the kids had been. There were a few much younger children back here two toddlers and an infant. Jakes father was behind the grill his youngest brother the one I had seen at the hospital what felt like several lifetimes ago was standing by him a beer in hand. Two sistersinlaw the middle brother and Mrs. Riordan were sitting down in plastic lawn chairs around a picnic table with a red and white checkered plastic tablecloth. Jake Mrs. Riordan said standing. She had a young face and a slim figure. She had the blonde hair that Jake and his siblings had all inherited though it was much more silver than blonde now and Jake had her mouth. He was definitely his fathers son though. Mr. Riordan was a big man much more round than he probably had once beenbut Jake had inherited his body type. Tall and broad. In fact all the Riordan men were. There was a strange silence after Jake returned the greeting. I smiled a little heart hammering with nerves. You must be um Adrien Mrs. Riordan said coming around the table toward us. I nodded offering a hand to shake. Hi. Its nice to meet you I said. She took my hand giving me a little forced smile. Her handshake was a bare squeeze of my fingers. Like if she touched me more shed catch whatever I had. Well then. She said nothing in reply except to please call her Suzanne. Im Becca one of the sisterinlaws said standing up and coming over Im Tommys wife. She shook my hand firmer than Suzannes and made eye contact smiling softly and gave Jake a hug and kiss on the cheek. She was pretty with big blue eyes and strawberryblond hair a trim figure and soft features. The other brother Tommy followed after his wife. Danny the youngest brother stayed by Mr. Riordan who hadnt said a word he simply continued cooking. They were both especially stiff. Susan Dannys wife gave us a soft polite hello. I was introduced to the last of the nieces and nephews twins William and Nicholas and the infant Siobhan. Jim Suzanne said softly having moved to the grill and touched Mr. Riordans arm. Jim just shook his head still flipping burgers. Jake looked at his mom and lifted his chin. No skinoff his nosebut I knew he hurt. Umwe brought wineand chocolate cake I said softly smiling and holding both offerings up. Here I can take those. Would you like a glass We can open thiswe only have beer right now Becca said hands open for the bottle and cake. Oh thanks. No beer is good. We just didnt want to come empty handed I replied. She smiled taking the cake and wine. Thank you she said Ill put the cake with the other desserts. The kids will love this What kind of beer you drink Adrien Tommy asked opening a cooler. He had pulled out a Harp obviously for Jake. Whatever you got I replied not wanting to be picky at this point. Bass Harp Guinness Bud light Amstel Yeungling he rattled off. Yeungling is good I replied and he nodded pulling out a bottle for me. He opened them and handed them over to us. Things got a little better after that. I was mostly listening to conversation since it revolved around sports and Jakes PI work. I didnt mind. Jake stayed close checking up on me with glances and touches. I would smile return his brief touches. I was okay. This was okay. I wanted Jake to be okay too. Tommy and Becca asked about me my job hobbies. Talking about Cloak and Dagger and my books and writing seemed like enough fodder for conversation and it was pretty pleasant conversation at that. The kids came around looking to play and with subtle acquiescence I let Jake go. Who was I to hinder him He hadnt seen his family in months and he needed this more than I did. I watched Jake with the little ones for some time. He was really good with them humoring them with a game of Catch and DuckDuckGoose. Their laughter and shrill cries of joys filled the backyard. Danny and Jim steered clear of me which was fine for the most part. Suzanne seemed to make an effort to get them to talk to him and briefly chatted with me herself. No progress was made with the Riordan patriarch or his youngest. Becca and Tommy were the most accepting of the clan. Becca softly explained about their neighbors and kids friends whose parents were gay or lesbian and that they didnt discriminate. They were happy that Jake was happy. They were surprised of course but thought that I was quite a nice guy andas long as Jake was happy. It was weird but I was content in that I wasnt getting sucker punched and at least they were trying. Six months agowe were both sure wed never hear from Jakes family again. I think he deserved better and morea lot morebut this was much better than I had thought. The night wasnt as great as it had seemed though. It was late. The kids were stuffed with dessert and after about fortyfive minutes of sugar induced mayhem they were inside watching a movie andor sleeping while us adults were sitting around citronella candles drinking bourbon and whisky and the merlot Jake and I had brought. Jake wasnt drinking much and neither was I. I had decided to be the DD of the night but I think he was playing it safe. We sat closebut not quitecoupleytoo soon for that. I had a weird feelinglike this whole night had been too good to be true. Sure enoughI was right. Danny had gone to the bathroom and Jake had gone back into the house a moment later to grab a water bottle for me. The shouting started just a few minutes after. I was out of my chair in a flash but Becca caught my arm. Suzanne was trying to slow down Jim and Tommy was first into the house. I was on his heels breaking away from Becca. By the time I got into the house Tommy was trying to separate Danny from Jake yelling at him to knock it off but before he could get a good handle on him Danny got in a hit right to Jakes face. I gasped stunned at the sound of fist hitting bone. Jake grabbed his face breathing heavily. Blood was seeping through his fingers and onto his mothers tiled kitchen floor. His brother was bended over holding his hand. Tommy was standing between the two blocking them. If Danny wanted another hit he would have to get through Tommy but by the way he was rocking and holding his handhe wouldnt even try. Jesus Fucking Christ Jake The hell is your face made of Danny yelled. Suzanne was a flutter coming up next to me and then rushed into the kitchen trying to attend to both sons at once. Susan was at Dannys side trying to look at his hand and Becca was settling the kids. I was frozen for a moment trying to take it all in before I grabbed a roll of paper towel and was at Jakes side. Dish towel Jake said his voice more nasally since he was bleeding all over the placefrom his nose. I hoped it wasnt brokenbut it might have been. I dropped the paper towels and looked around grabbing a dish towel out of Tommys hand in the chaos. I pressed it over Jakes hands and he took it pressing it to his face. I knew I would find out what had happened later and I wondered if we might need to go to the ER. I had a hand on his back standing close to his side protective and watchful. My first coherent thought waswhere was Jim Get the hell out of my house said Jims disembodied voice. He wasnt shoutingbut his deep authoritative slightly inebriated voice quieted the noise in the kitchen. Everyone faced him standing at the opening of the kitchen. Jim please Suzanne begged softly. Jim stepped passed her into the kitchen and up to me and Jake. He glared at Jake. I realized thenthat I simply didnt exist. Get your homo faggot ass out of my house right now he breathed. Jake stared toe to toe with his father. He was a few inches taller much younger. He lowered the dish towel. His lower face was smeared with blood and I could tell there would be bruising. My heart pounded painfullyit made my scar ache. You could cut the tension in the air with a knife. Dad Tommy tried reaching for Jim but he shrugged him off forcefully. Danny was crowded in a corner with his wife a bag of peas over his bruised and battered knuckles. Jake took a deep breath and let it out slow. He didnt back down didnt look away. Yes sir he replied through gritted teeth. He reached down and took my hand shouldering past his father and out of the kitchen pulling me with him. He didnt look back. I spared a glance to Tommy and then to Becca who were standing in the living room off the kitchen looking stricken before facing forward and following Jake. His hand was sticky with blood and so was mine. For a moment I was filled with rage. I wanted to go back in there and pick a fight myself. Not that I would stand a chance. Who the hell cared who Jake was sleeping with Who he loved It didnt change who he was. But I calmed slowly. Thiswasnt my fight. It wasnt even really that. Jake had told a lot of lies had hid for a long long time. That kind of stuff didnt justgo away. There was a lot of resentment there. We grabbed up our things and made our way back to the front yard. Jake gave me the keys and we got to the car. Uncle Jake called Angie from behind the glass of the front door. She ran out of the house and Jake went to meet her his face looking slightly less grizzly. He scooped her up and held her close murmuring to her softly and she clung to him. Tommy was on the stoop and came over slowly. I watchedmy heart breaking. Tommy and Jake spoke softly and Tommy squeezed Jakes arm before Jake handed Angie over to her father. He turned and came back to the car head down and the dish cloth pressed back to his face. I watched him unlocking the Honda and we got in starting it up. We sat with the car running for a few moments to catch our breath. Nearest hospital is two milesIll direct youpretty sure my nose is broken Jake said nasally. Okay I replied driving down the street you okay Yeah he replied.,Mature,Not Found
https://archiveofourown.org/works/23380504,Valley of Diamonds,Helen Blythe glanced over the wares in the marketplace. She and her sisters Margy and Rose were there looking for things to liven up their new apartment as well as shop for groceries. It had been a few weeks since they moved to New York City after the death of their father. Their only living relative their fathers older sister was too far away for them to travel with the little money they had and their aunt didnt have quite enough either having to take care of her ranch so they thought it best to rent an apartment and work for a time. Helen and Margy were both old enough that they didnt have to go live with their aunt and Margy wanted to try her hand in some business so with Rose in tow they figured they could make it work. Margy had found a job as a secretary for a wealthy woman named Dorcas Pepper and Rose insisted on finding a job as well so Helen could stay at home and paint commissions. Not to mention Rose couldnt cook to save her life. Margy and Helen were always joking that Rose would have to marry a chef in order for her family to survive. They were teasing her about that yet again when Margy stopped Rose from picking up nothing but junk food. Oh but its easy to fix said Rose. You never know if I want to give Helen a day off from the kitchen and would like to not have to burn anything. She reached into Helens bag and plopped a strawberry into her mouth. Besides not all of it is junk food. Margy scoffed. Well Im sorry youre right not all of it is junk food but you do pick the easiest things to fix. Rose flipped her light strawberry curls over her shoulder defiantly. But of course I know what I can fix and what I cant Helen laughed. Then all we have to do is find you a guy who can fix what you cant Which is pretty much everything added Margy with a snort. The two laughed. Rose shook her head goodnaturally. Tease me all you want just you wait Ill marry someone rich and neither one of us will have to cook she said with a merry twinkle in her greygreen eyes. Margy scoffed. Youd have to get that position at that fancy store if youre ever going to meet a guy like that. Rose pouted. And to do that you need experience To start at the bottom you have to have experience And pray tell me how are you supposed to get that She glanced at Margy. You got lucky with Miss Pepper she at least will help you get that experience.Margy nodded as a slight shiver went through her body despite the August sun bearing down on them. The girls nearly ran out of money before she applied with Miss Pepper and got the job. Miss Pepper was even kind enough to give her an advance to keep the girls afloat until Margy got her first full paycheck. It had been a close call to be sure and a lucky break. Rose still wanted to find a job but could continue her search at a slower pace now that Margy had a large enough of a paycheck to get them by. If she hadnt applied for the job with Miss Pepper . . . A cry from Rose shook Margy from her melancholy thoughts. She was pointing at the docks her face alight. Helen had turned and shielded her eyes to look at the setting sun. Can we get some fish Well maybe but we do have to make this quick its going to be dark soon and I want Margy to get to bed on time. Well then Margy shall choose shell make a quick decision. Rose looked pointedly at Margy. RightMargy grinned. Definitely quicker than you kid. But she still took a while there were so many different fish to choose from The street lamps were flickering to life one by one by the time Margy finally selected some tuna and tilapia even though the sun hadnt completely set. You said you were going to be quick. Did that handsome fisherman distract you teased Rose. Oh cut it out kid that guy was obviously almost forty The three laughed as they began to make their way back home. They had just left the marketplace when they heard cries for help from one of the alleyways. The three paused terrified. It was obviously two male voices calling out for help surrounded by the sounds of a struggle. Rose stepped forward to help but Margy held her back. What are you doing Are you nuts But someone has to help Then we find help said Helen with finality. Come on if we split up we might be able to find an officer or at least enough help. Rose and Margy nodded and the girls separated. Rose dashed towards the street hoping she could find a policeman in the dimming light. Help Help Somebody help I need help She turned and saw a big policeman rushing towards her. What seems to be the problem miss he asked in a slight Irish accent. Two men . . . in a fight . . . back alley . . . hurry She pulled on his sleeve but he followed her without further prompt. She rushed back to what she thought was the scene of the fight only to find that it was all over and her sisters had found help as well. Well by golly she did find an officer Way to go Rose blushed at the young mans praise. In the waning light Rose could make out a dark head of hair but what really drew her in were those grey eyes of his. He was standing in the light in such a way that his eyes seemed to reflect the light making him look suave and mysterious all the while Rose could tell there was a fiery life in him. Then he smiled and Rose had this sudden desire to wrap her arms around him and never let go. She noticed the man standing next to him looked like an older version of him. His father perhaps And its Officer Marks Fantastic Was just going to whistle for you said one of the other two younger men. He had light brown hair and merry twinkling brown eyes that seemed to be laughing constantly at the world but there was an air of seriousness about him suggesting to Rose that he was already working his way up in the business world. The other fellow had sandy blond hair and bright blue eyes that seemed to soak in the scene around him like this was his first ever adventure and he was enjoying it. Well it looks like youre becoming a regular ole deputy Bret Hartson having these men all captured really pretty for me Bret smiled sheepishly. Uh thanks Officer but we didnt nab all of them. There was a third one and he got away. He turned a serious eye on Margy. But that young lady there seemed to recognise him. Rose turned wide eyes upon her sister. Margy nodded and sighed. I did recognise him. Hehes Rex Pepper the nephew of my employer Miss Dorcas Pepper. Helens hands flew to her mouth while Rose gasped. Marks gave a low whistle. Why dont you call up Mr. Pepper real quick see and hell tell you these blasted fellows jumped us and . . . What kind of a fool do you take me to be Lefty barked Marks. Weve been on the lookout for you three for the past six weeks We just didnt know Rex Pepper was the third man in your group. But now that weve got you and Bo all we have to worry about is Rex and that shouldnt be too hard considering he enjoys pestering his aunt. Margy nodded vigorously. Oh yes he most certainly does And pesters me too Marks tipped his hat to her. Ill be glad to get him to stop pestering you both. He glanced at the two criminals. Once these two are taken care of. He glanced at the gentlemen. If you four would be so kind as to help me escort these two to the station Im afraid I cant do it myself. The blueeyed lad and Bret answered quickly in the affirmative. The greyeyed teen glanced at the older man seeking his decision. Well he began slowly we could help but we were on our way to meet someone a friend of a friend and it is rather important . . . Oh come on Dad we did tell him we would be late. I certainly wouldnt want to keep him waiting all night. Marks shook his head. I think youll be fine the station is only a couple of blocks away. You could escort these two and be back here in about ten minutes twenty tops. The gentleman glanced over the group. His eyes seemed to linger upon Margy for a brief moment before turning back to the officer. Alright then we shall help. Marks smiled with relief. Thank you so much After he slapped some handcuffs on Lefty the little group marched towards the station. The girls were thinking of simply staying with the fellows until the station before heading home but the older gentleman requested practically pleaded that they wait for them to come back out. The girls finally agreed to do so and waited just inside the station foyer.What do you think he wants asked Rose. Margy bit her lip. Ill bet its because of Rex he must want Miss Peppers address to call on her and talk to her about it. He might even call on us . . .Oh I would have no problem with that said Rose somewhat wistfully as she glanced at the door they had gone through. She was hoping to get another chance to see such a lovely pair of eyes.Rose said Helen breaking into her thoughts. You like his son already Rose blushed slightly. Well why not He is amazingly handsome and they must be rich. Did you see that watch Rose My goodness you just met the man berated Margy. And how are you so sure hes not already taken You said so yourself hes amazingly handsome other girls will see that too. Rose pouted. I hadnt thought of that. Well thats part of your problem you dont think. Alright you two enough said Helen firmly. Were still in the station we wouldnt want Officer Marks to have to arrest you two for disturbing the peace. Oh goodness Helen began Margy but she was interrupted by a loud whoop. The guys came back all wearing big grins. Now Dad and I wont take the money no matter what you say. Oh but began Bret but the older gentleman raised his hand with a commanding smile.Theres a reason why we wont we cant take it. How about you come to our hotel room tomorrow night at eight Ill explain everything then. He glanced at the girls. You as well. And as a matter of fact . . . he pointed at Margy I need your employers address. I would like to invite her along as well. Margy winced. Well I dont know. She doesnt particularly like giving her address out to people. Even so I would still have to have her permission to give it out . . . You will see her in the morning Margy nodded. Yes. The gentleman quickly wrote in a notepad. Then I ask that you give her the invitation instead then. He ripped the piece of paper out and handed it to Margy. She glanced at it and her eyes bulged. Youre youre staying at the Biltmore Hotel Mr. Edwards Roses mouth dropped as she glanced over her sisters shoulder. No way She glanced at the gentleman and his son. You really are wealthy The two chuckled. Yes and we shall explain everything if you come tomorrow said the son his grey eyes twinkling merrily as he seemed to take Rose in. Well thats what she thought he was doing looking at her like that. Oh my where are our manners We havent been properly introduced Helen began the introductions and the girls soon found that they were talking with Malcolm Edwards and his son Ralph Bret Hartson and Jimmy Stone. Malcolm glanced at his watch and gasped. Ah Ralph its getting real late I hope we havent kept our friend waiting for long He glanced at the five. It was a pleasure meeting you all and I hope to see you tomorrow You can count on us chorused Bret and Jimmy. Well come said Helen Im curious as to what this is all about. So am I said Rose. She glanced at Ralph and it would give her a chance to get to see him again. Very good then I shall see you all tomorrow. We would escort you ladies home . . . Dont worry about it Mr. Edwards Jimmy and I can handle it. You get yourselves to that meeting. Malcolm smiled at Bret. Thank you Bret. Until tomorrow. Bye said Ralph with a wave before the two dashed out the door. Bret and Jimmy did escort the girls all the way back the five chatting away almost like old friends. The girls learned that Bret and Jimmy were both orphans like them though Jimmy had no living relatives and Bret had one mean aunt who didnt seem to mind at all that Bret was out working for his own rent. They soon learned of the girls history as well and were rather excited to have made friends with people of a similar history. But though they parted rather reluctantly they were excited at the prospect of seeing each other again the next evening and finding out what secrets the Edwardss had to tell.,Teen And Up Audiences,Adventure Boys - FreeformBlythe Girls - FreeformStratemeyerAfrica
https://archiveofourown.org/works/12437532,Ephemera,ISLAND July 10th 1944 Letter from Alison Mannering to Polly Sullivan Darling PollyYour offer a little while ago to take the children for the holiday was very kind and meant in the spirit of reassurance but Im afraid I may have to ask if that offer still stands To put it simply Im struggling. To be able to afford to keep the children in boarding school I have to work extremely hard Im starting to be able to count the hours per day Im not working on one hand but to that end to have the children home for the summer would mean I couldnt work as much meaning I couldnt afford to have them there. Its a vicious circle one which I would love to break one day but for the moment I dont see any other way. Ive been extremely ill the last few weeks and the doctor has tried to restrict me to bed rest and then light duties but that would not help in the slightest.Of course if they were to come to you I would be helping with the costs of keeping them and put some towards your bills I understand Jocelyns book is still in the early stages and wont be earning anything for a while. It would just be Dinah for the first few weeks as Philip suffered a bout of scarlet fever and has to make up the work over summer so hell be staying with a Mr Roy until its complete. Ill arrange all the train tickets and times and you could just send JoJo to collect them from the station.Please would you consider I would be ever so grateful and it would give me time to get my strength back. I dont want the children to know Ive been ill as I think it would worry them so.You loving sister Allie July 13th 1944 Letter from Polly Sullivan to Alison Mannering Dear AlisonOf course my offer still stands. With your help to the costs of the children it would actually be a relief to have two extra pairs of hands around the house. JoJo does a fair amount of the maintenance but sometimes he disappears when hes needed and is a little unreliable and his personality is just ghastly. Dinah would be useful for the daytoday cleaning and chores and Philip could aid JoJo. Send me the details and well arrange it.Alison please take care of yourself. I know that being just you all the responsibility falls on your shoulders but there is a fine line and if its affecting your health you must rest. You are no good to the children in hospital and I would hate to receive news that youd ended up there from working yourself too hard.I will try and talk to Jocelyn again about moving closer to you but hes as stubborn as anything and will not leave CraggyTops especially whilst hes in the middle of the book. Apparently it requires him to be on the coastline hes writing about despite the fact he never actually leaves his office hes exasperating I truly believe if I kept the curtains closed he wouldnt know if we were in the middle of a city or a desert. If we were in a smaller place I could be of more help to you but CraggyTops is a fulltime project to maintain.Take care Polly July 17th 1944 Letter from Alison Mannering to Polly Sullivan Dear PollyI promise I will take care. I am considering taking on an assistant to help me but that would be more of an outlay and I dont think I can afford it at this point in time. I will have to make some decisions soon.Ive sent letters to Philip and Dinah explaining the situation and included their train tickets. I can send some extra clothing for them to you as their trunks will mainly have their school tunics and uniforms. Please let me know if there is anything else you may need.Ive attached their itinerary for you. If anything urgent crops up send me a telegram.I cant thank you enough. I hope to be able to come down to see you before the end of the summer.Love Allie Letter from Alison Mannering to Dinah Mannering Darling DinahIm so very sorry but you wont be coming home with me this holiday instead youll be staying with Aunt Polly and Uncle Jocelyn. I know youre disappointed but I have to work and it wouldnt be much fun for you being left at home most of the time. At least this way youll have the opportunity to explore the coast and CraggyTops. Philip loves stories of smugglers perhaps youll find some caves or hidden passagesPhilip will be staying on at one of his tutors homes for a couple of weeks to catch up on his work so it will just be you at first. Aunt Polly has asked if you can help her around the house. I know you will youre a good girl. I will miss you terribly but I hope to come down towards the end of the summer and settle any arrangements for returning to school so I can spend some time with you then.Please do write to me Id love to hear what you two are up to. Aunt Polly already knows but if there is anything urgent just send me a telegram and Ill come as soon as I can. Your train ticket is in the envelope too please dont lose itYour school reports are exemplary and Im so proud of you. Youre growing up into a wonderful young lady.All my love Mother Letter from Alison Mannering to Philip Mannering Dear PhilipI do hope youve recovered well from your bout of scarlet fever. The school have made arrangements for you to stay with Mr Roy for a couple of weeks just to catch up with the work you missed. I know its awful and Im sorry you have to lose some of your holiday to do so but it will be over soon and youll have the rest of the holidays to enjoy. There are a couple of other students who are having to do the same so you wont be alone.Ive sent a letter to Dinah already unfortunately Im just far too busy at work and much as I would love to have you both home I cant. Aunt Polly has agreed to look after you for the summer and I will try my best to come and see you before the end of the holidays.Your train ticket is in the envelope too Aunt Polly will probably send JoJo to collect you from the station. Please be good for her and help her in any way you can. I will miss you both terribly. Write me when you have time.Love Mother July 28th 1944 Telegram from Polly Sullivan to Alison Mannering Dinah arrived. Will write. August 2nd 1944 Official dispatch to Det. Insp. Cunningham Report re. Operation Ersatz. August 3rd 1944 Report from official logs Det. Insp. Cunningham Coastal bound. Visual reports received. Will update. August 11th 1944 Letter from Polly Sullivan to Alison Mannering Dear AlisonI can only imagine you werent aware of the situation with Philip he arrived yesterday with two more children in tow another brother and sister. From what I gather they are orphaned and live with an uncle who does little to care for them. The boy was at the same summer schooling sessions as Philip and the sister was there to keep him company. The uncle has fallen ill and is unable to take care of them so Philip invited them to stay here without asking my permission mind you. Again its useful to have more hands around the house and the money that the housekeeper was going to forward to the tutor is going to come to me to help with their upkeep. I have spoken to all parties involved and they are happy with the arrangements as am I.I thought Id best update you. Im happy for them to stay if you dont mindI enclose a letter from Dinah. Hope you are well.Take care Polly Letter from Dinah Mannering to Alison Mannering Dear MotherYou will never believe what happened Although Aunt Polly has most likely told you so maybe you can...Philip arrived yesterday from his summer school and there were two others with him Hed told me about them in a letter and they sounded wonderful. Their Uncle has recently fallen ill and their housekeeper sent a letter to the tutor asking him to care for them for the summer but Philip thinks he didnt particularly want to so he brought them back here. Aunt Polly was awfully cross at first but once she spoke to the housekeeper she was told shed receive the cheque that would have been sent to him and I think theyd much prefer to be with us than at a stuffy old tutors house. We get on like a house on fire.Theyre called Jack and LucyAnn Trent and have red hair and freckles all over their faces. Philip calls Jack Freckles because of that and Jack calls him Tufty because of our hair. Jack is around Philips age and LucyAnn is a year younger than me. Its funny to watch them because she adores Jack and he doesnt seem to mind but theyre so completely different from Philip and me. If I followed him around the way LucyAnn does Jack he would probably slap meJack has this pet parrot called Kiki who is an absolute scream. Shes very talkative and loves learning new phrases and noises. Aunt Polly didnt want her first of all but she flew onto her shoulder and started saying Poor dear Polly and Aunt Polly thought Kiki was talking about her so she let her stay. She does this impression of an expresstrain going through a tunnel which makes us jump but Jack tells her off when she does.LucyAnn and I are helping Aunt Polly every day and the boys do fetching and carrying but try to stay out of the way of JoJo who has an awful temper. He doesnt like us. Were exploring the beach and Jack is watching as many birds as he can because hes absolutely mad on them. Philips got some horrid pets and keeps taunting me. I wish you could tell him to stop.We miss you Mother. Weve told Jack and LucyAnn about you and I think they would both love you especially LucyAnn. Dont work too hard.Love Dinah August 13th 1944 Letter to Dinah Mannering from Alison Mannering Darling Dinah and PhilipYes Aunt Polly did tell me about them. She is happy for them to stay so of course I dont mind please tell her that but I am extremely cross with Philip for organising it without asking. I will be having words with him when I next see him your aunt is tired enough as it is without two more children to look after.Philip does have a way with attracting animals is this somehow working with people as well As long as the pets you mentioned stay near him and arent diseaseridden things and Aunt Polly doesnt mind then leave him be. I dont want you two getting into fights over it.I expect you all to behave and Im glad to hear you are helping her as much as you can. I do hope you have time for fun too. LucyAnn and Jack sound wonderful and I cant wait to meet them. It must be nice to have someone your own age other than Philip around. Dont be getting into any troubleLove to you all Mother Report from official logs Det. Insp. Cunningham Visual identification made. Linked to Sullivans CraggyTops. Two adults four children. No indication of involvement. Radio soon. August 19th 1944 Letter from Polly Sullivan to Alison Mannering Dearest AlisonI apologise for the need for this letter but unfortunately circumstances are such that I have to put an awful imposition upon you. The children stumbled across a police investigation in which JoJo was involved and unfortunately our water source has been tainted due to the criminals damaging an underground passage which flooded the well with sea water. Jocelyn and I have to move as quickly as we can and whilst I know and understand you yourself have not been well recently I feel that to involve the children would not only be unfair to them but would be extremely stressful for both Jocelyn and me.Please could you collect them at your earliest convenienceYour sister Polly August 22nd 1944 Journal entry Alison Mannering Pollys last letter was rather unwelcome and illtimed but when I arrived at CraggyTops I could understand the need. Both she and I have been ill recently my doctor declaring I needed bedrest due to burning the candles at both end and working myself to the brink of exhaustion so who will be working to pay both Pollys and my bills but whilst she isnt working and looks after the children for me she does need to deal with the stress of moving suddenly and having not just my two but four of them underfoot would only add to it. The last few days I have been feeling a little more myself and it wont be long until the summer holidays are over and the children can go back to school so I went to collect them and to offer any help Polly might need.The children are of the age where they can go off and keep themselves amused without the need for adult supervision but at the same time are led by their curiosity and this apparently led them straight into a police investigation into a counterfeiting ring located on the island just off the coast from CraggyTops. When I arrived I could see Polly looked as bad as Id been feeling. CraggyTops isnt the most habitable of places at the best of times but without fresh water its completely uninhabitable. Polly says its a blessing in disguise because shes been trying to get Jocelyn to move for years but he refuses at least now she can find somewhere smaller and more manageable. Theyre going to rent somewhere locally until they find a cottage or similar but the process takes a few days so Im staying with them and the children so there are extra pairs of hands to go and collect supplies from the town cook and clean etc until they can move out.I spent the day helping Polly pack what she could and listening to the children telling me about their adventure. Some of their descriptions of what theyd done made me feel positively ill but Im proud of them. Dinah and Philip may have their moments of hotheadedness but when they found themselves in tight spots it sounded like they kept cool and planned their way out instead of panicking. The news that a rather large reward will be coming their way thanks to bringing the case to a close is welcome indeed and Philip has already told me he wants me to use it to stop working so hard for them. This brought a tear to my eye and I hoped that Id hidden exactly how much Id been unwell from them as I didnt want to worry them but its such a relief.Jack and LucyAnn are lovely and Dinah and Philip told me a little about their past. I feel its the least I can do to offer to take them on I know Ill be able to provide a loving home and they can attend the same schools as Philip and Dinah. I feel my two are growing up too quickly but I cant help but admire them. I was still rather more interested in books and painting than finding adventures at their age.This evening I cooked for Polly she had a few bits around the larder and I cobbled together some sort of pie. The detective that the children had become friendly with over the summer had spoken to Polly and said he would bring some supplies for us to tide us over for the couple of days left here and he turned up with a crate of ginger beer much to the childrens delight and a huge thermos of tea for us adults. We invited him for supper Polly was probably just being a good host but I must admit I had a slight ulterior motive. The man is very handsome Hes tall and broad shouldered and I can imagine very strong especially from what the boys have told me. When he took my hand to introduce himself Detective Inspector Bill Cunningham although the children know him as Bill Smugs he just exuded warmth and confidence. He was constantly smiling at the childrens antics and stories during dinner and has the time and patience for each one including Kiki Jacks parrot. She is certainly going to take some getting used toIt may be wishful thinking and Ill probably not see him again but I couldnt resist looking at him multiple times during dinner and Im sure that he was doing the same. Our eyes kept meeting and hed give me a smile before looking away at whomever was speaking then. The children were allowed to stay up later than usual before saying goodbye to him but he did stay for a short while after they had gone to bed. Polly begged off claiming she still didnt feel quite right and she was looking rather pale so she followed the children upstairs. I had some washing up and tidying to do and Bill he wouldnt hear of me calling him by his rank helped me despite my protests. We made small talk as we did and soon everything was cleared away and while he seemed like he wanted to stay for longer he had to get back so I saw him to his car. He knew the children were likely to want to stay in touch and so we swapped addresses before he left.I feel like a schoolgirl with a silly crush. Hes a highranking policeman based in London and Im a widowed mother of now four children. But its nice to dream. August 31st 1944 Letter from Alison Mannering to Det. Insp. Cunningham Detective Inspector CunninghamPlease accept my most grateful thanks for the cheque forwarded to us in the post. I have to admit I questioned them on providing the reward when all the children really did was to stumble across your investigation but my concerns were brushed away and I was told that not only was the department extremely happy to reward the children in return for everything they had done but that you had put in a good word for them and they couldnt very well go against you nor your superiors.Philip wanted you to know that the money has allowed me to take some time off work and focus on our small cottage ensuring that I can start on the repairs weve needed for a while. Jack and LucyAnn have settled in well for the short amount of time weve had together they start their next year at school in a few days and theyve gone from moving their meagre belongings into the cottage to frantically packing their trunks for the term ahead. I will pop up and visit both schools during the half term but wont see them properly again until the Christmas holiday when they will be staying back at the cottage.The children have been asking after you and would like to know when they can see you next. I told them you are a very busy man and may not be able to spare some time but they have been rather insistent. Please find the telephone number of our residence below if you would rather not call I completely understand. You are always welcome to visit.All I can do is thank you again for everything especially for making the start of their summer such a wonderful time and for looking after them when they became involved with those men. Without you I dread to think what could have happened.With warm regards Alison Mannering September 1st 1944 Personal journal entry Det. Insp. Cunningham Finally finished full report of investigation. Prelims had been filed last week but think the involvement of children threw a lot of people and had to double up on debriefings because no one seemed to want to believe me even with the supporting reports of Sam and the others. Still cant really believe it myself so not too surprised Im under some scrutiny.Never met kids like them. Had their heads screwed on right for their age and were pretty vital to the outcome. Had they not come calling I probably wouldnt have had the chance to get to know them and gain intel on JoJo. Their statements were filed with the reports so the department reviewed them and decided to send the family the reward they had on offer for any information re the case. Had a letter from their mother about that this morning. Alison Mannering. Met her when she came to collect the kids to allow the Sullivans to move and it has to be noted she is an extremely attractive young woman both in looks and personality. Did look a little tired and strained though kids mentioned shed been working nonstop to support them so sounds like the reward couldnt have come at a better time. Spent that last evening on the coast with them for dinner and stayed to help Mrs. Mannering clear up when Mrs. Sullivan and the kids retired for the night. Conversation flowed and we swapped addresses because we knew the kids would want to stay in touch hence receiving the letter this morning. Intriguing woman. Cant wait to get to know them all better. September 3rd 1944 Letter from Det. Insp. Cunningham to Alison Mannering Dear Mrs. ManneringThere is no need for your thanks the kids earned that reward. I have to say they are a smashing group Ive never met any with such enthusiasm for life and new adventures. They proved themselves to be hard workers when they wanted to achieve something such as learning to sail my boat and while their inquisitiveness may have led them into the counterfeiting operation they kept level heads and made escape plans. There may have been a certain amount of luck involved but I was glad to have them on my sideYou must be very proud of them indeed they deserved everything they received and have been the talk of the department since.How have they taken the change in circumstances You are an admirable woman for taking on two more children but from what little I know about their situation I can tell that they will have a much better and more stable home environment with you. LucyAnn appears to be the most sensitive of the bunch is she adapting wellThank you for the number. The nature of my job means I sometimes have to disappear without warning or am called away on assignment with immediate effect. If this happens please do not think I do not wish to communicate with you or the kids I just may not be able to.Like I told you at the Sullivans please call me BillKind regards Bill September 12th 1944 Letter from Alison Mannering to Det. Insp. Cunningham Dear BillIn that case you must call me Allie. Yes I am very proud of the children. Like you said they showed maturity beyond their years in dealing with the situation. I can only imagine the tales being told and possibly exaggerated at school especially the boys. Jacks copper nugget was the first thing he packed in his trunkI believe theyve taken the changes well but it remains to be seen. Its nice for Dinah and Philip to have others their own age as they are sometimes too similar in temperament and quarrels are frequent. Im looking forward to Christmas now to really spend time with them and get to know them. I think LucyAnn is a sweetheart and hope that she doesnt lose her innocence too quickly. Shes been staying close to me in the runup to term and I think its both the novelty of having a maternal figure in the household and a way of coping with changes. Dinah told me quietly that LucyAnn said she adored me so its wonderful to know Im doing something right.Are all your assignments as dangerous as this one I cant imagine being summoned or sent away without warning for weeks on end. I caught Philip packing a book on the police force when he left for school so I believe you may have inspired a future career choice.Warm regards Allie October 3rd 1944 Personal journal entry Det. Insp. Cunningham Ship out to France tomorrow. Already been there twice on the intel that some German spies have slipped through the net and are making their way here. Both times intel let us down. One name in particular is starting to crop up again and again so am going to liaise with French branch of ICPC. Looks like I might be in for the long haul again unless this guy trips up along the way and hes too professional for that.Still havent been allowed to forget the fact the kids helped me close the last case not particularly doing wonders for my reputation but at the same time the guys cant believe I dealt with it pretty much without them. I keep joking Im going to replace them all with the ManneringsTrents. Even the Commissioner finds the funny side. He agrees with me says hes got plenty more room for consultants like that criminologist hes good friends with and if they just happen to be children then so be itTrying to keep in contact with them but finding it difficult at the moment being in and out of the country. Havent yet responded to Allies last letter. Really dont want her to think Im not interested in correspondence but in the current climate I cant risk any of my letters being intercepted. May have to send a quick card in a bit let them know Im thinking of them and will speak properly soon. December 19th 1944 Letter from Alison Mannering to Polly Sullivan Merry Christmas dearest Polly. I hope you and Jocelyn have settled in well to your new home. Jocelyn must love the fact its still coastal so he can work on his book do you think hell have it finished this year I may be able to put him in touch with some publishers if he hasnt some lined up already.Are you recovered and well The last few months have allowed me to get back on my feet properly and I feel very much myself again. The cottage is having small works done for now and I think Ill rent a place for the summer holidays and let the builders do the bigger renovations and decoration whilst were away so we can move back into the completed project.The reward from the department was rather more substantial than expected especially as the children each received a share and immediately asked me to put it towards the home. All four of them are such kindhearted selfless characters. Ive budgeted carefully you were always teaching me to be careful with money so during the term time I continue with my business and during the holidays I focus on the children and employ someone to run the agency for me. I might pick up the old paintbrush and canvas soon its been so long since I was able to paint for myself. Ive taken the advice of our bank manager and set some aside in separate accounts for the children. Hopefully in a few years time the money will have built up a little but if they want to use some now then they are more than welcome to I try to pass on your sensible approach to such things.Please find enclosed a small present from all of us. You have been so supportive and helpful even at the extent of your own health and now we are all in a situation to be able to we want to return the favour. I know the downsizing has cut down on your bills but I do hope this goes a little way to allowing you to treat yourself.As always I know the answer but if you could convince Jocelyn to part with his books and maps for a few days we would love to see you over the holidays.All my love Allie Card from Alison Mannering to Det. Insp. Cunningham Dear BillHappy ChristmasAll our love Allie Philip Jack Dinah LucyAnn Kiki December 21st 1944 Letter from Polly Sullivan to Alison Mannering AlisonI dont know how to thank you. I can imagine you saying not to downplaying your gift but its truly wonderful. Even with the sale of CraggyTops and the new place being far more manageable Jocelyn is focusing so much on the book his usual paying clients for papers and short essays are being left by the wayside so there is little income. Your cheque has gone a long way to pay for some essentials and yes youre right I will treat myself. Lord knows Jocelyn will forget its Christmas so I will just have to buy myself a present.Have you heard from that nice detective the children met over summer They seemed friendly enough with him and that evening he stayed for supper he certainly seemed interested in you.Were having trouble with the phone lines here at the moment but as soon as theyre up I will call you. You do know the answer I would love to come but Jocelyn wont and I dont know if I can leave him here for a few days to fend for himself. Its highly likely hell not eat the entire time.Your sister Polly Card from Det. Insp. Cunningham to Alison Mannering To the ManneringTrent clanMerry Christmas to you all And keep out of trouble this holidayFrom BillAllie apologies for radio silence. Investigations underway. Speak soon. December 27th 1944 Journal entry Alison Mannering My first Christmas with four instead of two I was hoping to make it special for them all but especially LucyAnn and Jack. I had the time to find them some lovely presents and made some too for Jack and Philip I found the new Paul Temple detective novel not entirely sure they believe that Im acquainted with the author torches their old ones suffered rather in those mines on the Island of Gloom and some Swiss Army knives and for the girls I made them a dress each bought copies of the Girls Own Paper and a few trinkets. As I get to know Jack and LucyAnn I can buy them more personal things but for now I was trying to get the balance right with them and my two.Kiki wasnt left out I treated her to some sunflower seeds but also a whole tin of peach halves. I made sure Jack would ration them as I dont want to make her ill but she seemed extremely pleased and spent ten minutes on my shoulder rubbing her head against my cheek and murmuring silly nonsense to me. Shes a daft bird but intelligent and its surprising how quickly Ive become used to having her around the house after so long with peace and quiet but she still does catch me out every so often with that awful impression of an express train and I have to tell her off. Its like having a fifth child around.Dinner was an enjoyable affair I did my best with what was available in the local shops but were still being rationed and Im making do and making up where I can. The children didnt seem to mind and most of it was polished off so I have the rest for leftovers for the next couple of days along with the ham I cooked off and left to cool. I always think thats the best part of Christmas the leftovers.Spoke to Polly and she sent her love and apologies. I didnt expect anything less but it is a shame I miss out on seeing her this time of year yet again. Ill try and organise a day to go and visit her with the children to do my sisterly duties maybe over the Easter holidays. I also had a card from Bill Cunningham which does explain why my last letter went unanswered. Its always a worry when someone says they want to keep in contact and dont and I know he did warn me that sometimes hes unable to but theres always the concern that theyve moved on and decided they dont need that correspondence At least the children know hes still around even if hes mostly silent.Sent a card to Louise Temple but didnt hear anything back I know since she married Paul shes become rather a high flyer and seems to be in and out of the country with as much frequency as Bill. Hoping to renew our friendship properly since I have a little more free time on my hands but theyre now solely based in London and have sold the Evesham place so its not as easy as just spending a couple of hours catching up.LucyAnn had a few days of illness not long after they broke up and returned home. I love Dinah and Philip dearly but neither of them are particularly affectionate and Im lucky if I get a peck on the cheek from Dinah. LucyAnn however is extremely free with her affections and Im constantly being hugged. I think the combination of large changes in her life together with the excitement from the summer had taken its toll on her and shed managed to keep it mostly at bay but she hadnt been sleeping properly for the last few weeks of term so Dinah told me in her last letter and it all came together in the form of a nasty cold. She came downstairs looking a bit feverish in the middle of one night when Id relaxed in the comfy chair and although I offered her some medicine she refused it just wanting to curl up with me. I held her for a while and we talked about families. She asked about John and I was happy to tell her I dont want her to feel like she cant ask me anything. Just as she went to sleep she murmured Its so wonderful to have a real family Aunt Allie. Thank you for adopting us. I would love a father too but Im glad we have you. Youre worth two parentsDesperately trying not to think of a certain detective theyve all but adopted as a father figure.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/23900719,The School of Adventure,A brief introduction The Triplets mainly Len have started a school at Kirren Bay. Their main students so far are children of young adventurers and relations such as Felix and Felicity Maynard Kevin and Kester Russell and Lens own step children John and Josie Kirren also twins The school is set up for both mainstream education and also alternative approaches to keep the young adventurers interested. It is also to have an emphasis on skills for escaping adventurous situations. There are a lot of characters from the original Chalet school as well as many from Enid Blyton. There are also some characters who I have made up so if you are struggling to guess the crossover check with me as there may well not be one The timing of this story is approx 1963 to 1964 DONT NEED TO READ BELOW UNLESSS YOU GET CONFUSED BY THE MASSES OF CHARACTERSIF HAVENT READ ALL CHANGE THEN CHARACTER SUMMARIES BELOW SHOULD TELL ALL NEEDED THOUGH MAY GET SOME SPOILERS. Character list and Summary for All Change madness and The School of Adventure I do know the storyline of All Change was a bit bananas even I look back and go eh on occasion. Therefore I thought this might be useful if I do mention past situations in the new drabbles since the characters are often based on other childrens stories. Also it is quite fun writing and reading the summaries I think reminds me at least of having people giving me the characters that they remembered loving as a child and the challenge I set myself to fit them all in Therefore if you dont want spoilers for School of Adventure etc bear that in mind if you read now then come back for a re read later this may change over time.KIRRENSGe George Kirren Partnered with Len.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/866713,All Change,1947George Kirren and her cousins Julian Dick and Anne sat in the car thoroughly bored with the journey. I still think its a stupid idea muttered George. Itll just be another excuse for the press to try to catch us out in a lie about our adventures and its getting really boring. Julian ignored her his nose in a book. He had listened to and responded to this grumble for the first few times but George was just getting annoying now. Dick who was just as grumpy as George about being stuck in the car gave a groan. Will you GIVE IT A REST he growled. Were going now whether you like it or not. George subsided briefly then began to mutter again. Young Adventures Conference huh... Like they can tell us anything we dont need adults telling us how to do things...stupid name too sounds like a mountain animalYAC stupid name for a stupid conference... Anne had had enough. GEORGE If you dont shut up I am going to get the driver to stop the car and you can just GET OUT AND WALK. And without Timmy too theres no reason that he should suffer for you acting like a three year oldEveryone looked up at this most UnAnnelike comment. She glared around at them all. Yes I have a limit And you have just passed it so SHUT UPEveryone went very quiet in the car even Timmy moving from having his head out of the window to lie himself down by Georges feet.Anne sat in silence herself fuming. She was going to kill Dinah Mannering when she saw her. Dinah was herself sitting on a train with Jack Phillip and Lucy Ann. She was happily planning her surprise for George and was completely unaware of the stress she was causing Anne. She had sworn the younger girl to secrecy and pretended to George that the conference was a stupid idea and that she wouldnt be going. This was one of the reasons that George was so grumpy since she had been looking forward to a whole weekend with Dinah without school or parental supervision. They had only got together fairly recently and time at their boarding school was generally supervised or limited. Lucy Ann looked over at Dinah and sighed. She didnt look likely to be spending much time with Dinah this weekend from the dreamy look on Dinahs face. Normally she wouldnt mind Dinahs plan to switch so she could share with George. It would at least mean that she could spend some time with Anne instead.But Anne was herself newly enamoured of a childhood friend Guy Seymour and all term Lucy Ann had been polite about his picture and talked about when they might get married so many times that it was beginning to become very hard not to snap at Anne. Lucy Ann looked out of the train window moodily thinking about how annoying it was having everyone trying to pair up all the time at the moment. Even Jack and Phillip had taken to sneaking out to see two girls they had met in the village coming back in the middle of the night and waking her up when they clumsily climbed in the bathroom window. In a different carriage Mike Jack Peggy and Nora Arnold were sitting happily chatting together. Prince Paul had had to return to his own country for the holidays otherwise he would have been there too. Making the most of his absence Peggy was affectionately teasing Nora about Paul. Nora was studiously ignoring her while her bright red face showed that the words were hitting home. Having been friends for years they had suddenly started to become shy around each other and Peggy was pretty sure that she could see a romance beginning to develop. Nora was doing her best not to be drawn into telling anyone anything. Mike and Jack were goodnaturedly joining in with the teasing until Jack saw that Nora was starting to take them a bit too seriously and told the others to stop. He changed the subject and Nora was able to drop back into her own thoughts for a bit. Frederick Algernon Trottville called Fatty by his friends looked around at the other Five Find Outers. Now this is our opportunity to find out some good detection and mystery solving techniques he announced slightly pompously. And I am sure that we will be able to pass on some of our own skills as well. We must surely have had more adventures than most of the people there... Larry Pip Daisy and Bets all just nodded. To be honest thought Larry he really wasnt interested in detection skills anymore. It was only because the others had wanted to go so strongly and the only way Pip and Bets would have been allowed to go was if Larry was there too to supervise. Larry thought moodily about all the work he still needed to get done for exams and tried not to show on his face how little he wanted to be there. YOUNG ADVENTURERS CONFERENCE The conference began with an opening speech by Inspector Jenks then some questions from the press. What do you have to say to the accusations that you are using these groups of children as a front for sting operations and police malpractice asked one reporter. No comment the conference is about building skills and sharing information I will not discuss any of the allegations you can contact the police press office for any further information. said Inspector Jenks.How is this conference being funded surely you are not spending public money in giving some attention seeking teenagers a free holiday asked the next reporter. Inspector Jenks replied in steely tones. The conference is funded by a budget that is less than 1 of the money each of these groups have saved the police over the past few years.Ah so you are using public funds persisted the journalist.Sitting in the audience George rolled her eyes at the same tired old questions. She sat sulkily waiting for the inevitable Surely these children should be prosecuted for repeated breaking and entering not to mention recurrently setting Timmy the dog onto members of the public. She held onto Timmy firmly. One national newspaper owned by the brother of one of the criminals that they had caught had started a national campaign recently to have Timmy taken away from her suggesting he was dangerous and aggressive. She couldnt help worrying that they might succeed. Finally the press conference was over and they filed into the conference hall. George looked at her itinerary and groaned at how much there was to get through. The first speaker a short bespectacled man in a green coat and round green bowler hat began his talk. His assistants in the demonstrations were a young journalist with reddish hair and a tuft sticking up at the front and a tall man with a black beard and wearing a naval captains hat. They seemed to be mainly occupied in making sure that the Professors inventions did not manage to leave the stage and harm anyone. George wondered vaguely whether the young journalist was a relative of Phillip and Dinah with that tuft of stubborn hair on the top of his head. Looking at the itinerary again she saw that he was French so it didnt seem that likely. With a thrill of recognition she heard a voice from someone behind whisper in her ear. Hello there fancy meeting you here...Dinah leant over Georges shoulder making the hair on the back if her neck stand on end at how close she was to her. This one is a waste of time like we ever needed inventions on any of our adventures. Coil of rope and a tin opener thats all we ever needed. And some rugs where possible.... And the one after is just some old authoress. What do you say to coming to check out our room George was quite happy to do this. They made their excuses and left Lucy Ann and Anne making so what is new faces to each other while Julian looked after them with a vaguely puzzled expression.

Lucy Ann escaped the stuffy conference hall for a break. Seeing that Anne seemed to be well occupied with showing Guys picture to some of the American young adventurers she made her way out into the garden for a breath of fresh air. Bit much that lecture wasnt it came a voice from her left. She turned to see a friendly boy with spectacles and a cheery smile. He was also one of the American delegates. Hi Im Bob Andrews. From California. Im one of the Three Investigators He said handing her a card with three question marks on it. She looked at it and said Oh. Thats nice and put the card in her pocket. Bob grinned. Finally Someone who doesnt look at the card and wonder why there are question marks on it Ive always thought it was damn obvious myself. Do you mind if I ask your nameOh I sorry Lucy Ann Trent. she said. He looked expectant. When she didnt carry on he said OfOf what she replied in some confusion. He grinned. Now thats refreshing too maam. Nearly everyone here seems to think they are the only ones in the world who have adventures. I was expecting you to give your group name or what youre famous for doing. Lucy Ann grinned. No we arent famous really though we do have adventures. I think some people here are famous though. I know the Kirrens are pretty well known and I think someone said there was someone here who used to be a child actor. Although I have never heard of him I have to say. Bob cracked a huge grin at this. That would be Jupe Jupiter Jones he said pointing to where a stout young man was signing autographs for a gaggle of girls with no clue that they were only asking for them to have an excuse to stay near his fit and muscled fellow investigator Pete. Lucy Ann laughed and apologised Bob instantly saying that it wasnt necessary and joking that Jupiter needed a few people not knowing about him every now and again to keep him bearable to be around. The bell went to indicate that the break was over. Lucy Ann left Bob reluctantly and headed back to sit with her family and the Kirrens. Bob went back to his friends getting some good natured teasing from them both about his beautiful red head. He bore the jokes with good humour deftly turning the conversation away from him by asking about Jupiters apparent fan club. He winked over at Lucy Ann when she looked in his direction and was touched to see her blush. She was quite pretty he thought to himself. Across the room Mike Arnold was trying not to stare too obviously at Lucy Ann. She had been sitting next to him at the press conference and he had been trying to get up enough courage to approach her all break time. He scowled to see Bobs wink and went back into the room in a sulky manner that warned his family to keep well away from him.Back in the lecture theatre a tall lady with long dark hair put up in earphones at either side of her head was discussing her adventures and how she had turned them into a source of profit. Her slightly old fashioned and foreign appearance put the young delegates off from the start. Unfortunately one common attribute of young adventurers was a need for action often physical action and sitting in a lecture theatre all day listening to adults was a very hard thing for them to do. Noticing the general restlessness of the young audience the speaker stopped describing a discovery of some salt caves and called her dog a huge old St Barnard to her. Now I can see that plenty of you have animals with you. I want to introduce one of my greatest friends Rufus The young adventurers stirred up a little at this and looked at their own pets who had often been great help and comfort in their adventures. Seeing that she had their attention at last Joey Maynard nee Bettany continued the talk emphasizing how Rufus had protected and helped her or her friends in their adventures. By the time that she reached the serious part of the talk they were used to listening and had recognized a kindred spirit in this adult. As the talk came to an end there was a brief break while the next speaker came on stage and set up their presentation materials. George and Dinah slipped back into their seats with suspiciously wet hair. Luckily for them Julian was distracted by a debate that had started between Jupiter Jones and Freddie Trottville about the best methods of disguise and detection technology. Nora Arnold who was in the row behind looked at the girls thoughtfully especially Dinah who was trying not to react to Phillip pretending he had lost a pet snake under her chair. The next lecture began and the stories of Nancy Drew and her friends kept the momentum going well although it had to be said that very few of the audience paid much attention to the legal warnings that her father gave them along the way. At last it was lunchtime. The young adventurers bounced out of the hall and went in search of refreshments. Mike stood at one side of the room trying to not be too obvious about looking over at Lucy Ann. Peggy with a plate full of food came over to stand with him and followed the direction of his gaze. Shes very nice you know she said casually. Wha...who ... Er... She is said Mike in some confusion. Peggy smiled. Why dont you go over and talk to her she said. Shes busy right now said Mike indicating Bob Andrews who had just appeared in front of Lucy Ann with two full plates of food. Peggy nodded. Bob is nice too Mike we had a good chat at the orientation meeting. I dont think you should let him put you off. Go over there and introduce yourself. Just dont get him onto methods of filing or record keepingMike just shook his head and went off in a different direction to get some food. The afternoons workshops went well although Josephine Bettany had had to be called away due to some issues at the school she was involved in. Apparently the only way the problems could be solved would be if she was present despite her having left there more than a decade before. The other advisors were very useful however and Freddie was soon in detailed discussions with Bill Cunningham about how he should prepare for and apply to join the special services. Mike had a good discussion with Chief Inspector Jenks about what routes were open to him which were depressingly few. He had been unlucky enough to be caught trespassing and breaking and entering without being able to prove that there had been criminals present to justify the actions. Since he had turned 16 when he was caught the offences were now on his record and he was already finding career doors closing to him because of it. Chief Jenks was sympathetic but because of the current media attention he couldnt risk doing anything to help officially. Finally the day was over and the youngsters were glad to escape into the open air. Dick Kirren and Peggy Arnold let off steam by having a competition to see which of them could walk furthest on their hands to cheers from many of the delegates. Peggy won by a few feet then toppled over almost into Freddie Trottvilles lap. She apologised with a laugh and he grinned at her quite pleased by the turn of events. His young friend Bets looked briefly sad as he set off for the hotel chattering happily with Peggy then shook her head knowing that Fatty wouldnt ever see her as anything more than a type of younger sister. She started up a conversation with some of the American delegates and was soon happily involved in a discussion with Nancy Drew about how she might work towards setting up her own detective agency. The evening wore on. A function room had been taken over for a dance and the delegates were enjoying some activity after being still all day a state that was not natural to many of them. Julian Kirren had for once let his sense of responsibiity go and was dancing energetically if inelegantly with one of the female American delegates Bess Marvin. George Kirren and Dinah were again nowhere to be seen and Anne had also disappeared suspiciously early after receiving a message from the hotel reception as soon as they entered the hotel. Lucy Ann was quite happy however discussing methods of organising things with Bob Andrews. It was nice to find someone else who was just much happier when things were tidy and organised. He in turn was noticing how beautiful her green eyes were in contrast to her red hair and enjoying hearing her voice as she chatted. After the dancing had finished those who had not dissapeared off into the garden or to their rooms were sitting around in a loose group discussing their adventures. Joe Hardy one of the American delegates was trying his best to strike up a conversation with Nora Arnold but not having much success due to Jack and Mike being protective and never allowing them any time alone. Freddie Trotteville and Jack Trent were having a lazy argument about who had had the most and best adventures. Julian looked at Dick in amusement at the small numbers of adventures they were both discussing and they both resisted the urge to deflate the boastful Freddie with the actual number of their own experiences.Lucy Ann realised the time and made her excuses to Bob after promising to come and sit with him for the following days events. She reached the room she was sharing with Anne and opened the door. To her surprise Anne was nowhere to be seen. A note attached to her pillow said not to worry and that Anne would let herself in and included a plea not to tell anyone that she wasnt there. Lucy Ann sighed. She almost wished she had stayed down at the party but although she liked Bob they were too similar and he wasnt someone she could foresee a future with so she didnt want to give him the wrong idea. It was nice to have a friend to talk to however especially since Dinah George and Anne seemed to be determined to make the most of the advantages of minimal parental supervision. Freddie and Peggy had gone for a walk in the garden as the party broke up. They had discovered a lot in common and had been enjoying spending time together. They discovered a small summerhouse at the end of the hotel gardens and with a lot of nervous giggling they let themselves in and locked the door. They then became fully occupied in discovering how well they were suited in other ways. For once Freddie was completely uninterested in mystery solving or detection techniques. JuIian Bess and her friend Georgina Fayne were walking together in the garden themselves. Julian absently tried the summerhouse door found it locked and they moved on in the direction of the the river and the hotel boathouse. They were all very interested in watercraft and thought that they ought not to miss the opportunity to check the hotels boats. Anne Kirren was significantly more relaxed than she had been earlier in the day.The following day several bleary eyed young adults gradually made their way over to the conference centre. Peggy and Freddie were openly holding hands and sitting together to Mike and Jack Arnolds surprise They had been so busy protecting Noras virtue they hadnt even thought about Peggys. Freddie was bombarded with questions about his intentions and given to understand most clearly that Peggys brothers meant business if he hurt her. Since he was himself already seriously falling for Peggy and would have been just as protective of Bets or Daisy who werent even his sisters he took it in good part and was eventually able to persuade them that he meant no harm. Freed from her brotherly supervision Nora went to sit with Dinah and George determined to get to know them better. They were surprised but welcoming and the group settled in ready for the days lectures.Young Adventurers Conference 1947Day two9.30 to 10.15 Modern detection techniques and how to use them.

They had a fun journey home and discovered that Nora and Mike were actually at a school nearby to their own. Lucy Ann was pleasantly surprised at how gentle Mike was and how shy. Her only knowledge of him before was the newspaper reports of him being caught and charged and then the rather fierce aspect of him protecting Nora and Peggy from admirers. Mike was trying hard to think of something clever to say but failing miserably. He was just happy to be near Lucy Ann and was himself surprised how modest she was. She had no idea at all how beautiful she was and laughed off any suggestion of her and Bob being an item. Finally the train reached their stop. They said goodbye and went off to their homes. Nora was slightly irritated to still be only on friendly terms with Dinah. Dinah herself was already missing George and was also a little wary about how obviously Nora was throwing herself at her. It was quite flattering though and it would be nice to have a new friend nearby now that George was no longer at school especially one who seemed likely to understand. Mike was in a happy daze clutching a tiny piece of paper with Lucy Anns telephone number and address.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/11835996,All things unsaid,Dinah has often been characterized as rather temperamental what old women like to call incorrigible and modern behind her back but that doesnt mean that shes overreacting. Not at all.Honestly only half of the anxiety shes feeling is due to the train fiasco she thinks as she sets her small suitcase down on a bench nearby. The other half is all LucyAnn and Philips doing for organizing this entire trip in the first place in such a terribly cryptic way.For example if one is to belgin a letter with Oh I have the most wonderful news it should not be followed by But you must hear it from us in person when both said persons are far away. Its shamefully inconsiderate.Then again the picture LucyAnn painted is an entrancing one full of ocean winds and CraggyTops and old adventures like in their childhood. We might camp in the old house again while its still summer and maybe relive the good old days. Wouldnt that be wonderfulWonderful indeed. It would have been wonderful if a sudden rockfall hadnt forced the train to stop and be delayed for a day stranding Dinah hours away from the city and only one station away from CraggyTops. It would have been wonderful also if there were a blasted telephone in CraggyTops so that Dinah might call Philip and LucyAnn.Oh well.The station shes currently in is a mess of people hurrying back and forth and a train is already whistling in the distance which only serves to push the crowd lingering near the tracks towards Dinah who is really really not enjoying how these hols are starting out.Its been nearly four years since all of them lived together with Mother and Bill and its been much too long since shes seen the others. Although thats not to say that she isnt aware of every single detail of their lives LucyAnn is the most dutiful letterwriter Dinah has ever met keeping all four of them connected and even with Jacks last ornithology trip to Australia this time Dinah doubts a letter ever failed to meet him.Philips plans to pursue Veterinary Medicine were postponed some years ago when Mother needed him at home and his stay in the house quickly brought about a chicken pen and a small tribe of goats. Dinah is sure that he has many more creatures than that of course but even Mother probably cant quantify them. Since then Dinah suspects that the continued postponing of Philips study plans has something to do with being only an hour away from where LucyAnn is currently studying to be a schoolteacher but thats another matter.The train rushes screeching into the station and Dinah turns her head away as the wind buffets everything in its way. She really ought to stop sulking in the station and see if theres a possibility to hitch a ride. She did bring trousers so the walk from the main road to CraggyTops itself shant be too horrid if she can only get someone to drive her close enough. There are already people descending from the train someone must be in the same predicament as her and driving in the right directionGripping her suitcase she trudges into the crowd children running past her adults shouting after them. Near the first carriage is a gaggle of complaining people yelling at the conductor. As she looks around her eyes find a tall redhead man with a face full of freckles and at his sideBlow your nose What a noise What a nose Screech.Kiki sees her before Jack does craning her white neck and bobbing her head up and down in excitement. Hallo hallo the parrot shouts drawing alarmed stares from the people around them. How do you do halloDinahIn a second she is being joyfully hugged by Jack. Hes certainly more tanned than the last time she saw him nearly a full year ago Australia does do that to one but his green eyes are just as cheerful as ever as he grins widely down at her. Kiki jumps up and down on his shoulder wings flapping.Oh Kiki Dinah says with a bright smile and her horrid mood vanishes. Its so lovely to see you bothJack looks over her head at the crowd excitedly. How did you know I was here Have you come with Tufty And LucyAnnNo unfortunately. The reality of the situation sinks in again but at least shes with Jack now and somehow it doesnt seem as irritating as it did a few minutes ago. I got here only half an hour ago. Its such good luck that we found each otherWe could hitch a ride Jack says watching the groups of people leaving the platform. Ive just got a rucksack youThats what I was thinking. Dinah lifts her suitcase towards him. Its light Ill manage. Have you just arrived in EnglandThe day before yesterday he replies with a grin. Im still knackered. But I think the prospect of going to CraggyTops has killed any tiredness in meThey make their way through the station building to where cars are milling about. Dinah has never been to this town after all JoJo never wanted to take her in the car anywhere which in hindsight was probably for the best.Jack manages to find a helpful couple with a car soon enough. The elderly man and woman are happy to help them although the man seems rather startled by Kiki. The wife on the other hand wastes no time on patting Dinah in the back and smiling at them brightly as if they are family already.Of course we can take you dear Im afraid there shant be much space up front but if you dont mind being a bit jostled the back of the trucks not bad.Oh we dont mind at all Dinah tells her hastily.Well veer off West a few miles before town but if your CraggyTops is on the coastline I daresay youll be at walking distance the old man says nodding. Theyre loading up our truck now but if you wait here well drive past and get you.With one last pat on the womans part the couple crosses the busy street leaving them behind.Well Ive spent the past year hitchhiking so why stop now Jack grins and sits down on the front steps of the station looking up at her. Hows the city been treating you DinahQuite well Dinah replies joining him on the stairs. Theres something terribly unfair about todays fashion which has all but eliminated trousers for women from the market but that hasnt been stopping her much to the chagrin of her nosy landlady. Oh well whos laughing now At least she can sit on the steps comfortably. Ive been promoted. Im Head of Sales now.Ambition is valued in business and while Mother may have hated her job in the city Dinah thrives in it. She left shortly after Mother started to recover and now shes able to send Mother money rather than the other way around for the first time in her life. Perhaps soon therell even be a chance to pursue other more ambitious dreams.I cant imagine life in the city Jack says pulling her attention back to reality. But then again I dont think Ive lived within a hundred miles of a city for the past three years.Dinah laughs. It will be nice to relax. I loathed CraggyTops when I lived there but I think it shall be lovely for a short while.If its the four of us its always jolly.He says it in an offhanded manner a small smile on his face as he looks towards the busy street but Dinah cant help letting a comment slip. A bit different maybe.Jack meets her gaze. Theres something there a guarded sort of awareness the same kind she can feel in herself. She doesnt know how to approach the subject of Philip and LucyAnn how to put into words what she thinks what she knows is happening or how she feels about it. She doesnt think Jack knows how to do either of those things either. Jack has always been better with birds than with people after all.Theres the rattling of an engine nearby and she looks up to see a blue pickup truck turn the corner struggling to make its way through the crowds of people leaving the station and crossing the street to get to it. Guiltily Dinah is glad of the distraction. Standing up she seizes her suitcase. The truck stops nearly in front of them as a gaggle of someones grandchildren hurries past pushing a pram.Jack says nothing more as they climb into the back of the truck only offering her a helpful hand as she swings her leg inside. There are a few boxes wrapped in paper and plastic but otherwise theres quite a bit of space and it shouldnt be too uncomfortable. Dinah turns to look through the window into the cabin but the sun is behind them and reflected off the window its almost blinding.Well were off to CraggyTops Jack says leaning back against the cabin. Off to the sea and the wind and the wavesOff to CraggyTops Kiki pipes up dipping her head against Jack to avoid the wind ruffling her feathers. Off to CraggyTops and the see and the weasel.Jack laughs and scratches her poll. And the birdsDinah smiles. Off to CraggyTops indeed. As the truck leaves the crowded station and sets off towards the countryside she raises her face to the sky and can already smell the sea..When Dinah wakes up the sun is gone. The air has chilled and shadows have fallen over the back of the truck. For a moment she fears that shes somehow slept the day away but then she sees the stone ridges on either side of the road and realizes that theyve just reached the mountains. The sun has sunken into the grey clouds above thats more like the CraggyTops she remembers.Sitting up she looks at Jack. Hes still sitting with his back to the window sleeping and Kikis head is tucked under her wing next to him. His watch reads three p.m. just about forty minutes since Dinah remembers falling asleep which ought to be all right the fork in the road towards CraggyTops must be close ahead.She tightens her jumper around her body. The mountains look taller than she remembers probably because its been years since shes been here. The truck speeds down the highway jostling them a bit more than she had expected and little flashes of green and white crop up between the rock on either side plants and streams surviving even in the salty wind.Theres a particularly violent jolt as the street curves and Jack starts awake looking around sleepily. He meets her gaze and then closes his eyes again. But the street isnt supposed to curve here Dinah realizes suddenly.She turns to look through the window at the elderly couple. With the sun hidden its finally easy to see through. The man is staring straight ahead and beside him are a few more boxes. And... the old woman is not there.A sudden jolt of alarm runs through her. When she looks at the driver again she realizes it isnt the elderly man at all.Heart pounding she reaches towards Jack and shakes him awake. Kiki squawks upset at the interruption but Jack blinks blearily at her.Jack I think were on the wrong truck.He pushes himself up so hes sitting straight rubbing his face. WhatI think were on the wrong truck.That thats not possible he says brow furrowed. He turns to look through the window. We oh.They stare at each other blankly for a moment. Kiki cocks her head and stares at them too. Then the car swerves suddenly with a screech of wheels and Dinah finds herself clutching Jacks arm as they fall sideways in the cargo bed.I dont think were in the right part of the mountains either Dinah breathes nearly lying on the floor of the truck Jack barely clinging to one of the walls in front of the window. How could they have been mistaken The truck stoppedBut not for them she realizes with a jolt of horror. There were many people on the street in front of the station so many that cars had to stop many times to allow them to pass. And with the racket of it all the driver likely didnt even notice two strangers climbing into his truck.Dinah Jack says his tone tense. We need to get off this truck.Dinah follows his line of sight and sees what Jack is seeing the driver taking a swig from a bottle that is most definitely liquor. The truck swerves again curving on the straight road and Dinah looks around desperately. There are no signs of nearby inhabitants although the once steep walls of the cliffs have evened out somewhat shadowy paths winding through them clusters of greylooking grass cropping out here and there through veils of mist. There might be paths there although the cliffs give her no idea of how close or far they are to anything familiar.I dont believe hell be stopping anytime soon Dinah tells Jack. Well have to alert him.Theres no other choice. Jack reaches forward and raps on the window once twice three times.The mans head turns suddenly blotchy face and reddened eyes meeting theirs. And he lets out a scream.For a moment the car turns so precariously that Dinah is sure they are going to crash into the rock but then they pull up abruptly and are pressed against the window breathing heavily hearts pounding. The man leaves the engine running but jumps out of the cab and when Dinah manages to peel herself off of the window she realizes that the man is holding a knife.Its a long sharp knife and the way hes holding it makes it clear that he sees them as a threat. That combined with his reddened eyes and stumbling gait make it clear that hes too far gone for any hope of civilized conversation. Spluttering curses he reaches over the truck towards them.Dinah reels back snatching her suitcase from the corner. Behind her Jack fumbles with his rucksack and Kiki is screeching circling overhead and swooping down towards the driver. The knife glints as he stabs at the air.Kiki Jack yells and the parrot flies towards him. Dinah is already climbing down from the truck alongside him the suitcase dragging behind her.He grasps her arm and they run towards the shadowy misty paths between the rocky walls of the mountains. Behind them the driver yells obscenities stumbling after them.Kiki yells them right back..Everything is covered in mist when they finally look around. Walls of rock are all around them and Dinah suddenly feels smaller than she ever did in the city. Even Kikis poll is flat against her head. But when Jack looks at Dinah its with a kind of gleam in his eye that she hasnt seen in a very very long time.I dont know where we are he says but his eyes are fixed on hers intently.Wordlessly Dinah kicks off the shoes from her feet and as he watches opens her suitcase and pulls out her worn walking shoes. Theyre cracked around the layers laces frayed into an ugly brown but she matteroffactly puts them on and when she straightens again Jack is grinning.I suppose were on an adventure then she says and grabbing his arm pulls him along to where the cliffs level out into something climbable..By the time theyve finally found their path out of the hollow of the cliffs and are ascending to the top theyve found a comfortable way to attach Dinahs suitcase to a length of rope that Jack mysteriously has in his pack so that she can carry it on her back. It looks awkward but feels more comfortable than getting blisters on her hands from carrying it and anyway she needs both hands to climb properly.We need higher ground Kiki Jack calls out to the parrot as she soars above them cutting through the mist. Tell us what you seeKiki squawks from above faintly. Wipe your feeeeeetDinah looks up at the grey sky. It isnt cold not with their walking but she really hopes the mist will clear somewhat as the day progresses or the dark will bring truly terrible conditions. Do you think weve got the direction rightWell its been a while since weve been in these parts Jack says looking around pointlessly. I dont think well know until we can actually see where the coast is.The station shouldnt have been more than an hour away Dinah muses as Kiki swoops back down and perches on a rock just ahead of them gnawing on a pebble. By car that is. If we were going in the wrong direction for forty minutesThere is some advantage to being on foot. The mountains get in the way of the roads anyway and we did our fair share of exploring around these parts. Jack sits down on a rock and setting his rucksack on the floor. He pulls out a water bottle. I imagine that once we can see where we are in relation to the coastline we should be able to find our way. WaterShe takes it from him gratefully. She emptied her own bottle in the train a fact she now bitterly regrets. There are sandwiches in her handbag though shed intended to eat during her trip but had never gotten to doing so. Shell save them for later in these situations food is precious. Tufty and LucyAnn probably would have come eventually Jack says rather remorsefully putting the bottle away once theyve both drunk from it. It might have been better to wait at the station.Who knows with Philip Dinah says with a roll of her eyes although she doesnt really mean it. Hes always too busy with animals to think of humans.Im sure LucyAnn will keep him on his toes Jack says.Dinah doesnt know what to say to that. Its not something shes prepared to talk about really not something she knows how to talk about. She prefers to think of Philip and LucyAnn as something happening in a vacuum separate from the reality of the four of them having adventures together or of her and Jack wandering the cliffs alone.It was easier to do in the city far away.She finally musters the strength to look up but Jack is already looking elsewhere. She wonders if he is feeling at all like she is. If the prospect of finally arriving at CraggyTops brings him just as much dread as it does joy.DinahJack is looking upwards his voice almost a whisper. There are birds perched in patches of discolored grass overhead too far for Dinah to make out but Jack clearly recognizes them. In a second hes pulled out his camera.Razorbills. Theyre nesting.Letting go of the whirlwind in her mind Dinah walks over to where Jack is standing. The birds are lovely small and black with white bellies and legs. They seem to stare at them suspiciously from the crevices above.They only lay one egg each year Jack says quietly eyes glued to the binoculars. Kiki sits quietly on his shoulder accustomed to his birdwatching by now. They come in pairs see here comes the other one now. Mates for life. Gosh I havent seen them in years. Ive been away for too long.No razorbills in AustraliaNo he lets out a low laugh. Not at all..A lot has happened to Jack in Australia she learns and yet nothing at all. While he can tell her all about bird species and the rarities of the continents flora and fauna he mentions very few people by name and from the way he clambers up the rock to catch a closer glimpse of the birds nestled above Dinah knows that hes still the same Jack who used to live with them in the cottage for all those years before they all left home.I prefer birds she tells him hands in her pockets as he clambers down dusting the dirt from the palms of his hands. He cocks his head at her much like Kiki who is currently pecking at something she found in a patch of grass.PardonDinah shakes her head. It was more of the end of a thought than a sentence she meant to speak out loud. I prefer birds to say mammals she explains. Ive never been put off by them the way I am with Philips animals. I suppose its because theyre less crawly.Jack laughs almost evilly. Think of how many crawly ones must live in CraggyTops now.She makes a face at him.Ahead the rock grows steeper and suddenly climbing is no longer a leisurely activity more something that involves strategically hauling their luggage onto jutting rocks and pulling themselves up after it. Dinah goes first ignoring the dirt that digs under the fingernails she once kept neat for work feeling her trousers scrape against sharp edges as she scrambles onto flat ground above. The mountain seems to go on forever. If only the mist saw fit to recede somewhat they might know where they are.Youre fast for someone who hasnt been climbing in a while Jack says infuriatingly less out of breath than she is as he alights on flat ground but he looks rather impressed. I suppose its the hotheadedness from the business world. I always thought youd do well in a role like that.He takes the lead in the next climb throwing his rucksack ahead of him and then doing the same with her suitcase but it takes Dinah a moment to move after him. An odd chill has settled over her bones.A role like whatShe tries to make it sound nonchalant but it isnt a nonchalant question at all.From above Jack cant see her face. Where you get to speak your mind he says and then teasingly Tell people what to do and use your authority.Funny she says rather coldly. Hes teasing she knows but she cant help it. Youre not the first one to say that. It seems that all anyone focuses on is how mean they think Ill be.Jack laughs oblivious. Youre just intimidating Dinah.Dinah stops fumbling with the rocks and straightens back taut like a bow. Well maybe I dont want to be intimidating she snaps glaring up at him. Her heart is pounding. Maybe Im sick of receiving such awful backhanded compliments as if I ought to be thankful for them.Jack turns to stare at her with wide eyes. Dinah I didntForget it Dinah says sourly returning to the task at hand kicking at pebbles that go crashing down. I dont care.DinahI said forget it.She hates this. She hates it. As they climb up the last of the cliff Dinah cant even muster the strength to look at him although she can see from the corner of her eye that hes slowed his pace and waited for her to catch up with him so that they can reach the top together. She hates that this is always how it ends either with a man so furious he calls her a bitch or men like Jack too respectful too hollowly kind to even begin to try to understand.She hates that hearing those words from Jack makes her feel so hurt.Through the mist the sky darkens and soon what seemed like a fun labyrinth turns into a more sinister maze of rocky pathways each one leading to a more frightening shadowy death. Somewhere behind the grey the sun turns red as they reach the top of the cliff but theres nothing to be seen only muted shadows beyond a thick veil of mist.From somewhere in the wilderness below however Dinah can feel the forceful push of ocean wind. The tide must be going down by now she thinks. The waves are pulling back from CraggyTops and the cavernous mysteries beneath it. Its strange not to be able to see it.She wonders what Philip and LucyAnn are doing and then banishes the thought. Behind her Jack squints apparently equally frustrated. His brow is still furrowed from their earlier argument and Dinah feels a splintered sort of feeling that she isnt entirely comfortable with.I dont suppose well make it out of here before dark she says her tone clipped.Jack seems to have come to the same conclusion. He walks over to where his things are and extracts a woolen sweater. He tosses it at her.Dinah catches it. Its worn and frayed likely from years of use.Pillow Jack says simply and sets out to find the softest patch of scraggly grass on the clifftop. He has a torch she can see a little white halo of light moving about the solid shadow of the mountain in front of him not quite reaching the depths of its crevices.Dinah shivers. Kiki is perched stiffly on Jacks shoulder and hasnt said a word perhaps sensing the tense atmosphere. She keeps cocking her head at Dinah accusingly which only serves to irritate her.Clutching Jacks sweater tightly in one hand Dinah sits on the cold rock and opens her suitcase. Theres a little water left which they should drink before sleeping but not much to eat. Ignoring the hunger in her stomach she settles for pulling out a blanket and a few of her rolled up clothes. She ought to be wishing she were in CraggyTops right now around a warm fire but not even the hunger is enough to dispel the tension from her mind.Shes always been the most insecure out of all of them she feels. Philip has always had this innate sense of selfworth and Jack has always been too focused on birds to care about what anyone else thinks. LucyAnn is too compassionate to ever spare a thought for her own flaws. But Dinah Dinah generates anxieties for all four of them sometimes grinds them into her teeth and keeps them there secret until they make her head hurt and her eyes sting.This isnt right.She whips her head around to see Jack standing nearby. His arms are crossed in front of him but hes looking away like he cant quite meet her eyes.She raises an eyebrow. WhatThis isnt right. You and I we dont have rows Dinah. His voice is low and tense but not angry. It makes his words cut right through her. You know who I am you know what I mean when I say things. You know I dont mean it like like whoever else meant it.Dinah digs her fingers into the sweater and when the words escape her they dont quite tremble. Do I intimidate youHe pauses his eyes glued to hers. No he says finally and his mouth quirks slightly at a corner. But I expect the Queen wouldnt intimidate me if Id known her for as long as Ive known you.She allows herself a weak smile. Its dusk now and the clouds make only his eyes gleam his face pale. She thinks oddly that she cant see his freckles anymore.Most people think Im coldhearted she says. I dont want you to think that.I dont. I never have.And hes telling the truth she knows when he reaches out and touches her arm lightly as he passes her just a brush of his palm against her forearm like he does with Kiki sometimes when its been a while since the parrot has spoken and he wants her to know that he hasnt forgotten her. Its a small gesture but Dinah feels something in her heart constrict nonetheless.As he continues looking for a place to settle down for the night she presses the worn sweater to her cheek tentatively but it doesnt feel unfamiliar. Its as if this has been her pillow all along.,Mature,Friends to LoversEveryone's all grown up nowReally Dinah/Jack but some background Philip/Lucy-AnnFeminist!DinahDinah's POV
https://archiveofourown.org/works/47921542,The Kagari Twins Are NOT Allowed To Time Travel Without Permission,The Great Sorcerer Zed Kagari and his husband High Cleric Micah Kagari got married on a warm winters day. Which sounds weird but actually Zed just used some magic so that it was warm outside. They were 28 years old when it happened and were covered in many more scars than when they started dating mental and physical. Theyd broken up a few times but gotten back together in the end theyd become more powerful and respected and Frond and Dame Liza basically argued the King into letting them marry. Jaynas present to them was a spell she had found in the Forbidden Libraries of the Silverglow Tower forbidden for containing spells that helped violate the natural order of the world. This specific spell would allow them to use magic to combine their DNA to create artificial babies from two people of the same body who could not naturally have a baby together. While they would need to find someone with the proper body parts to carry the baby it would not carry much biological relation to said baby though it did mentioned hat if said carrier was of a different species then one or both parents then the baby would carry that species DNA in them though it might not show up super obviously. The Ranger Felsage had enthusiastically offered herself up for this saying it sounded fun. She had carried a pair of twins named Astoria and Cain. They were both about two thirds elf part droshea part light elf and part human. Astoria while taking after Zed physically took after Micah in terms of ability. Cain was the opposite taking after Micah physically but Zed ability wise. Around the same time the rest of their friend group were having babies all only a couple months or even weeks apart. The kids grew up in the Adventurers Guild being taken on Quests when it was deemed safe enough learning about how to kill each different type of Danger at the same time they learned how to read. The two things might have been related. All in all their life was perfect. Until it wasnt because the problems started just a few weeks before the Guildculling all the kids would be going through Astoria walked into her twin brothers lab with a feeling of complete boredom. Cain spent a lot of time in Silverglow Tower practicing his magic. Everyone knew he would get into the Silverglows just like everyone knew he would leave the Silverglows to join the Adventurers Guild or at least spend most of his time at the Guildhall. Their parents were two of the most powerful people on the planet after all. Astoria preferred to spend her time in the temple practicing her anima with their father to learning magic with their dad. What are you working on She asked Cain leaning over his shoulder to look at the runes he was drawing. Some spell I saw in one of the elven spell books. The ones from Queen MeShala. Cain took after their father physically having olive skin brown eyes and he looked like a noble like he was supposed to be from the Guerra house. However when it came to talents he was a very powerful sorcerer like their dad. Mmm. Astoria nodded. She took after their dad physically with fawn skin and dark brown curls in her hair. However when it came to her talents she was skilled with her anima a prodigy just like their father. Whats it do she asked as she leaned over noting the dark circles under his eyes. She reached over and pressed her thumbs to the circles and her hands glowed the familiar gold of anima as she healed them. Dadll be upset if you come home like that. I dont know what it does and Im fine Ill sleep when I finish. Sure you will. Astoria leaned over and picked up some sleeping scent candles setting them out. She waved her hands again starting out on the motions to start the spell to light them. She might not have been as powerful as Dad or Cain but she was still powerful. Fie no Astoria dont light a fire said Cain running over but it was too late the candles had been lit and sigil on the floor burst into flames. Astoria stared at it and Cain did as well. Fie. said Astoria as the pull of the sigil became too strong and she and Cain stumbled through it and into the swirling vortex on the other side of the flames. When she looked up she saw she was in the Sea of Stars Guildhall but it was older. Like she was seeing a snapshot of the past. A fact that was highlighted by the statue in the corridor of her Uncle Nirav and the fact that her Uncle Brock Aunt Liza Uncle Jett and Dad were all standing there looking at them in confusion. We are so grounded when we get back home said Cain after a moment of awkward silence. Oh absolutely. said Astoria faintly a look of horror on her face. Cain would appreciate it if it was noted that he let them tie him up. If he wanted he could easily get out of the bindings or not have been bound in the first place. How did he know that That was one of the things he had to do on a regular basis. Sometimes he would wake up tied to a chair and he would have to escape. Sometimes it was a surprise. Point is compared to normally he was well informed. However considering the climate he was in he figured it was simply easier to let them do what they wanted and hed figured the rest out later. Who are you asked Frond holding a dagger beneath their chins tilting Astorias face up. Cain was very unsettled seeing the look he usually saw directed toward Dangers directed toward her sister. Especially since Frond was basically like his friend groups Grandma. Not biologically or legally but emotionally which is basically the same thing. Astoria daughter of the Great Sorcerer and the High Cleric. This is my twin brother Cain. We are 13 years old and we will go through our Guildculling in 4 weeks. She said this all with a level of calmness that only comes from a lifetime of being randomly pulled into life threatening situations. We arent comfortable sharing our last names. said Cain glancing at Astoria glad they were on the same wavelength. Not yet anyway. I was testing out an unmarked spell it activated and now were here. He slid his hands slightly against each other getting out of the ropes binding them. Okay what intentions do you have Not bad ones. said Astoria. We mean no harm except to Dangers and our enemies. But no one here. Except for one person but were totally justified and we wont hurt her. Cain nodded in agreement glaring slightly at Lotte. Everyone knew what she was and what she had done. He would never forgive her for hurting his family. Fine. Untie them. No need. Cain said standing up Astoria standing with him at the same time the ropes falling down around them and the chair. Were good. Cain looked around frowning. We should probably find somewhere to sleep. he said slipping into droshean knowing no one here would know it. The attic wont be set up for us. Fie we do dont we.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/47650684,Player‚Äôs Manual,Brock was not the perfect adventurer. This wasnt news to anyone. Liza was the perfect adventurer. Zed wasnt perfect but he sure as Fie came close. Even Micah was a better adventurer. Brock on the other hand was more suited for the covert operations of being a spy and a thief. He didnt go around stealing things willynilly. He wasnt stupid. He was practiced. He was good at what he did. It was why he was a member of the Shadow Guild for so long. Brock asked Zed opening the door and walking into his room. Hey I wanted to ask he trailed off when he saw Brock sitting down and staring off into the distance. You okay he asked tilting his head. Yeah. Brock shook his head and looked at Zed. Yeah sorry. Whats up Its nothing. Its just Im not sure about everything. Zed waved his hand around a little bit. I mean I didnt really het the chance to think about it before because the fate of Freestone was like constantly at stake. But like am I really cut out for this whole adventure thing Brock rolled his eyes and flopped down beside Zed. Of course youd be worried about that. Zed you are the best sorcerer Ive ever seen. I mean I havent seen many but still. Callum believes in you and so do Frond and Micah. Hexam and Jayna are also here to support you every step of the way. Plus you have me. Im the support role after all. Always there to support and uplift you and your power. True. Zed chewed his lip a little. You dont hate me right Even though I almost killed everyone. Zed asked that question basically twice a day now. Like he was worried Brock would change his mind. As if. Never. Brock pressed a kiss to the crown of Zeds head and ruffled his hair. Now go mess around with your boyfriend or something. The tips of Zeds ears turned their trademark embarrassed red. Hes not my boyfriend. We havent made it official yet. Brock laughed. Better get a move on then. He smiled after Zed as he left the room face aflame. He knew it wasnt his place to feel left behind by Zed. Zed spent years being harassed left behind and so many worse things. Brock was just being selfish. He just sometimes wished that he could keep up. He sighed and then turned around to sit down. It was getting late so he was going to have to get ready for bed. He got up and shrugged out of his tubic changing into a loose pair of pants and then laying in bed. He needed to formulate a plan for tomorrows mission. Suddenly a shadow flashed past the window. The window that led straight out of the wall. Brock frowned suspiciously. He didnt know anyone who could be outside the wall after dark like this. He pulled on his shirt and leaned out to see. He saw a tall figure walking into the forest looking around to check if he was being watched. Brock frowned and grabbed his dagger. He jumped out the window and braced himself to fall rolling when he hit the ground. At least he was good at something. He jumped up and then ran into the spot in the forest where the fogure had vaboshed into. The figure had a long curly tail and large wings so he had no doubt it was a Danger of some kind but it also looked humanoid walking on two legs having four normal limbs other than the wings and having long curly hair. He wondered what he would do with the body. If it was sentient he would burn it on a pyre and do the customary burial prayers. If it wasnt well he would bring it back to Hexam for examination and endure whatever lecture Frond saw fit. He walked furthur into the forest holding up his knife when he heard a scratchy humming as if the persons throat had been ripped up or something. Hello He asked hesitantly as he looked over for who could be out here. He saw a figure race over. Who are you asked the angey voice. Now that he was closer Brock could see that the winged figure was a strange kind of human. He had sharp teeth and bat wings. He had a tail lashing behind him and his eyes glowed other then that though he had a humanoid awareness in his eyes and his long curly hair was toed back. He had scars covering his body including his beck and face. He was wearing a torn and resewn blackandwhite shirt with Hellfire Club written on it with a strange demonic insignia branded on it. Who are you asked the boy though his accent was strange. Though to be fair that might have been because of the intense scarring on his throat. Brock Dunderfel Adventurer one of the Saviors of Freestone. Brock said holding up his hands as he felt a circular piece of metal press into his temple Freestone The boy tilted his head but didnt move otherwise. The city over there. Brock raised one hand silently applauding himself for not shaking and pointed. Im a member of the Sea of Stars the Adventurers who hunt Dangers beyond the walls. Dangers This seemed to confused the boy becausr the circle of metal dropped and the boy tossed it behind him into a clearing casually. What are those The monsters Brock said in confusion gesturing. Like the Undead the Mindflayer etc. Oh like the monsters. the boy muttered. He looked thoughtful hearing the names. They have mostly avoided me since I arrived he said calmly. I woke up with this cool new vampireesque body and everyones just kind of ignored me since. He shrugged. Where did you get those scars Asked Brock. Defending my city. Hawkins. There was a man no a monster now. He sighed. He was controlling everyone. Almost killed one of their friends Max and did kill a bunch of others like Chrissy. He killed Chrissy in front of me. I was blamed for her murder. I went on the run and ended up joining the group that had been fighting this guy. I died. Damn. That really sucks. Brock said patting the boys shoulder awkwardly. My dad did blackmail me into joining the adventurers guild to be a supercool spy but Ive never died. Also whats a vampire. Well Im a vampire. Mostly. Most vampires look different from me in literature. I drink blood to survive instead of eating food Im nocturnal. Luckily I dont die in sunlight like some stories say Im just significantly more tired and much weaker during daylight. You drink blood Brock asked in surprise. The boy didnt look like he was spending time cutting people open and draining them. Thats so creepy. Well it definitely wont help with the murder allegations. So what are you doing here Brock asked after a moment. He had his hand on the knife so he wasnt sure why he wasnt moving to kill this guy danger whatever immediately. I kind of claimed that clearing as a little headquarters for me. he explained with a shrug. I was working on a campaign. Campaign Yeah. Its from a game called DnD. I guess you dont have it in this universe. I can show you the players manual if you want so you can understand better. Yeah okay I can do that. Brock nodded.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/41433543,"Body,Bone and Mind",A man moved through the shadowed alleys and streets to avoid being seen by less than forgiving eyes. Everything felt heavy inside him hunger and exhaustion sapping every ounce of his being from him and making the wanderer dizzy as thunder clouds overhead threatened to downpour any second. I must keep moving... So weak... Wait...laughter...children...must go..no...must..keep..going...to ...wHerE... Rodney Skinner laughed as he kicked a can with some local children fond memories of a time long gone filling him with nostalgia and joy the little ones undisturbed by the selfproclaimed gentleman thiefs pallor and need for dark glasses over his eyes only caring for a more oversized playmate with the same energy as them.He would need to get back to the League Germanic HQ before it started to rain and wash away his makeup but he was having so much fun he hardly put much thought into this action.Somehow their benefactor had managed to set up several HQs on land for the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen to use all across the globe at their leisure a fact Nemo had very nearly taken as a severe insult when the man had first presented one to them back in Scotland.The fact that Mycroft Holmes had stained one of the Captains handwoven carpets earlier that same day from a bout of seasickness might have helped with Nemos disagreeable mood towards him. However the Captain thankfully did not do more than glare and try to defend his beloved ship.Skinner saw something out of the corner of his eye that made his skin chill over and forced him to look. Hey what is that A woman She looked sick. Rodney walked over and saw that the person was very illlooking indeed clothing pretty much rags and about five sizes too largehair long matted and to make matters direr sported a rather large stomach which seemed far too much for their petite frame. Hey mate are you alright Skinner asked before lunging forward with a cry of surprise to catch the figure when they nearly collapsed in the street.Ba...ba... The figure which the voice appointed now as male rasped out before fainting completely in the gentleman thiefs arms.Hang on I got some friends who may be able to help Skinner said obviously more to himself than to the man who was in the realm of dreams now.Managing to scoop them into his arms careful of not jostling the frail man too much and wishing the children a quick goodbye he jogged back to the HQ where Mina was trying to take some plants inside as the weather was turning off colder than a witchs heart.The vampiresss eyes widened almost comically as she saw this display and ran over gently running her fingers through black with shockingly white streaks through its hair her sensitive nose picking up on several things about the person in Skinners arms. two hearts beating at once severe exposure strange energy What happened Mina asked already moving to take the man from Skinner but the invisible man held tight to his cargo.No idea luv but hes in a bad way Rodney said knowing he should just hand the other over but was too stiff to do so correctly and feared he would wind up dropping his delicate load entirely.The two league members went inside just as it started to piss rain outside and ran to the infirmary which was mercifully fully stocked with medical supplies and beds one of which was quickly filled with the impromptu guest.Roshan the ships regular doctor rushed over to tend to the new arrival mildly waving Skinner away from the bed who glared not that the other could see it at being so callously dismissed.Assistants helped Roshan to strip their patient from his torn clothing and shoes all of which almost fell to pieces in the crew members hands nothing holding the materials together but threads and a prayer. Skinner watched off to the side as Mina joined the group in preparing IVs and wrappings for the poor mans feet and examined the bump which was now even more prominent that it was not hidden by inadequate fitting clothing. Blisters on soles of feet severely malnourished dehydrated and fetal weight is small for estimated gestation time of the second trimester one of the crew listed off from their notepad. Body shows signs of multiple surgeries of both gentle area and stomach unknown if this will allow for a safe vaginal birth or if cesarean will be required. Thank you Shivani we will make the preparations for a Csection unless the parent wishes to try otherwise and will monitor for further complications Roshan said as he gently covered the still unconscious man with a blanket after he had redressed him in a clean nightgown.What do you think happened to him Skinner asked Mina as she made her way back over to the invisible man who had settled himself next to one of the sinks.I have no clues it seems his body has been through a lot though best to get some food in him and help him strengthen up before we start asking any invasive questions Mina said as she washed her hands.Guess this means Ill be letting the others know we have a dinner guest tonight Skinner tried to joke but it held no actual amusement behind it only pity.Good Ill stay with him and perhaps we could bring dinner in here he can meet all of us and perhaps one of the others will be able to pick up on more from him Mina said not even looking up from her task though the look on her face showed she was deeply in thought.With a nod and spin of his trenchcoat Skinner went down the hall to collect his other friends.,Teen And Up Audiences,Other Ships Not Mentioned in TagsTags Contain SpoilersMpregMale PregnancyUnhealthy RelationshipsTeam as FamilyFamily DramaBaby OC - FreeformVampire OCDoctor OC - FreeformThe league have no idea what they got roped intoTom Sawyer is a cinnamon rollSkinner is a GENTLEMAN thiefJekyll is done with everyone's shitCaptain Nemo is done with everyone's shitMina Harker is done with everyone's shitDealsScience ExperimentsHuman ExperimentationMedical ExperimentationUnethical ExperimentationMedical ProceduresMedical InaccuraciesPropositionsMusical ReferencesChildbirthBlood and InjuryBlood DrinkingAttempted MurderDracula is a titlenot just one vampireArranged MarriageAlternate Universe - MagicNemo has emotionsTom is the family babyNemo does not like your gifts MycroftProtective SiblingsConspiracyMagical PregnancyBlackmailThreats of ViolenceThreatsDisturbing ThemesCharacter Turned Into VampireVampire TurningWeird BiologyNight TerrorsNightmaresNemo does NOT suck as a parentJekyll knows nothing about birthing babiesRape/Non-con ElementsNo actual rape just people get handsykeep your hands to yourselfAmbiguous/Open Ending
https://archiveofourown.org/works/42178203,Mr Roberts' Reading Rooms,Prologue Wedged in amongst the gray office blocks and shopfronts lies a quaint three storey red brick building. If we were to climb the eight elaborately tiled steps and stand upon the landing before the carved double doors we would find the commemorative stone laid by Alexander Roberts Esq when the building was first commenced so long ago. The ornate windows the elaborate portico and the imposing columns suggest this was once a home to a family of some importance. Now as announced by the tarnished bronze shingle it is home to Roberts Reading Rooms.Long ago in a slower gentler time this building was a haven away from the dust of the streets and the rattle of carts. Gentlemen and ladies would enter leaving their parasols and top hats in the entry hall before immersing themselves in tea news and gossip. Depending on the time of day gentlemen may have chosen to indulge themselves by smoking a cigar and partaking of a glass of brandy before turning to the latest shipping crisis or political scandal within the page of The Times or other such broadsheet. Ladies on the other hand would rush to the parlour eager to read of the latest fashions from Paris and the news from across the seas.The tinkle of china cups on saucers the low hum of whispered conversation and the crisp turning of pages was the steady background rhythm of these rooms. On the brisk cold days of winter deep leather armchairs and roaring fires invited patrons to take a book from the shelves and settle in for the afternoon. Spring sunshine saw the balcony welcome lively debate from the ladies book clubs.Somehow the newly formed blossoms and gentle breezes always lent an air of romance to the story under discussion. Gradually the world outside these Rooms began to change. Electric tramcars dingdinged their way along the streets people walked faster scurrying from here to there like so many busy ants children ran through the crowds squealing and shouting to each other. Inside Roberts Reading Rooms however the firs continued to crackle in the fireplaces and the china continued to tinkle. The news must still be read. Stories would continue to be shared.There was first one war and then another. Ladies sighed with relief upon reading of the safe return of the HMAS Marlborough and celebrated with a cup of tea. Fathers toasted their sons bravery then considered penning their own memoirs of courage under fire after reading how Captain Brown shot down the Red Barron. Motor cars may pollute the streets outside but the news must still be read and stories would still be shared.The world wars ended cars because faster dresses became shorter. Boxes with talking pictures invaded living rooms. The news must still be read every night at 6 Oclock to the waiting family with T.V. dinners. Stories would be shared by Hollywood and its celebrities. Dust began to gather in the unused portions of Roberts Reading Rooms.By the time of the internet and the World Wide Web Roberts Reading Rooms were forgotten by all but a few. Old Mr Roberts still opened his doors he believed that news needed to be read and that stories needed to be shared. However the grandeur of the old days had faded and the Reading Rooms had taken on the air of a neighbourhood house inhabited by the disenfranchised and the lonely with nowhere else to go. Tea was still available although the tinkle of china had been replaced by the clunk of mismatched mugs. Saucers occasionally held some almostoutofdate biscuits or cake.And while still comforting to watch the old fire didnt give off enough heat to banish the rising damp and mildew. All in all Roberts Reading Rooms appeared to be a relic of the past outliving their purpose and no longer needed in the twentyfirst century. We all know of course that appearances can be deceptive.,Not Rated,LiteratureYA LiteratureFantasyAlternate Realitystories
https://archiveofourown.org/works/38834205,Shattered Seashells,The Nautilus was above the oceans surface so she could absorb what she needed from the sun before her captain sent his beloved ship beneath the safety of the waves once again along with her loyal crew.The crew and the league took advantage of the day to go onto shore for personal items or even just to enjoy a stroll on a surface that didnt move. However the captain of said ship chose to stay on his vessel. Nothing on land interested him at that particular moment. Nemo was mildly examining a seashell that Skinner had gifted him with after the man had broken the trunk off his Ganesha statue during an intoxicated state and well the sea captain was still very irritated with the selfproclaimed gentleman thief the figure was fixable and the shell did prove to be a rather lovely apology gift.The seashell had rainbow swirls around the top before fading into a dark blue near where the old occupant of the exoskeleton would have popped out of before it found a new home or grew another one. Wonder what species had called this shell home It was like no other shell he had seen perhaps a yetundiscovered crab An exciting prospect for sure. There was something new to uncover and all from their resident invisible man finding a seashell. A mild chuckle came from Nemos throat as he thought of Skinner of all people discovering a new creature of the sea such a boost to the ego would undoubtedly leave the man almost intolerable for weeks to come.A sudden sound made Nemo drop the shell to the ground where it cracked but didnt break and the captain felt a minor wave of disappointment and annoyance at his clumsiness with his friends gift before registering what had caused it. That was a screamAnd a familiar one at that Nemo bit back a groan as he prepared to deal with the problem.The day had started out so peacefully but such things never seemed to last for long around here. Suppose someone else got a bit of cabin fever and wanted to enjoy the morning with the rest of them. The captain ran as fast as his legs would allow to the source of the bloodcurdling noise as it echoed and this nearly caused him to trip over said cause barely catching himself on a nearby railing to avoid falling wincing a bit as the muscles in his arm were pulled harshly at this action. Still it went to the back of his mind as he observed his friend.Doctor Jekyll was on his back eyes blown wide but unseeing as his limbs contorted screaming even louder as if he was being murdered. Nemo knew if he were transforming there would be no stopping it but the moment Mr. Hyde appeared he was getting the full force of the captains wrath at peace being disturbed. But after a few seconds of no change in appearance and flecks of red splattering onto the walls proved nothing of that sort was happening and what was was arguably worse in the circumstances.Blood coated Henrys hands from what appeared to be broken glass if the shattered mirror out of the corner of Nemos eye was anything to go by a few large shards visible in the wounds. The Doctor kept thrashing around his screams now hoarse and the Indian could only briefly wonder why he was the only one who had been alerted by the cries.Everyone could not be gone into the town other than himself and Jekyll could they Or did they also guess the problem and not wish to deal with the brute and promptly make themselves scarceMore blood splashed to the floor as the glass shards embedded themselves into more of the Doctors body.Nemo was on him in a blink. The ordinarily stoic Indians face contorted in his efforts to turn the other man onto his stomach to prevent his friends apparent seizure from doing any more damage to himself pushing against the other body hard to slide him away from the majority of the glass and Nemo grunted as a sharp sting went across his face as a serrated piece of glass from Jekylls wounds found itself dragged across the captains flesh.The wound bled fast but Nemo was grateful it had not been something more vital that had been sliced open and lower a swing and the thing cut would have been his throat.Pinning the Doctors body using his own weight was easier said than done as more glass shuffled around despite the Indians attempts more seemed to fall from nowhere and Nemo was grateful for his thick clothing preventing more cuts to his person as he tried to figure out how to reach help since it seemed everyone was out of earshot. However he could not just wait to be stumbled upon by one of the league.The captain would be unable to carry Henry by himself the Doctor was not a heavy man despite all the cooks attempts to stuff him like a goose but he was taller which would prove tedious to try and figure out how to carry him in a way without risking further injury to them both and even if Jekyll was closer to Nemo in height thrashing about with glass in his body was still a risk Nemo did not want to take.Thinking fast Nemo used the belt of his coat to tie the Doctors hands together the skin of the other cold and clammy under his hold glass stinging his own hands in the process of looping the rest around a handrail to act as an anchor hoping the makeshift restraint would hold till the captain could fetch more help and perhaps keep the glass from doing any more harm to Jekyll or others.Now to find help then to figure this mess out where was everyone Miss Harker would be preferable for her medical skills but he would have taken Quatermain if just for the extra hands.A highpitched whistle came from the direction of the kitchen before it went silent again.Nemo wasted no time bolting for the dining area door throwing open the sliding bypass in his way about to shout he needed assistance and almost drew back at what he saw standing in front of him.In his bedrobe and hair wet Doctor Jekyll poured tea into a china cup not a speck of blood on him and a contented smile on his face as he picked up the beverage before raising his head to observe the captain.Oh hello Nemo you are just in time care for somewhat is that on your shirt did youyoure bleedingThe delicate teacup uncaringly shattered on the hard floor as Jekyll went into doctor mode rushing over after grabbing a towel to hold to the captains wound gently leading the shocked Nemo over to a chair to sit down of which the man offered no resistance.What happened You look like you have seen a ghost Henry asked putting his hand on Nemos forehead grimacing a bit when he felt that the other man was warmer than he would have liked. You have a mild fever Im going toIm alright. You must come with me its important Nemo responded before standing back up as Jekyll tried to convince him to relax he had another job to do and the captain did not want his friend out of his sight till it was done something was very wrong here.Now Captain sit back doAH With the strength of a much younger man Nemo pulled Henry by his sleeve ignoring the complaints and calls for him to calm down. It all became white noise in his desire to solve this puzzle. They reached the spot in record time and Nemo let Henry take his arm back as he looked around frowning even deeper at the scene or rather its lack of one.Nothing Not a drop of blood or fragment of glass and certainly no thrashing doppelganger of Doctor Jekyll tied to a railing.There was a broken mirror right here and someone was injured Nemo said as calmly as possible no need for the Doctor to think him mad by telling him that the injured man was Henry himself. They were convulsing and had glass in their hands. So thats how you got cut Jekyll said softly a hint of an emotion that Nemo could not place in his voice mind too distracted to pinpoint it another crew member must have found them and put the poor man in the infirmary before cleaning up the glass we need to go there anyway so I can clean that cut on your face before it gets infected and you can check on the crew member. Nemo knew that was impossible but said nothing he needed more evidence before he mentioned anything it only took him a few minutes in the kitchen. He knew no more than five minutes had passed since the incident.Certainly not enough time to drag someone convulsing to the infirmary after untying them no less then coming back to clean up every speck of glass before Nemo had managed to fetch Henry and bring him to the site. But admittedly the infirmary was the best option for finding the doppelganger. Significantly injured as they were perhaps a few of the crew had found them and that explained how quickly it had been cleaned up Nemos staff was efficient. Perhaps the crew member was simply a lookalike And the man was prone to fits And with the right cleaning equipment someone could have made quick work of the glass.It was the only explanation he could reach at the moment.,Mature,Other Additional Tags to Be AddedHow Do I TagTags Are HardTags Contain SpoilersJules Verne is rolling in his graveRobert Louis Stevenson is rolling in his graveFamily DynamicsTeam as FamilyMajor Character InjuryIshmael lives AUBram Stoker is rolling in his graveface it all the authors are rolling in their gravesMysteryMild Hurt/ComfortMild BloodStabbingHallucinationsGaslightingEveryone Needs A HugEveryone Has IssuesCharacter Death In DreamNightmaresNight TerrorsNightmare FuelPoisoningNemo has emotionsMina puts up with no shitSleeptalkingSleepwalkingTom Sawyer is a cinnamon rollJekyll just wanted some teaNemo and Janni have a positive father and daughter relationshipMentioned Sherlock Holmes - FreeformSawyer is a disney princess (animals love him)

https://archiveofourown.org/works/32546833,Long Afloat (On Shipless Oceans),When Tom was five years old his mother had gone away for what he assumed was an indefinite amount of time and Aunt Polly had neatly packed up all of his belongings into boxes his clothes and his toys and the little books with golden spines that Mama read nightly to him in bed. The older he grew the fuzzier the memories became but then there were bits and pieces that could never be done away with even if it did him more bad than good to remember. The way his aunt carried out the boxes into the trunk of her car and the way she carried herself. Her jaw was firmly set and the pace at which she repeatedly walked between the house and the vehicle was fast and methodical. He always remembered that. He didnt really understand any of it. But when he asked where Mama was Aunt Polly told him that she was in heaven now. Then he asked what heaven was and she told him it was a nice place where good sweet people wentlike his mamawhen they died. She said it was normal to miss his mama terribly because of what had happened. He didnt know what exactly had happened or what dying meant even if she had torturously tried to explain it to him countless times within the past few weeks. Heaven was a place where people were safe and happy forever she said. Even though Tom hoped Aunt Polly was wrong and that his mother wasnt in heaven so that she could come back soon he soaked in those very important key words and repeated them in his head like a mantra. Safe. Happy. Forever. The day Tom vanished it was the 6th of December 1973 and a Thursday.Aunt Polly wanted to go Christmas shopping while he Sid and Mary were out of the house and Sid had to stay after school for chess club. Their plans hadnt fallen through because it wasnt until evening that realization took hold and panic began to set in. By dusk Aunt Polly sat like a stone in her lounge chair after having dialed the police eyes swimming with tears she could no longer fight off the presents shed stowed away in her bedroom closet all but forgotten. Sid and Mary crept out from their beds and watched silently from the landing drowning in her bottomless eyes and letting the terrifying reality seep in Their aunt their anchor washed in the faint glow of the lamp had stopped telling herself sweet lies that kisses and punishment alike awaited Tom as soon as he walked through the front door. She had gotten the authorities involved.Many of the mornings details were often lost as the night had turned the days entirety into a blur of much more important details to be remembered so that they could be repeated to a detective Auburn hair and hazel eyes. Caucasian yesHes got lots of freckles too and a birthmark below his left shoulder blade. What he wore He left the house in denim pants and black converse shoes and a uh a plain gray winter coat with a cobalt blue turtleneck sweater underneath. This was when her photographic memory came into use. She knew the exact shade of blue because she loved to knit.The detective scribbled down the jumble of words furiously into his notepad but she talked too fast and anxiously and often he had to ask her to pause and take a deep breath which she resented. The long description was followed by a last quavering remark about what his book bag looked like the contents inside etceteraEven though no one had yet asked. That morning Tom decided on jeans and a thick cobalt blue sweater because it was fairly cold outside but not before making a mess of his room. By the time he was dressed and slipped out the door he had left countless changes of shirts and sweaters and pants strewn about the floor.He snuck down the stairs on tiptoethe stairs in their house creaked ridiculously loudand just as he had predicted and hoped for no one waited at the bottom of the stairs to scold him. He was the first one up. He prepared breakfast and then sat himself down at the dining table to eat. A banana and a piece of toast slathered with butter a glass half full with orange juice. After he finished he placed his dishes in the sink for someone else to wash he planned on wasting no time leaving.As he returned from the mud room with his converse sneakers in hand and his backpack slung over his shoulder he noticed her then. It was difficult not to when she always took up so much space in whatever room she occupied and it had nothing to do with physical size as she was quite a small woman. After a recent growth spurt Tom already threatened to tower over her.She sat in the same chair he had minutes prior peering over the rims of her glasses that sat perfectly on the bridge of her nose and at him as if he were an insect in a jar. Tom hadnt heard her come down the stairs.Going out to see Huck this morning hmGood morning to you too.Aunt Polly chuckled beneath her breath. Wish you would get up this early every morning Tom.He jammed his fists into his pockets and shifted his weight from one socked foot to the other. Too early to get up for no reason.Come sit down with me for a moment Tom.Tom resisted the urge to roll his eyes but obeyed. He placed his shoes by the door and his backpack on the sofa and joined his aunt at the table.She put her hand over his and nodded smiling and satisfied. Then she rose from her chair to fix herself a cup of coffee. She spoke as she took the tin of coffee grounds from the cupbert above the sink and began dumping a spoonful into the filter. Dont you think about skipping school with him today Thomas. Ill find out if you do. Promise me that.Tom didnt have to ask. Sid might as well have earned the title of spy at this point but then again tattletale snitch and blabbermouth suited him just fine. That was well enough. He didnt truly intend on skipping school today anyhow.Mmhmm he hummed absently.She tossed an expectant look over her shoulder.Promise said Tom as he rested his head in his hands with a frown.Good boy.And they sat down together as she took small sips of her coffee and the steam from the mug rose and curled about her face like a thin mask.You know Huck isnt really the one that always likes to skip school admitted Tom in his friends defense. Not anymore I mean.Ive figured out as much Aunt Polly snorted.He actually really cares about making Jim and Grace happy.Im sure he does she agreed. Jim told me hes been adjusting a little better lately at home. Thats good.Tom hummed his assent. He had been trying a lot harder recently to keep Huck on his aunts good side and it seemed to be paying off. Not to mention with Hucks adoption underway he had a real family now and real parents like Jim and Grace to guide him which gave her all the more reason to trust. Besides who were better suited for the job than them Jim had known Huck since he was a child no older than eight and always looked out for him in every way he possibly could if his own father and the rest of the town would not.Tom drummed his fingers against the tabletop restlessly and sucked in a gush of air. Socan I go now He didnt want to keep Huck waiting forever.Aunt Polly swatted her hand in his direction as if shooing him away before answering Go on then. Remember I expect you home no later than four unless you come by and tell me whats going on. She always said curfews and discipline were very important to implement with a boy like him who apparently felt he could do whatever he wanted with whoever he wanted whenever he pleased.Got it he said eager to leave and planted a kiss on her cheek as she did him.As he was about to scurry away and make his escape howeverTomHe deflated and turned to face his aunt.Dont just leave your dishes in the sink wash them SidSilence answered Aunt Polly. Presently Sid seemed to have floated off into an entirely separate world from her. His nose was buried inside a bookhis thick chemistry textbook more specifically. A folder an open notebook and a pen and pencil lay neatly arranged within reach on the tabletop. Not for the first or last time she was reminded of how different he and Tom were thinking about his organizational skills and Toms lack thereof.She cleared her throat loudly and tried again. Sidney.He did a double take from his textbook to his aunt. HmYour brother didnt walk home with you It wasnt an accusatory question so much as a curious one. She had set his curfew for four oclock after all and it was only threethirty.Oh. Uh nope replied Sid vaguely. His eyes flit back down to the page where they scanned and dissected a new chunk of text. I saw him with Huck in the gymnasium before I left though.She laughed a little bit in her throat. In that case you think hell be home on timeSid scoffed. I wouldnt count on it.She leaned against the doorframe arms crossed and nodded after a small thoughtful pause. Well. I just thought Id ask. Thank you.Mmhmm.With this she returned to the kitchen and put some tea on the stove. He could enjoy some whenever he returned home which she hoped would be within the next half hour or else she would have to punish him. And she didnt want that.So the wait began. She sat comfortably in her lounge chair and took a sip of tea each time her eyes peered over at the big hand on the grandfather clock. It ticked onwards and as she began to anticipate the four chimes that would announce Toms lateness her porcelain teacup was drained entirely of any last drops.Mary emerged from the kitchen and stood in front of her mother her hands clasped behind her back. Do you want some more tea MomPolly shook her head and offered a weak smile. No but thank you.With this Mary grabbed her copy of Seventeen from the coffee table sprawled herself over the couch and began reading. As Polly watched with faint interest she wished she had the patience and time again to read about clothes or nail polish or whichever new and easily replaceable dreamboat had collectively stolen the hearts of the nations female youth. But these were insignificant desires that were meant to stay hidden. A woman her age couldnt indulge in fantasies of her longgone girlhood.Before Polly knew it four oclock had come and gone. Now it was fourthirty and she wore her disappointment and anger on her sleeve like a guard. Toms redemption period was long over and now it was time to start pushing buttons and making calls.She pushed herself up from her chair with a heavy sigh and made her way over to the phone. Mary sensed the sudden shift in the room and looked up from her magazineMotherHes late. Of course hes late. Cant count on that boy not to be late.Mary was silent. She knew she couldnt spring to her cousins defense everytime he fell from grace.Polly lifted the phone and dialed Jims number. She waited rather impatiently for an answer.The phone clicked and a voice answered HelloA switch flickered on inside of her and she plastered a smile on her face to match the usual saccharine tone. Hello Jim. Its Polly.Oh Hello Polly. Whats going on The faint sounds of childish laughter could be heard in the background. Elizabeth and Johnny.Nothing much. Listen here I have to ask you somethingIs Tom there He was supposed to be home a little while ago andWell. You know how it goes. A laugh bubbles out from her throat and past her lips goodnatured and friendly as always.I do he joined but no Tom hasnt stopped by today actually.The stilted smile fell from Pollys face as swiftly as it came. She cradled the phone between her cheek and shoulder a bit tighter and asked Are you sure Maybe hes slipped in without anyone noticing. You know how the boys are climbing through windows all the time.I mean maybe Jim conceded sounding uncertain. Ill go up and check. Give me a secondSure sure Polly replied and waited in a brief silence that felt more like a small eternity.When Jim returned on the line she hoped her conjecture might have been confirmed. But instead he said Hes not in the room. I asked Huck and he said hed seen him last at school.She was quiet again.PollyHuck didnt walk home with him todayHe says he didnt no.Oh.More uneasy silence. Jim uttered her name again. The worry in his voice was so subdued it went unnoticed by her.Um. Its probably nothing Jim. Hes probably over at Joes orsomeones.Probably yes. Are you alrightShe wanted to keep the flow going offer another Probably but decided against it. Instead she swatted at the air and pursed her lips. Of course of course. Dont get yourself all wound up because of me hell be home within the hour I bet.This time it was Jims turn to force a laugh. Im sure of it.Well. That was all I uh wanted to know. Thanks Jim and Ill call you in a bit.Dont worry about it. Ill talk with you later okayMmhmm. Bye bye.Goodbye.She pressed down on the hook held the phone to her chest for a small moment and then began pressing more buttons in a frenzy. Hello Sereny Are you cooking supper right now IIm awfully sorry but I just had to ask is Tom with Joe Hes not home and Natalie Hello dear. I hope Im not intruding but Hello Anna Margaret Hes not there But hes got to be And that was how the mothers of Toms friends caught on to the first traces of his disappearance. After she had scoured her memory of every phone number she could possibly call and all of her endeavors came up fruitless she fell into a chair at the dining table face in her hands eyes burning hot with tears she had to blink away. She couldnt fall into hysterics not now. She refused to. Mary and Sid sat in the next room over in the living room pretending to be distracted by the television set when they knew of the panic their aunt tried to stuff down the panic that couldnt truly be concealed because it made the air in the house sour and heavy and nauseating.There was hope yet. She rose from her chair and hurried into the mud room where she pulled on her faux furlined boots. Then she burst into the living room and grabbed her scarf and heavy coat from the coat rack by the door.Aunt Polly Sid began sounding very frightened.Everythings okay she reassured much too hastily. Dont worry. Im just going to look around the neighborhood. She turned towards the door and as she placed a gloved hand on the knob said to her girl You can heat up any leftovers in the refrigerator when you get hungry. Alright MaryYes mother replied Mary dutifully.Look after your cousin until I get back Aunt Polly ordered gently.Mary took a deep quivering breath feeling the immense weight placed on her shoulders with this last demand before replying again Yes mother. She would be a good girl for her and for Sid even if her selfassurance lay in pieces at her feet like shards of broken glass. Woman and girl alike put on brave faces for the remaining boy who couldnt help but seek solace in his cousins side.And then Polly left and the silence she left behind was deafening.It was six oclock and the sun had set an hour prior. Tonight was cold as winter nights often were and as she combed over countless streets knocked on countless doors and still found no Tom she thought of nothing but him only him and hoped he had found shelter somewhere warm. As her cheeks began to sting with the harsh bite of the wind and her nose began to run like a faucet still she only thought of him.There were only so many places she could run to in the hopes of finding him and they were dwindling fast.On the fifth street over she knew had to throw in the towel.And that was why now she found herself in her lounge chair again after having dialed the police. This marked the beginning of the end. So many times throughout Toms childhood he had threatened during his infamous explosive tantrums that he would run away one day and then his aunt would miss him and be sorry for all the ways she had wronged him. She had always treated it with a grain of salt of course.The first few nights after his disappearance she hoped she had spurred this on somehow some way. She hoped her simple demands to meet a curfew proved too cruel to him and so he ran away. She hoped he had made good on these threats if only that it meant he had left by his own will and that he was safe wherever he was.But then she knew Tom too well to feed herself these lies.There wasnt a single other child that had gone missing alongside him. And who would Tom be if he didnt perform theatrics in the hopes that he would garner an audienceAll alone. Her Tom was all alone out there. Each time snow fell she looked out the windows of her big house and wondered the same question Was he cold out there Hungry StarvingShe always kept the porch light on for whenever he found his way home. For three days afterwards the police investigated the leads they were given all the while hoping a miracle would come about and they might stumble across the boy described by his aunt who very obviously knew him better than the back of her hand. They rounded up and questioned multiple different men and women who knew of his whereabouts before he had gone missing including Huck.He told them only what he knew and that was very little.When did you last see Tom this past ThursdayWhen we were leaving school. His answers were brief but honest. He wasnt all there no one could manage to grab his attention for any prolonged amount of time. His redrimmed eyes darted nervously between the tabletop and the two officers who sat opposite from him.He only spoke the truth but didnt feel particularly optimistic that anyone would believe his story. He had always been uneasy around law enforcement growing up and anyone who knew his family history would understand why. Sure he had never had the cleanest slate or the most honorable surname but did that give them the right to toss their dirty wary glances his way or to read guilt that didnt exist from his chestnut eyesWhat happened thenWe just talked like we usually did after school. Then he said he had to go. And he left.Around what time was thisUhI dont know a little after four.And then what did you do afterwardsToo many questions were being thrown in his direction all at once and each one felt as hazardous as a bomb that required defusing in a matter of seconds. They gave him no time to recover from the last and it became fairly obvious that he wasnt to be treated with the same sensitivity that a boy who wept openly would receive like perhaps Joe or Ben or little Tommy.I went home too. I mean not real soon but afterI dont know. He released a long quivering breath. Maybe ten minutes.I see. The female officer across from him tapped the open notebook with the ballpoint tip of her pen. It was strange for Huck to sit in a police station and not drown in a sea of uniforms. It was a Sunday and she was fairly dressed down for work.Jim and Grace waited outside for him. He knew they were anxious but had put on the kindest faces for him the most reassuring that everything would be alright.Hucks alibi was airtight but if the police couldnt trust a little white boy whose father had been apprehended on more than one occasion would they trust the black man and woman who fostered him in A mother and father who just wanted the laws leering eyes off of their son They knew better than Huck or Polly or any of the other white parents whose sons or daughters were questioned. The law was too eager to point fingers at whoever suited the crime best in their minds.But this was Toms best friend they were talking about.It wasnt until Polly very hotly jumped to Hucks defense that the police began to take the first begrudging steps back. After a handful of witnesses from the school and neighborhood corroborated his story Huck was left alone. On that Sunday after three restless nights that felt more like endless vigils a knock sounded on the door. Polly rose from her chair walked over to the door and opened it. It was the lead detective Judith Loftus. She couldnt pretend she was happy to see her but she acted polite. If she was in shambles her home was neat and orderly for everyone to see at the very least. She offered her a drink and when Judith declined they sat down on the sofa and got to the point whatever that might be. Polly always made certain Mary and Sid had been shooed away to their rooms before any discussion began.The conversation began as it usually had over the past few days with an act of calm that might prelude news that would land like a fist to the gut. She had been waiting for it ever since it began bracing herself beneath the burden of its possibility. Would they ever say they had found Tom She hadnt dared explore the prospect that there might be a body to find. If she tried she would venture in too deep and might not be able to make her way out again. They had found neither yet.But today something had been found.First came the question of Toms blood type and then the hasty answer. The word blood bound itself around her like chains like a weight dragging her to the bottom of the ocean.Polly released a breath she didnt know she had been holding. She couldnt stand to wait so she finally asked almost barked Well She wrung her hands in a fit of near delirium.Judith took a deep breathWhats so hard to tell me Go on spit it outand kept her eyes on Pollys locked them there like they had been trained to do whenever there was this terrible kind of announcement to make.We found a body part.The words were lost on her. She couldnt begin to comprehend their meaning. She didnt move or blink.Judith hesitated and placed a gentle hand on the womans knee. But she was too late. Polly was numb.Later whenever anyone senselessly asked her what this moment in her life had felt like she couldnt answer. She didnt remember. Her mind had forced itself to shut down entirely so she wouldnt feel.Thus began the difficult arduous but brief trek into denial. She froze over then shut her heart out from the rest of the world and its terrible terrible halftruths.Very strangely even as the tears bubbled over and began to flow freely from her eyes she did not completely break. She did not immediately fall into Judiths arms and become hysterical with grief. The cracks in her armor were glaring but denial was an even stronger shield she wielded.No body was found then.Judith was familiar with this jarring kind of response and remained mostly unfazed. She offered after a small pause No Ms. Sawyer. No body was found.We cant be sure then. That hesThat anythings happened I mean. Polly almost choked on the word. She couldnt force it out of herself not yet.Against her better judgment Judith replied softly No Ms. Sawyer.Polly dangerously pushed herself closer towards that crumbling edge in spite of everything. Whatdid you find She didnt want to know but she had to. It would kill her if she didnt. Was this body part one that a boy could do withoutAn elbow maam.She regretted this decision most of all about this particular day. For the rest of her life she wished so often that she could take that question back. Why had she thought it better that way to have asked She would never understand.Unbeknownst to her one of the neighborhood dogs a bumbling happy little bloodhound puppy that had a proneness to tripping over its own ears had found it on the edge of the wheatfield on North Main Street during a walk. Its owner immediately began to make his way home afterwards so he could call the police. He had heard news of a boy from town going missing and felt his heart drop like lead to his gut when he saw. Not long afterwards he had given the poor thing away to a family with children that he knew would fawn over it in a way he no longer could.After Judith Loftus left the house Aunt Polly allowed herself not for the first time within the next week to bury her face in her hands and sob like a little girl. Loudly. Openly. Of course Sid and Mary heard her sobs just as they had heard the newsthey never stayed up in their rooms as they were told. The sound of their aunts sobs were like nails on a chalkboard the most frightening theyd heard in their short lives.Mary separated herself from Sid flung herself up the stairs and into her bathroom so she could get sick. Then she trudged to her room and cried herself to sleep.Sid was left on the landing alone hiding behind the banister. Alive and yet not at the same time. Everywhere he looked their lives had boiled over into something hellish. He was breathing loud and hard. His heartbeat rolled like thunder in his eardrums. His cheeks had been long wet with tears that he didnt realize he was crying. How How was the world still spinning without his brother in it anymore How would one pick up the pieces of another if everyone had broken apart How was he supposed to understand such an incomprehensible truth that Tom had left for school one unsuspecting day and would never come back again He would never see his brother again. Suddenly he lost all understanding of the meaning of the word murder. And yet there was no way to deny reality any longerTom had been killed on that December 6th.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/16581383,The Extraordinary Presidents,17891797 George Washington IndependentWashington was the first American President and in the opinion of many the best. Washington had previously served as commander of the American armies during the Revolutionary War where he had slain hundreds of redcoats single handedly riding on his giant bald eagle. Washingtons rule was wise and noble as he sought to ensure that the United States would always be a font of liberty in the world and never become too involved in the affairs of other nation. Washington was famously completely unable to lie which helped him to earn the trust of the American people. Fearful of giving the president too much power Washington opted to seek only two terms as president. Upon leaving the Presidency he was carried off to heaven by the goddesses Columbia and Victoria.,General Audiences,CrossoverMultiple CrossoversAmerican Presidents
https://archiveofourown.org/works/46597225,Hessa Imagines,The persistent tapping of Hardins boot against the leg of my desk sends me over the edge. How am I supposed to study with the nuisance that is Hardin Scott. Steph decided it would be best for him to wait here our dorm room for the time being while her and Tristan make a stop at the corner store for alcohol. If you ask me Id say theyre doing more than buying alcohol. She invited me to join them in celebrating Spring Break but I would rather stay in and read my new book. Even Noah insisted on staying the night to watch movies and keep me up to date on my mothers whereabouts.If youre going to stay can you at least be quiet I tread lightly with what I say to Hardin. He is a ticking time bomb that detonates at the slightest wrong move.Am I annoying you He knows he is annoying me which is why he sits up from Stephs bed to continue his insistent tapping.Did I do something to deserve this torture I give up. Shatter Me will have to wait yet another night to be indulged. Hardin strolls across the room only inches away from my bed.Have you already forgotten You Ms. Perfect cock blocked me. It took two hours of meaningless conversation to get that girl into my room. That is until you appear demanding that I take you home. He throws his arms around the room dramatically. Is that all he thinks about Sex. Alcohol. Party. Repeat.Hardins nonsense will not phase me today. I refuse to let him belittle me to the point of holding back tears. Without a word I open my laptop. Before Im able to type in my password Hardin slams the screen shut. Theresa. Im talking to you. His breathing becomes unhinged. He knows exactly what buttons to push and when to push them.All I asked was for you to be quiet. I dont want any problems today Hardin. I look down already feeling defeated and exhausted from this conversation.His features soften. What I said must have resonated somewhere in his seemingly cold heart. Even within the sincerity and change of tone he finds a way to deflect. Why dont we play a game Ill ask you a few questions and then you can ask me anything you want.Really This is so unlike the Hardin I know. At least the Hardin I thought I knew.Absolutely. Any question your heart desires. Ill go first. I brace myself for what is to come.You have a boyfriend correct Where is he going with thisYes.Has he fucked you yetHardin. The air is stripped from my lungs. I cough to ease the painful silence in the room.I didnt make the rules of the game Theresa. Answer the question.I swipe away the layer of sweat building on my skin. Noah and I have had sex...once. He described it as making love. I describe it as an awkward unfulfilling fifteen minute pow wow. I blame his mother for instilling fear into the poor man that sex before marriage is immoral and against their values. Maybe then would he indulge in self pleasure and learn a little about the female anatomy.Yes. I hide my face out of embarrassment.Did you enjoy itIt takes me a moment to ponder his question. Of course I want to enjoy sex with Noah but not the gentle love making on our honeymoon that he goes on about. Yes I lie.I dont believe you. If anything you stocked your drawer full of all sorts of things to bring you the pleasure that your pathetic boyfriend couldnt. He smirks. For the first time in minutes I make eye contact with Hardin.What sorts of thingsHave you even... He looks between my thighs.Have I even whatTouched yourself Oh. Oh. Um...yes. I dont know what draws me to say the things I do to Hardin. Ive never shared something so intimate with anyone before. Not even Noah.See I know what women want Theresa. They most certainly dont want someone that is as bland as your boyfriend. They want they need someone to take control of their pleasure.Noah is not bland. Hes a sweet guy. A sweet guy that I dont deserve.Noahs been the most supportive since my move to WCU. Although he doesnt like Hardin that never stopped me from being around him. Unlike Hardin and his onceaweekhookups Noah doesnt claim control over who I speak to.Sweet doesnt have anything to do with how he fucks you. You deserve a man that knows what hes doing. Let me show you Theresa. The air in the room feels thick. My breathing has mimicked Hardins fast and unworldly. His filthy words sparks a fire within me making my stomach warm and tingly.Hardin. I I... I cant find the words to explain how terribly wrong this feels.You you what Noah isnt here. Steph isnt here to save you. Hes now sitting on the bed across from me. I wrap my arms around my legs bringing them closer to cover my body. I have one more question he pauses as if for effectHave you ever thought of me when you were touching yourselfI admit that Ive thought of Hardin while...pleasuring myself. Our rendezvous at the lake was my first sexual experience with Hardin. He made it a point to tease me but never actually go through with what he said. I laid on my bed later that night yearning for the dirty deeds he whispered in my ear. As much as I wanted to think about Noah Hardin kept creeping into my thoughts encouraging me through the process. Theres no point on hiding my indiscretion so I answer Yes.What were you thinking aboutHardin.Tessa. We can play the name game all he wants but I wont give into his plea. Ive already told him too much.I never got a chance to ask my questions.Correction. Question. Youre granted one question. He holds up a singular digit.Fine. One question is better than none. Have you ever thought about me while....you knowOf course I have. He says this as if its common knowledge. I think about your curves the way your lips wrap around that pen you hold so near and dear to you I think about how it would feel to have your legs wrapped my waist dragging your nails against my skin. There is no space left between us. Hardins face is so close to mine that I can almost taste the mint from his gum. Before I can object our tongues are wrestling for dominance. His arm snakes its way underneath my shirt cupping my breasts. He lays me down slowly onto the bed guiding my hands above my head. If it werent for the loud ringing of my phone bringing me back to the present I would stay like this forever. Are you going to answer that He pulls away but not for long. His lips move across my neck down to my chest.Its Noah. Shit.HHello I shush Hardin but he doesnt budge. Instead he undoes my bra to expose my breasts. Sucking and pulling at my nipples. I stare down in amazement.Keep talking Hardin mouths.Just called to check in on you. Youre sure you dont want me to come over Noahs voice sings through the phone.Im sure. I think Ill just stay in tonight and read. I try my best to stifle my moans. Hardin leaves kisses down my stomach and lands at my shorts. His eyes bore into my soul before he pulls each fabric over my legs.Sounds fun. How was your day Must he go on foreverGood. Great actually I say as I watch Hardin kiss my inner thigh inching closer to the sensitive area between my legs. He is such a tease but I want to savor this. Whatever this is. A groan escapes my mouth as he swirls his tongue in a circular motion that drives me wild. If it werent for Hardin extending a hand to cover my mouth I would have given our...situation away.Are you at yoga class You sound out of breath. Noah poor Noah. If he knew what was best for him he would end the call and block my number.Just a little tired from cleaning the dorm. You know how Steph is I huff.This is wrong. What Im doing is wrong. Noah doesnt deserve to be treated this way. He doesnt deserve to be cheated on and lied to. My thoughts are interrupted by Hardin inserting two fingers inside of me. My body unravels at the sensation of his tracing tongue and his lengthy fingers moving in and out...in and out. He uses one hand to hold my jerking body down.Tessa Are you there I had forgotten Noah was on the other line. Hardin stops momentarily to lock lips.Sweet isnt it He whispers in my ear pressing his bulge against my warmth. He is hard and in his most primal state. His black tshirt along with his jeans are sprawled across the floor within seconds only leaving him in his briefs. Inklings are etched into his skin. His body presses against mine. My body aches for his touch. My lips long for his against mine. I now understand why all of these girls crawl to Hardin pleading for something they will never have. Our lips finally meet tongues tangled and breathless. My phone falls from my hand. I pay no attention to the faint sound of Noahs voice.Hardin lowers his briefs his length popping out of his waistband. My eyes widen at the length and girth of his manhood. Hardin laughs Im assuming at my unexpected reaction. Dont be shy. I take him within my palms stroking forward and backwards as he says my name under his breath. I had always seen blowjobs in porn but never given one myself. Hopefully all of those times locked away in my room will come in handy. My mouth opens widely to embrace him in between my lips. His soft moans are enough motivation to take him wholly. Look at me. Let me see those pretty eyes He commands. His fingers tangled in my locs I stop to take a breath. You alrightI nod still unable to catch my breath. Suddenly he stands to his feet. I hope by stopping that I didnt give him the impression that I want this to end. Come here. He holds a hand out for me and I gladly oblige. He turns my body so that I am facing the desk. I lean forward using one hand to steady myself and the other to hold my breasts in place. Brushing my hair to the side he kisses the sensitive skin beneath my ear. Without notice he enters me forcefully yet careful not to make a sound. I suppress my moans by leaning further onto the desk and taking hold of the edge. Let it out He demands. His digits perform circular motions on my clit. I dont want to let the entire dorm know exactly what we are doing but hes making it so hard on me. Hardin takes ahold of my hair bringing my body closer to his. Are you going to listenI nod unable to form the words to describe the euphoria of Hardins cock thrusting into me. To torture the words out of me he stops. Somehow I muster the courage to say Please.Good girl. He thrusts even harder and deeper intertwining his arms with mine to hold my body upright and nibble gently on the tip of my ear.Hardin I moan. Every ounce of my body shaken from the parallel of his roughness and gentle touch causing me to unravel.Tell me how good I make you feel Tessa. Without pulling out Hardin migrates our bodies to the bed. I rest one leg on the mattress. Feeling a surge of confidence I use two fingers to pleasure myself as Hardins force numbs my extremities. Licking my bottom lip I face Hardin meeting his thrusts with a force of my own. His hands wander my body gripping my neck so he can fill me completely. Watching Hardin is a sight of its own. His welldefined muscles pulsating his head nodding back and forth with the rhythm of our bodies colliding. The sight of the man that got under my skin only minutes ago is permanently etched into my brain pinned for safekeeping.My head is once again pulled back his face hovering over mine. His green eyes bore into my soul his mouth pursed open moaning my name. A smile forms on my face something that surprises the both of us. Continuing this newfound confidence I whisper a few filthy words of my own. This is what you wanted To fuck me.His eyes rolling with pleasure he nods. To leave Hardin speechless I must be doing something right. I pull my weight forward releasing myself from his grip. The confusion plastered across his face is replaced my amusement as I seat him on the edge of the bed. All of my fantasies playing out in front me there is no telling how much longer I can last. I dreamt quite literally dreamt of this moment. Reluctant to admit it I needed this. Whatever this is.Bringing me back to reality Hardin pulls me in by the small of my back leaving rough kisses along my collarbone. Giving me no time to recover from our rowdy screwing my body is now on top of his. Taking my nipple between his teeth he pushes my ass against his erection. There is nothing gentle or sweet regarding the way he reacts to my touch.Finally having enough of his teasing I lower myself onto his member using all of my strength to support my weight. My hand rests around his neck as I lower my face next to his whispering sweet nothings in his ear. An empowering move that erases all doubts and fears lingering in my subconscious. Does that feel good Hardin Rather than giving me a response he moans. I asked you a question Hardin. Does it feel good My pussy swallowing every inch of youFuck Tessa he moans. Youre going to make me come.That is all I need to hear to seek for what is mine. In this moment he is all mine. Hardin is underneath my spell a spell of lust that is. I tighten my grip on his neck and use the remaining strength I have to push my body harder rougher swiveling my hips in ways I never have before. I want you to come inside of me. Please Hardin. The words leave my mouth before I register their meaning.Fuuuuuck. Hardin is a panting mess. He fills me completely a foreign feeling that to my surprise I enjoy. I plop down next to him my limbs giving in. Have I fulfilled all of your fantasies Despite feeling out of breath and a lack of energy I stare at the grumpy man before me reveling in the high of the pleasure he brought me.,Explicit,Hessa - Freeformhardin - FreeformHardin Scott - FreeformTessa Young - FreeformAfter ImaginesHessa Imaginesafter seriesAfterImaginesOne ShotDirty Talkthe books are sm better let's be frugly lovecolleen hoover - FreeformTate Collins - FreeformMiles Archer - Freeform
https://archiveofourown.org/works/44511247,Since,Terry I hear my father cry out with her voice. The source of the voice down the stairs. I cry to myself at the lack of sleeping in any longer and spring from my cramped yet inexplicably comfortable and happinessinducing cot. Its provided my so much pleasure over the years I will surely miss it in my new phase of life. As I perfectly attend to each corner of the bed forming excellent right angels I take my time as this will indeed be the last time I will complete this chore for some months at the least.Terry He craws once more.I am upright I scream down. The cupboards and drawers clatter open and shut downstairs my dad must be cooking up a storm no a typhoon of a good breakfast. The butterflies in my stomach became pupa again as I drew closer to the restroom on the second floor of our house. Each step increases the density of the critters in my stomach until I cant hardly stand my anticipation any longer. I have spent dozens of months years getting prepared for the life of college and it is finally upon me like the moon on an eclipse. My holidays and every spare moment have been devoted to bettering myself in preparation of university while my socalled peers were wasting their lives becoming drunk and fornicating most likely. I am grateful that my father instilled good traditional values in me so that I would not put my entire future in danger like those cretins. I would never waste my time on pathetic recreation. I could still remember the brilliant shining moment when I received the letter of destiny as I called it. I was accepted to University of Washington State University and I could not ever be happier. I knew that I was the most qualified person as I did not waste my time like other children my age but I was still thrilled that University of Washington State University also saw my value. My father had cried for days in fact he probably spent this morning crying before cooking me a breakfast. I have to admit I would have been very proud of me too. All of my devoted studying had paid off. There was a day long ago where I considered departing from the state of Washington for university but I am glad that my father had shown me reason and talked me out of that idiotic choice. I love familiar settings and routines just like my father. We are both males no men of order. And that is the way I like it.The steaming water boils away my tenseness as I wonder how long have I been in this shower I speed up my routine and quickly wash my hair rapidly scrub my body and trim the rest of my body with haste using the manscaping kit that my father passed down to me to get rid of all the stubble covering my body and orifices.As I tie a knot in the towel covering my naked body my father again calls out my name Terry. I ignore him as I often do after all I am an adult now and independence is a sign of maturity. He is just worried about the momentous event of my departing for college finally so I cut him some slack. I would be more worried too but I am more at ease as I have planned for this day for years all the way down to the nanosecond of how I would spend this day as well as the next four years or seven and a half semesters. My girlfriend Noa will come to the house to travel with me and with my father as well. The three of us. Noa is one grade younger than me but she is the same age as me besides a month and a few days. I mentally curse her jerk of a father for delaying her entrance into public school by way of Kindergarten. Noa could be in the same grade as me but instead she is a senior since she is one grade below me. Noa is always the prom queen has a perfect GPA and is usually the student body president when I am not it. She is brilliant inside and out and will of course join me at University of Washington State University next year since she is one grade younger than me due to her fathers negligence. I sure do wish she could accompany me today though as besides my father and her who will only be at college temporarily for today only I will not know a single soul at the college campus. I cross my fingers as much as I can and make a fervent wish for a decent roommate as everything will be okay if my roommate is as put together as I am.TERReNCEIm descending as I speak I request you not to call my name again Puhleaze I yell as I slide down the stairs.Noa is sitting with her legs crossed beneath her across my father at the breakfast table dressed in a powder blue pantsuit her usual attire of choice. Her perfectly blonde hair is combed and has just the right amount of barely any product to be perfectly coiffed.Heyyo college boy She perfectly smiles a bright and perfect smile with her straight and perfectly chiseled teeth gleaming at me while she stands up and yanks me into a tight bear hug.Hey I give her an equally perfect smile and pull my dirty hair back once she releases me from her powerful grip.My darling boy we can wait the few moments it would take you to put your hair into a presentable state my father quietly critiques staring at me with disapporving orbs.I slipe to the hallway and gaze deeply into my reflection in the mirror that hangs there. The hallway mirror reveals my disheveled state and I am ashamed at the truthfulness of my fathers kind words. I nod with precision father is correct. My hair should be in a decent state on today of all days. It is a good thign that my father reminded me so that I could rectify this mistake. My dad never takes pause when it comes to pointing out my mistakes all so that I can grow. He always always mentions my mistakes.I shall place your luggage into the vehicle Noa offers to me. She takes the keys out of the my pocket and after kissing me briefly on the cheek she disappears entirely.The caterpillars in my stomach are digivolving into butterflies that do the macarena now as I shake with nerves. I walk with precisely measured steps to our 2015 Ford sedan. At least there are two hours in which the butterflies can take flight and leave me and after that Ill be at college.

The day was finally here. Her first day of college. She felt a small tug on her hand that eventually guided her forward through the crowd toward the building which displayed a sign that read Declan Hall. Come on Tess We need to hurry and get your things to your room so I can find my dorm building. Tessa smiled at the familiar voice that came from her longtime boyfriend Noah. She and Noah had so much history together their whole lives to be exact. She felt so happy that she would be able to start her college journey alongside him. As they pushed open the door to her new home for the foreseeable future their eyes were filled with flashes of busy posters bright blankets and questionable clothing. In the center of it all sat a beautiful girl with hiplength brown hair and a smile that could light up the darkest room. Hi Im Steph You must be Tessa she said as she jumped up from her place on the bed. Tessa smiled as she confirmed this but her attention was soon taken by a brooding but incredibly attractive boy sitting in the chair by Stephs closet. His dark and curly hair clung to his sharp features. His eyes bore into her giving her the strangest tingling feeling that ran throughout her body. Tessa youre being spoken to she heard jerking her out of her staring contest with the mysterious boy. Im so sorry Noah continued she usually isnt this rude. Did he just call me rude she thought as her cheeks burned red. Steph smiled and patted Tessa on the shoulder. Dont worry girl I remember my first day too. Its so much to take in. Luckily youll have me to show you the ropes Tessa felt a strong bond with Steph already. Her eye caught the boy in the corner of the room once more. He sat slumped in the chair with his eyes glued to the pages of the book he held. It is one of her favorites Wuthering Heights. She once again found herself lost in watching him. He is stunningly handsome. She watched as Steph grabbed his hand and drug him toward their door waving goodbye and expressing sentiments that shed return soon. Tessa smiled and waved but was quickly halted by Noahs enraged face taking up her entire view. As he waved his finger close to her face and spit hateful words she flinched. Dont ever embarrass me like that again Tessa. I mean it. Youre so clueless and ditzy zoning out the way you always do. Im here to make a name and career for myself and I wont let a foolish girl like you stop me from having everything I want. Dont think I didnt see you staring at that waste of space with his nose in a book either. Do I need to remind you who owns youI quickly shook my head though it didnt stop Noah from throwing one of my beloved books against the wall and shoving me onto my new bed. As I went down before Noah turned to leave I could have swore I saw the strange boy from the corner of my room staring blankly at the scene in front of him.,Teen And Up Audiences,RomanceAngstDramaHurt/Comfort
https://archiveofourown.org/works/42067440,Rebel Without A Cause,Hes more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same. Emily Bronte Wuthering HeightsBath United Kingdom Told from Tessas P.O.V.I knew I should have hopped off my bike when it started pouring and I do mean pouring. It hadnt been raining for two minutes and I was already drenched. The bikes wheels wobbled worryingly on the cobblestones. I was just about to stop and jump off when I came to this long downwards hill.This is where I had to make a rushed decision. I could either hop off my bike here and try and walk it down the notsogentle slope or I could quickly ride down it and stop at the bottom. Riding down would be a lot faster and I knew the street would be super slippery if I attempted to walk down it in my soaked converses. As anyone who wears converses in Europe would know theyre not the best shoes on slippery pavements. In half a minute I elected to ride down the hill estimating it would take less than thirty seconds. That was one of the worst decisions Ive ever made in my lifeAnd one of the best.What Im about to describe happened in a matter of seconds. Down the bike went progressively speeding up on the very wet cobblestones. All seemed well at first. Then to my absolute and utter horror this hooded figure appeared out of the blue. This tall man had his hood up and wore a sheer black leather raincoat. He must have had earbuds in or something cause he didnt react to me screaming out to him calling for him to get out of the way. He didnt see me coming barrelling down at a rapid pace until it was already too late.I now saw I had a new choice to make. I could crash into this person and send us both flying or try and stay clear of him. Obviously and somewhat unconsciously my brain picked the latter which turned out to be a big mistake. With all my might I turned the bike handle to the left without first looking what was beside me. Turns out it was a big oak tree. Were talking like a massive tree. Unlike the now flabbergasted stunned guy there was no way I could avoid the tree trunk which laid in front of my path as sturdy as a steel pole. All I could do was wince my eyes shut and brace for the impact.You know that feeling when you can see something horrible thats about to happen to you and theres nothing you can do to stop it That was my reality just then. The bikes front wheel collided straight into the tree and I was violently flung off the seat. The ground about ten feet in front of me broke my fall with my leg feeling like someone took a sledgehammer to it the immediate pain was that intense. My hands instinctively flew out to cushion my landing resulting in them getting torn up. The side of my face just grazed the pavement leaving some mild cuts and bruises on my right cheek. Despite my terrible fall and it was terrible my top half was relatively unscathed. My bottom half howeverThe strange man witnessed the whole thing with gigantic eyes. Holy shit Are you ok I heard him yell very loudly and alarmed. He immediately ran over to getting on one knee to assess the damage. His gaze repeatedly scanned me over for any visible injury. Are you hurt His voice was more than a little panicked. I hissed too in pain to move right away. My hand reached down to my throbbing leg. NNugh My lips groaned as my fingers ran over my jeans. It felt like my knee had a heartbeat of its own.This guy whoever he was didnt hesitate to take complete control over the situation. His hands rose up in front of him as if ready to move at any moment. Are you alright Can you stand He spoke with a British ascent probably a local man. When I didnt answer with anything other than agonized moans he started to put the pieces together faster than I was able to in my current condition. Does your leg hurt He finally asked a question I felt capable of answering. YYeah. II think its broken I hissed again as I tried to move it. Yup there was definitely something wrong with my leg. Im just so thankful only my leg was hurt and not my head. Broken bones are one thing concussions are another.The man inspected the contortion my leg was in and straightened up. I watched as he pulled out an iPhone from his jackets inside pocket. Right. Im calling an ambulance he announced while dialling. This sent me into a panic almost as much as my busted leg did. Without thinking my arm stretched up to him and I spoke with a tone I hadnt since wed met. No please dont Dont Im here on a visa and I dont know if my insurance will cover that it wouldnt in America. To my surprise he shot me an annoyed look. Youre lying on the ground with a broken leg in the pouring rain. Im calling for an ambulance he declared more firmly this time. No No no no Please Ill be fine Look Ill walk myself to the hospital. Walk How do you plan to walk when you cant even stand Ill be alright just. just please dont call an ambulance I really cant afford that extra expense right now. Not that Im starting university in a couple of weeks.Eying me upset for a minute the guy seemed at war with himself. He didnt put his phone away but he didnt make the call either. My nerves did calm a little when he lowered the hand holding the phone after a tense second. Do you even know where the hospital is He did not sound happy with me. I shook my head but attempted to look not too worried which I was. IIll find it. He rolled his eyes and glanced off aimlessly to the side. I was about to say something when his eyes dramatically rolled a second time. Swearing under his breath he proceeded to tear off his jacket in that angry fashion you see sometimes.My eyes widened as I suddenly felt his coat drape over my head. He didnt put it over my shoulders no. He put it overtop my head covering my hair too from the rain. I could feel his body heat in the fabric it smelt like an old worn leather coat with a hint of booze. The guy next reached down to carefully grab my forearm lifting me up as gently as he could and slinging my arm around his shoulder. Holding that arm with one hand his other arm coiled firmly around my waist effectively holding me in place. I was able to stand on my good leg with my limp leg dragging beside me. The rain was still coming down hard and he was getting soaked in the black tshirt he was only wearing on his upper half now. His coat acted like a good shield blocking the rain from me almost entirely while he was getting drenched to the bone. With one last look at each other his fingers gave my wrist over his shoulder a squeeze.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/37265083,End Of The Day,Tom schaute aus dem Fenster des vollgepackten Tesla Model 3. Mit einem Ohr h√∂rte er Tonys Monolog √ºber die besten Jahre seines Lebens die ihm nun bevor st√ºnden. Er erz√§hlte von allen M√§dchen die er schon auf Instagram angeschrieben hat. Sie waren noch nicht mal in Cambridge angekommen und schon schien es als w√§re Tonys Terminkalender bis zum dritten Semester mit Partys und belanglosen Dates ausgebucht. Tom wusste dass er entgegen seinem Willen auf einigen dieser Partys anwesend sein musste. Partys waren noch nie sein Ding aber er hatte Tony versprochen sich dieses Mal M√ºhe zu geben Freunde zu finden. Doch er musste zugeben dass dies nicht die schlechteste Idee war. Vielleicht lernte er hier endlich jemanden kennen der ihn verstand. Seit der Grundschule war Tony seine einzige Bezugsperson und er bef√ºrchtete dass er zwischen den ganzen Partys und Frauen wenig Zeit f√ºr ihn haben w√ºrde . Sie gingen zwar noch zur selbe Unihatten aber keine gemeinsamen Kurse mehr. Tony studiert nat√ºrlich Economics so wie es sein erfolgreicher Vater f√ºr Ihn vorgesehen hatte. Etwas anderes w√§re f√ºr den Jungen dessen gr√∂√ütes Vorbild Elon Musk war nicht in Frage gekommen. Deshalb hatte er zum Abschluss den Tesla von seinen Eltern geschenkt bekommen. Tom hatte sich f√ºr seinen besten und einzigen Freund nat√ºrlich gefreutwar aber auch ziemlich neidisch. Er hatte von seinen Eltern einen 30 Amazon Gutschein bekommen. Dies zeigte ihm nur wieder dass seine Eltern diesen wichtigen Tag der vermutlich der wichtigste Tag in seinem Leben war vergessen hatten und nur eben kurz vor der Feier als Notl√∂sung an der Tankstelle gehalten hatten. Er konnte den Gutschein bestimmt f√ºr Uni Lekt√ºren nutzen aber durchdacht war dieses Geschenk auf keinen Fall. Wenigstens muss Tom seine Eltern nun nicht mehr sehen. Endlich kann er sein eigenes Leben f√ºhren und sich seine eigene Zukunft gestalten. Er ist zwar kein Fan von Partys und vielen Menschen aber in Cambridge kann er endlich Englische Literatur studieren und seinen Traum verwirklichen. In Vorbereitung auf sein Studium hatte Tom seine Ferien damit verbracht alle klassischen Werke die er kannte noch einmal zu lesen. Diese waren mit seinen wenigen schwarzen Kleidungsst√ºcken in zwei Kisten untergebracht. Tony hingegen schien sein komplettes Zimmer in dieses Auto gestopft zu haben. Wenigstens musste er sich so keine Sorgen machen dass seine Kisten bei Tonys schrecklicher Fahrweise umkippen. Seine B√ºcher sollten unbesch√§digt in Cambridge ankommen da dies der einziger Besitz war der Tom √ºberhaupt etwas bedeutete. In diesem Moment bog Tony auf den Parkplatz des Wohnheims ein. Die Fahrt hatten sie schonmal unversehrt √ºberlebt. Auf dem Parkplatz waren etliche andere Studenten die wie aufgescheuchte H√ºhner ihre Zimmer suchten. Tom hoffte zutiefst dass keiner dieser aufgedrehten Studenten sein Mitbewohner war. Tony parkte das Auto schief und ziemlich raumgreifend ein und schaltete den Motor aus. Tom lie√ü sich ein letztes Mal in den Sitz sacken und atmete tief ein und aus. Ihn hatte noch nicht so richtig die Motivation gepackt sich diesen Menschenmassen zu n√§hern. Tony hingegen war voller Vorfreude auf die erste Party die direkt heute Abend startete. Das wird so ein geiles Jahr Tony grinste von einem Ohr zum Anderen. Tom konnte diese Freude nicht teilen. Am liebsten w√ºrde er die ganze Nacht im Auto verbringen und erst aussteigen wenn alle anderen Studenten weg waren. Aber in dem Moment hatte Tony auch schon die T√ºr ge√∂ffnet und begann seine Kisten auszur√§umen. Es kostete ihn viel √úberwindung aber schlie√ülich raffte auch Tom sich auf und stieg aus. Tony war bereits in erste Gespr√§che mit langweilig aussehenden College Studenten verwickelt. Schnell nahm Tom seine Sachen aus dem Auto verabschiedete sich mit einem kurzem Wink von Tony und machte sich auf dem Weg zu seinem Dorm Room. In einer Mail hatte er vor einigen Wochen schon seine Zimmernummer erhalten. 78 also vermutlich im Erdgeschoss. Er lief an den ersten offenen Zimmert√ºren vorbei und sah wie sich verschiedenste Studenten einrichteten. Bei den meisten konnte er den Studiengang leicht erraten. In einem Zimmer sah er ein Lebensgro√ües Skelett. Da war es nicht schwer zu erkennen dass das blonde M√§dchen Medizin studierte. Endlich entdeckte er am Ende des Flures die Zimmernummer 78. Mit dem Fu√ü sto√ü er die angelehnte T√ºr auf und der Geruch von Axe Bodyspray stieg ihm unangenehm in die Nase. Im Raum stand ein blonder Muskelberg. Er sah aus wie das Cover einer Menshealth Zeitschrift. Auf einem der beiden Schr√§nke standen bereits gro√üe Protein Pulver Dosen und zwei Kurzhanteln. An einer Wand hingen Trikots von Sportmannschaften die Tom nicht zuordnen konnte. Mannschaftssport war genauso wie Partys nicht sein Ding. Tom verfluchte den Mitarbeiter der f√ºr die Zimmerverteilung zust√§ndig war. Nat√ºrlich musste Tom mit so einem Typen das Zimmer teilen. Hallo seufzte Tom bem√ºht freundlich zu wirken. Ich glaube ich bin dein neuer Mitbewohner. Sein Zimmergenosse drehte sich um und sah ihn freudestrahlend an. Ehe Tom sich versah steckte er schon in einer Umarmung mit dem gro√üen Blonden Mann. Sch√∂n dich kennenzulernen Ich bin Thor. Tom empfand diese Situation als √§u√üerst unangenehm doch antworte trotzdem etwas erdr√ºckt Ich bin Tom. Tom Riddle. Sch√∂n dich kennen zu lernen Tom wir werden ne geile Zeit haben hier. Ja bestimmt murmelte Tom vor sich hin. Ich studiere Sport und Mathematik auf Lehramt. Und du Nat√ºrlich Sport. Was sonst. Jeder Gym Dude studiert Sport dachte Tom. In seiner Vorstellung bestand das ganze Studium nur aus Fitnessstudio Turn√ºbungen und Joggen. Englische Literatur antwortete Tom knapp. Er war sich nicht sicher ob er das Versprechen dass er Tony gegeben hatte halten konnte. Neue Freunde finden ist nicht so leicht wenn alle um einen herum so anders sind als er selber. Thor redete noch weiter vor sich hin aber Tom h√∂rte ihm kaum noch zu. Er schaute sich weiter im Zimmer um. 2 Betten 2 Schr√§nke und 2 Schreibtische. Luxuri√∂s ist es hier ja nicht aber das war er auch nicht von zuhause gewohnt. Seine Seite des Zimmers war zum Gl√ºck nicht belegt mit Sportger√§ten und Pulvern. Er √∂ffnete den ersten Karton mit seinen wenigen Dingen. Seine Kleidung hing er im Schrank auf und die B√ºcher ordnete er sorgf√§ltig auf seinem Schreibtisch und Schrank. Er sollte sich vermutlich noch ein weiteres Regal anschaffen da er noch einige weitere B√ºcher anschaffen musste. An seinen neuen Mitbewohner musste Tom sich definitiv noch gew√∂hnen aber es ist besser als sein Elternhaus. Alles w√§re besser als sein Elternhaus. Einige Stunden waren seit der Ankunft in seiner neuen Heimat bereits vergangen. Thor war seit etwa einer halben Stunde weg. Vermutlich auf irgendeiner Party oder im Fitnessstudio. Tom sa√ü alleine auf seinem Bett und las. Er las immer. B√ºcher waren sein Zufluchtsort wenn er sich nicht wohl f√ºhlte oder Zeit f√ºr sich brauchte. √Ñhnlich ging es ein Stockwerk h√∂her und auf der anderen Seite des DormBlocks auch einem andern Jungen. Legolas war jedoch nicht alleine. Katara sa√ü auf seinem Schreibtischstuhl und drehte darauf mehrere gelangweilte runden Taylor sah sich ihr mittlerweile drittes Outfit im Spiegel an und Legolas lag auf seinem Bett mit einem Buch vor der Nase von welchem er nur aufsah wenn Taylor seine Meinung verlangte. Er hatte Taylor vor ungef√§hr einem Jahr auf der Party eines gemeinsamen Freundes kennengelernt und bis vor einem Monat nicht viel mit ihr gesprochen aber zumindest kannten sie sich und verstanden sich auch ganz gut. Katara hatten die beiden heute morgen kennengelernt. Sie war schon am Tag zuvor in ihr Zimmer gezogen und bot den beiden ihre Hilfe an. Da sie auch mit ihnen englische Literatur studierte wollten sie sich gemeinsam auf das Semester vorbereiten und nun waren sie hier. Was ist mit dem hier fragte Taylor und zeigte Legolas ein goldenes Pailletten Top welches sie gerade angezogen hatte. Legolas sah auf den Finger in sein Buch gelegt um die Zeile nicht zu verlieren. Mhh das Rote fand ich besser. Er setzte sich auf und warf ein Lesezeichen zwischen die Seiten seines Buches. Du bist jetzt schon mindestens eine halbe Stunde am anprobieren hast du nicht mittlerweile mal was gefunden Es kann ja nicht jeder Sachen von seinem Vater gekauft bekommen die auch noch gut aussehen. seufzte Taylor und schl√ºpfte aus ihrem Oberteil.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/37323538,"A Complete, Comprehensive Rant Review on After",Hi Dear Friend reading thisIve made a decision. I may never emerge alive from this but I am determined. I will be reading After the fanfic. Note I will not comment on the movie or the book. I am going to be reading the fanfic the original the place where it all started. I am going to be writing notes every chapter commenting on everything from the plot to the characters to writing style.There will be discussion into sexual assault and other possible triggers so if that is not something you feel comfortable reading about Id suggest not reading this or chapters that have been marked with trigger warnings TW. Also I dont recommend reading the book as it does display and glorify abuse gaslighting nearrape etc. I would like to note before I begin this despite doing this I have immense respect for Anna Todd for writing this. It is never easy to write novels no matter the quality. Moreover she was not only able to get the book physically published but she also got a movie deal so kudos to her. By doing this I do not mean to impose my opinion on you if you read the bookfanfic or watched the movie and enjoy them. Hats off to you if you like them have fun. I do not wish to dictate peoples personal opinions. What I comment on is simply spreading my views to the general public. I do not in any sense wish for my work to be taken as gospel and I highly recommend reading the book or the fanfic andor watching the movie for yourself because no persons opinion is the same. Form your own opinion Im simply expressing mine. All that being said it begins. I am slightly dreading this. Forewarning this is a Harry Styles fanfic and as far as I can see usually with the protagonist Tessa Young in a firstperson view.Im putting the blurb shown on Wattpad here to create an overview if you do not wish to partake in the fanfic book or movie. Blurb Tessa Young is an 18yearold college student with a simple life excellent grades and a sweet boyfriend. She always has things planned out ahead of time until she meets a rude boy named Harry with too many tattoos and piercings who shatters her plans.Immediate Criticisms on the BlurbYet another sweet innocent conservative girl x bad boy story however a lot of romance stories are of some version of this stereotypical plot. I am not completely opposed to the plot idea I simply do not understand the obsession with having a brooding Alpha male with a terrible past and this innocent girl has to save him. I understand having emotional connections can aid a person if they are in a difficult situation however it is not their responsibility to fix them. This will often lead to a Savior Complex in the protagonist see Twilight for further references. Also the emphasis on tattoos and piercings being directly related to being a bad influence is an outdated stereotype. Piercing and tattoos do not reference a personality they are simply a means of expression and should not be considered when discussing a persons character.,Teen And Up Audiences,Rant ReviewI wrote this like 2 years ago in an angry hyperfixationI will need to edit thisAfterGenuine Opinionsdon't attack meSryslythirsty After fans don't come at methirsty Twilight fans dont come after me eitherangry Floppy rantsThis starts out professional soundingand quickly devolves into chaos
https://archiveofourown.org/works/37266226,End Of The Day,Tom looked out the window of the packed Tesla Model 3. With one ear he heard Tonys monologue about the best years of his life that were yet to come. He talked about all the girls he has already written to on Instagram. They hadnt even gotten to Cambridge yet and it seemed like Tonys thirdsemester schedule was filled with parties and casual meaningless dates. Tom knew that against his will he had to be present at some of these parties. Parties have never been his thing but he had promised Tony hed make an effort to make friends this time. But he had to admit that this wasnt the worst idea. Maybe here he finally met someone who understood him. Tony had been his only friend since elementary school and he feared Tony would have little to no time for him between all the parties and women. Although they still went to the same university they no longer took any courses together. Of course Tony is studying economics just like his successful father intended for him. Nothing else would have been possible for the boy whose greatest role model was Elon Musk. Thats why his parents gave him the Tesla when he graduated. Of course Tom was happy for his best and only friend but he was also quite jealous. He had received a 30 Amazon voucher from his parents. This only showed him again that his parents had forgotten this special day which was probably the most important day in his life and had just stopped at the gas station just before the party as a last resort. He could certainly use the voucher for university readings but this gift was by no means thoughtful. At least Tom doesnt have to see his parents anymore. But at the end of the day he can live his own life and shape his own future. He may not be a fan of parties and crowds but in Cambridge he can finally study English literature and make his dreams come true. In preparation for his studies Tom had spent his vacations rereading all the classic works he knew. These were housed in two boxes with his few black clothes. Tony on the other hand seemed to have stuffed his entire room into this car. At least he didnt have to worry about his boxes tipping over from Tonys terrible driving. His books were to reach Cambridge undamaged as that was the only possession Tom cared about at all. At that moment Tony pulled into the dorm parking lot. They had survived the trip unscathed. There were a number of other students in the parking lot looking for their rooms like frightened chickens. Tom fervently hoped none of these hyper students were his roommates. Tony parked the car crookedly taking up quite a bit of space and switched off the engine. Tom slumped back in the seat one last time breathing deeply in and out. He hadnt really had the motivation to approach these crowds yet. Tony on the other hand was full of anticipation for the first party which started right away tonight. Its going to be such a great year Tony grinned from ear to ear. Tom couldnt share that joy. He would have preferred to spend the whole night in the car and only get out after all the other students had gone. But at that moment Tony had already opened the door and started to clear out his boxes. It took a lot of effort for him but eventually Tom pulled himself together and got out. Tony was already engaged in initial conversations with boringlooking college students. Tom quickly took his things out of the car waved goodbye to Tony and made his way to his dorm room. He had already received his room number in an email a few weeks ago. 78 so probably on the ground floor. He walked past the first open room doors and saw how various students set up. He could easily guess the major of most of them. In one room he saw a lifesize skeleton. It wasnt difficult to see that the blonde girl was studying medicine. He finally spotted room number 78 at the end of the hallway. He kicked open the ajar door and the smell of Axe body spray hit his nostrils. In the room stood a blond muscle mountain. He looked like the cover of a mens health magazine. On one of the two cabinets there were already large cans of protein powder and two dumbbells. Jerseys from sports teams hung on a wall that Tom couldnt identify. Team sports like parties werent his thing. Tom cursed the employee who was responsible for room allocation. Of course Tom had to share a room with a guy like that. Hello Tom sighed trying to look friendly. I think Im your new roommate. His roommate turned and looked at him happily. Before Tom knew it he was in a hug with the tall blond man. Nice to meet you I am Thor. Tom found this situation extremely uncomfortable but still answered a bit smothered Im Tom. Tom Riddle. Nice to meet you Tom were going to have a great time here. Yes definitely Tom murmured to himself. Im studying physical education and mathematics to become a teacher. And you Of course sports. What else. Every gym dude studies physical education thought Tom. In his mind the whole course consisted only of going to the gym doing gymnastics and jogging. English literature Tom answered briefly. He wasnt sure if he could keep the promise he had made to Tony. Making new friends is not easy when everyone around you is so different from yourself. Thor kept talking but Tom barely listened to him. He continued to look around the room. 2 beds 2 closets and 2 desks. Its not luxurious here but he wasnt used to that at home either. Fortunately his side of the room was not occupied by sports equipment and powder. He opened the first box with his few things. He hung his clothes in the closet and carefully arranged his books on his desk and closet. He should probably get another shelf as he had a few more books to buy. Tom definitely had to get used to his new roommate but its better than his parents house. Anything would be better than his childhood home. A few hours had already passed since arriving in his new home. Thor had been gone for about half an hour. Probably at some party or in the gym. Tom sat alone on his bed reading. He always read. Books were his sanctuary when he wasnt feeling well or needed some time to himself.Similarly one floor up on the other side of the dorm block another boy was feeling similarly. However Legolas was not alone. Katara sat on his desk chair and did several bored spins on it Taylor looked at her now third outfit in the mirror and Legolas lay on his bed with a book in front of his nose which he only looked up from when Taylor asked for his opinion. Hed met Taylor at a mutual friends party about a year ago and hadnt spoken to her much until a month prior but at least they knew each other and got along pretty well. The two had met Katara this morning. She had moved into her room the day before and offered to help them both. Since she was also studying English literature with them they wanted to prepare for the semester together and here they were. What about this Taylor asked showing Legolas a gold sequined top she had just put on. Legolas looked up finger in his book not to lose the line. Mhh I liked the red one better. He sat up and tossed a bookmark between the pages of his book. Youve been trying on clothes for at least half an hour now havent you found something in the meantime Not everyone can get clothes bought by their dad that also look good. Taylor sighed and slipped off her shirt. She wasnt ashamed. Not in front of Legolas. She knew he wasnt going to tease her or try god knows what. He didnt have a girlfriend but nothing will ever happen between them. I dont wear what he chooses for me Legolas mumbled and put his book on the bedside table. He wasnt sure if the others could hear or understand him but it didnt matter. He was happy to finally be able to make his own decisions and didnt want to be reminded by a stupid party outfit that for the first 18 years every decision was made for him.,Teen And Up Audiences,Alternate Universe - College/UniversityCrossoverFluff and AngstMinor Injuriesminor toxic relationshipMinor Drug Useproblematic charactersParody
https://archiveofourown.org/works/30992711,After the Fall,Growing up I always knew life would never be easy or simple. I understand there will be complications along the way despite being sheltered by my mom. I understand I will not get what I want like a fairytale princess romance relationship. I understand relationships will have hard times and easy times. I understand growing up will be a rollercoaster of emotions and trials.Even when I understand all of this I was not prepared for everything to bodyslam me into the ground the moment I stepped into college and was involved with people I should have never been involved in the first place.What makes it worse is how some of it was brought on because of my decisions. I could easily blame it all on one person but there are some things I am slowly realizing I could have easily avoided. I could have stayed faithful to Noah. I could have been friendlier with Steph instead of judging her. I could have changed rooms to avoid seeing him. I could have never interacted with him.Damnit If only I have never been some na√Øve about some of these situations I would still be at Washington Central University right now and have friends I could trust. Like Landon for instance. I wonder what he is up to right now. Maybe I should text him one day to see how he is doing.For now I am living in this motel room because I could not stand listening to my mom saying I told you so every waking minute. She was right in a way with how I could have avoided some events but I wish she did not have to be controlling overbearing and overprotective of me. There are things in life I know I will have to experience on my own without all of that. She needs to understand it and I hope one day we will sit down and discuss it.I got to take control of my life. I feel like I am starting to spiral out of control and lashing out to those who do not deserve it. I cannot keep dwelling on what happened shouldve couldve wouldve and school life. I am starting my internship tomorrow so I need to focus on that. I will be working in Vance Publishing and from what I have heard about the CEO Christian Vance he is terrifying to work with if I do not prove myself on the first day. That is enough convincing for me I need to push forward and worry about everything else later. I need this paid internship to live on my own for a while until I can afford to stay somewhere else and it may help me put in my firstyear deposit at the university in Seattle. Should I focus on school first or home firstBreathe in. Breath out.Ok once I am settled into work I will start saving up money. Whichever is the least expensive route I will use the funds for it first. Sounds like a plan to me. Anything else inbetween Ill deal with at the moment. Nothing will detract me from this plan.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/30333903,"""Action:"" An After FanFiction | Herophine",HeroIm late. Again. One more time and I can consider myself fired. I keep forgetting to set my fucking alarm its been hard getting used to US time after 23 years in London. Its not like that tired old excuse will fly with my boss though. I have been living in California for almost two months after all. As I hop over the counter and throw my apron on my coworker throws me a disapproving stare. You better hope Joe doesnt find out. Shane raises his eyebrows the ebony skin around his lips crinkling. Hes trying not to smile but it isnt working. Find out what I play with the register acting like Ive been there all morning. The man in question waltzes around the corner an empty coffee cup in hand. Speak of the Devil. What time did you get here Tiffin The boss drawls holding out the empty cup. I take it shrugging my shoulders. A little before eight. Same as always.He purses his thin lips under his greying beard. I can tell hes pissed. Our boss looks to Shane for assurance as I whip up his usual order a nonfat mocha frappe. Yup Shane lies. We got in together this morning. Joe frowns. He grabs the full cup back from me and turns to leave. Just dont forget whose name is on this Cafe. If I catch you coming in late one more time youre done Hero. Got it. I deadpan. Once hes gone Shane turns to me and laughs. I dont know how you do it. Just be careful...you dont want to lose your visa. Hes right. Without a stable job and passing marks in my online college courses Ill be on a flight back to the UK in no time. Dont worry about me. Ill be fine. I only wish I believed my own words. xXx Later that day after the usual rush dies down Shane and I pop around the back of Joes Cafe for a smoke break. At least I smoke and Shane tries in vain to hide his judgemental stares.How did that audition go the other day He asks nonchalantly. Its finally my turn to roll my eyes. It was a bust. Same as all the others. I moved to Los Angeles with the dream of becoming an actor. Little did I know its not as easy as they make it look on Reality TV. Almost all of the guys my age out here want the same exact thing but most of us just end up as a barista instead. The casting director said theres no shortage of average looking white guys with a funny accent.Shane sucks his teeth. Ouch. Sorry man. At least you still have background work to fall back on until you get your big break. Background work. One of the most oversaturated and unrewarding gigs in the business. 18 hour days little pay and no respect. Yeah...thats sure to pay off. Speaking of pay we should get back in there and finish our shift. Dont want to get on Joes bad side. My coworker watches me stomp out my cigarette then walks back into the cafe. The second the door closes I get a notification on my phone. Luanne at Central Casting wants to know if youre available to work background on a movie set. Up to two weeks of work double pay. WhatI somehow feel this opportunity calling to me like I have to say yes. Whats that saying about when one door closes another opens Some bullshit like that. If it werent for the double pay I wouldnt look twice at it. But I would never see that kind of money working at Joes. Then again Joes is the stable kind of work Im required to have for my visa. I rack my brain pouring over different ways to do both. The countdown clock on the accept button is ticking. I dont have much time before this movie gig becomes a distant what if. Without wasting any more time I confirm my availability. After that only a few seconds go by before my stomach flips. What have I done Maybe I can fake sick take some vacation time at Joes while I play this out. Shane will cover for me. He always does. Besides...whats the worst that could happen xXxJosephineIm early. Again. The hustle and bustle of a movie set is usually too much for me at eight in the morningespecially since Im the lead actress. Everyone expects different things from me things I cant provide. A good day for me is one in which I can do my job interact as little as possible then leave. I try to be the person Hollywood wants me to be but my confidence is often misinterpreted as bitchiness. Thats the way it is now for leading women on the big screen. Thats also why I need this movie to go well...my PR representative says its my last chance to save my career. Walking along the nearempty studio lot in the mornings brings me a sense of peace. No paparazzi no screaming fans and no director to tell me to smile more. Just me my footsteps and a few pages of Wuthering Heights.My father always loved Bronte. Though Ive read the book cover to cover more times than I can count its one of the few memories I have left of my dad. Hed curl up with a cup of coffee and flip through the worn pages on weekends. Since he passed I made it a tradition to do the same. Youre here early. I whip my head around to see Khadija one of my only real friends in this industry. The young production assistant runs to catch up with me a tray of coffees in her hand. Figured Id get here before the circus begins. I joke. Do you need help carrying those The girl chuckles nervously and waves me off. No I got it. CharlieI mean Mr. Weberwould kill me if he found out I asked the lead actress to carry his coffee. Hes already on edge because of the new extras coming in tomorrow.I tuck my book into my purse grabbing two warm cups from her full tray. Hes just the director. He can fuck right off if he has a problem with it.A warm blush comes to Khadijas tan skin. Her brown eyes widen as she looks behind her making sure Charlie doesnt pop up behind her. I wish I had your confidence. She sighs. Maybe then I wouldve said something to the cute barista this morning.And I wish the rest of Hollywood could see it that way. I really am a nice person. I say under my breath so she doesnt hear. Im honored to be working on the same set as you. Khadija says with a grin. They say youre the next Angelina Jolie...at least thats what I read on Twitter. I try my best not to laugh at the comment. Well see what they think of me once this movie wraps. And thank you Im honored to have you as a friend. As we round the corner I see Charlies lexus pull into the lot. I can feel Khadijas anxiety spike when our boss spots half of his order in my hands. Dont worry. I assure her.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/32734090,Selkie Lay Back,Normally when you imagine a halfdrowned panicstricken person crawling out of the surf to frantically scrabble their way above the high tide line and collapse behind a rock you imagine someone nominally human. You know two arms two legs the works. You expect it to be after an unfortunate boating accident perhaps a wreck or even just a swimmer towed out by the rip tide and very happy to be back somewhere safe. You expect them to be returning to their home habitat to go about their lives after a period of recovery.Bug has like none of that.She has two arms sure but being as how shes a selkie she has a seal tail instead of proper legs and feet. There was no boating accident or swimming blunder. Shes not going back anywhere not if she can help it. Land isnt her home habitat and shes not particularly sure how shes gonna do a recovery on this.Finally the last of the water is out of her lungs and she looks up. The sky is the mottled orange and bluegreypinkred of sunset right after the clouds break from a storm and the wind still neargale strength even two days after the Category 5 ripped across Lake Michigan is already starting to dry her fur if only by straight up blowing the water off of her. Bugs eyes blink against the wind and fogginess in her face not used to being beached in anything but a nice calm day.So uh starts Bug before her vocal cords give out when another cough bubbles up. Uh huh. So what now No one answers not that she was expecting it. Fuck mmmm okay. Gotta... gotta do a thing. Imma just. Rest first. Yeah.Bug promptly passes out against her new friend Big Rock. The lake heaves. Bugs spent an unfortunate amount of time in Lake Superior better known in some of the more religious groups of selkies as Dread Mother Superior the much bigger much deeper and much much nastier neighbor of Calm Mother Michigan. Enough time to know the conditions that made her leave her pod in Dread Mother Superior the way in larger storms titanic waves would rip all the water from between them and drag any unfortunate object be they fish or selkie or ship miles across the lake bed mulched as good as any hand that goes too close to a ship propeller. Enough time to know that this is worse. She does what she always did with Dread Mother Superior takes as deep a breath as she can and dives takes shelter on the downstream side of a submerged stone pillar and gets ready to wait things out. She dozes in and out nostrils safely shut in her sleep until everything goes wrong. A topsider hover thingummy mustve slipped off a Fleet deck clips the top of her shelter as the waves start to bottom out less than a dozen meters up. The pillar cracks and that wouldve been it but the hover thingummy has snagged one of the skids and the added surface area acts like a nice big sail perfect for the waves to catch and pull. The tower comes down. Bug gets less than a second of warning enough to shove off tuck her head down and A topsider would likely compare the sensation to what they would imagine a nail would feel when struck firmly by a rather oversized hammer. All capacity for thought all sensation everything that makes Bug well Bug is whacked clean out of her. For a split second she just ceases to be replaced by a high velocity gummy bear with bones. As her vision pieces itself together and her eyes uncross she feels the distinct sensation of not being dead. As her mind comes back to her body she realizes that this might not be a good thing. The pillar has spiked her sideways deep into a crack between two stone outcrops previously hidden by lakebed muck. Shes wedged in a crack buried on the underside of a massive wall of rock in the middle of the biggest storm that can fit in Calm Mother Michigan and theres barely half an hours air left in her lungs. Shes going to drown. Shes a selkie selkies swim like topsiders walk and shes going to drown. Bug immediately starts clawing at the muck and rock around her sure she cant go up on account of the pillar but maybe sideways through the crack Fifteen minutes and Bug is no longer wedged but thats it shes too fucking fat to follow the crack as is and she doesnt have the time to dig it wider. Its hard to cry underwater but Bug is doing a pretty damn good job of it and she wants out so bad but shes not going to get out is she no shes going to The lakebed vibrates like a tuning fork. Something big is being bellydragged. Bug accidentally screams out the last of her air as something absurdly huge hits the pillar burying her at what must be close on to eighty miles an hour and blasts it away thundering overhead with all the danger of a storm in and of itself. The current made by its passing sends Bug spinning out of her mucky grave and as she pinwheels she sees the tail end of one of the huge Fleet liners retreat in the distance and there right there the shimmering glass of the surface Bug gets all of one short sharp gasp of air before the undertow drags her down. Shes working her way back up when Calm Mother Michigan decides its time for her to die. A Blooming Bell one of the huge jellyfish engineered by the Old Topsiders as combination food and chemical production plant is cast in front of her. And where one Bell blooms the rest are not far behind. Each one bigger and heavier than any two selkies combined with millions of hairy tendrils as long as any four and each and every tendril absolutely rammed with a cocktail of pharmaceuticals that will make you wish you were dead for about an hour before your wish comes true. One of Bugs podmates once asked a topsider what all was in those tendrils and not a single selkie was happy about the answer. The stingers nematoesites made caffeine capsaicin apitoxin and depending on the specific species poneratoxin batrachotoxin botulinum toxin or conotoxin. Chefs choice of so much pain you beg to die paralysis of your entire everything paralysis of your entire everything in the key of floppy or just fucking dying. Some whackjob scientist Old Topsider had been experimenting with gene splicing and decided it would be fun and also cool to make perfectly normal jellyfish be absurdly dangerous and also able to live in freshwater. Everything would have been fine but one of the first few big superstorms of the climate collapse washed the entire building into the river. The jellyfish did what jellyfish do and colonized everything downstream of that. Luckily for topsiders the jellies vastly prefer deep cold waters below where most food fish or selkies go so the risk of hauling one up is next to nil. Storms change that. The Blooming Bells are hauled up by wind and wave and there is one right. in. front. of her. Fuck getting more air shes got another twenty minutes and she prefers life thank you very much. She dives hard and fast. Once shes well out of range she looks up and Theres three more. Another wave passes and theres twelve. Theyre getting swept up and over her. Too many to count fast enough to matter. Another wave and theres hundreds. The flash of lightning overhead glows an eerie mottled pinkishgreenishgrey through more Blooming Bells than shes ever seen in her life combined. Bug presses herself against the lake bed in terror as her death roils a few dozen meters overhead. Five minutes and the Blooming Bells stretch as far as she can see. Ten minutes and shes starting to feel a little lightheaded but theres no end in sight and the waves are bottoming out even closer so theres no way for her to make a break for the edge. Fifteen minutes and lightning roars across the surface frying dozens of Blooming Bells straight to hell but Bug knows they dont lose their stings no matter how they die and shes running out of t i m e Twenty minutes and instinct dunks logic down long enough to send Bug towards the surface as fast as she can swim and shes out shes breathing air in her lungs and the black fog around her edges vanishes just in time for fire to lick its way across her arms and tail and back and body and head and face and e y e s The last thing Bug is aware of before her world ends in fire and pain is the fact that shes screaming. Bug wakes up screaming and whacks her head against the big rock she fell asleep behind and sure it wasnt Blooming Bells but ow. She opens her eyes again and...Hm.Well thats not great.Her vision is fogged all to hell in her right eye. Lefts not so bad she can still like see but.Oh.The stingers.Bug raises a trembling hand to her face and finds deep raw welts all across it. They mostly miss her left eye and her fur protected her from a lot of what didnt miss but the entire right side of her head is one big mess of painful soontoscar welts. Shes not bleeding but Bell stings never do. Usually whoever gets stung dies hard and fast but Bug and the other lucky ones she really doesnt feel lucky right now they scar up without losing a drop of blood.It takes a few purposeful wriggles and a good bit of galumphing to get to the water line but she does get there. She rinses her face as best she can and is going to actually go in and at least wash off but... stuck under rock under wave under Bells under water drowning dying d y i n g Bug shudders and wrestles her way back above the high tide line. The teaching songs rattle around in her head and usually theyre just addictive little bops of music but right now they feel like theyre discordant screaming warnings. Blooming Bells drift in from the east Waves carry them famine and feast with stingers in tow dealing death in one blow all schmucks that get close are deceased Yeah no no swimmies today thank you very much Bug whispers.Yeah shes gonna have to sort something out. Topside is uh not a great place to hang out longterm as a selkie. Too many hungry mouths on both two and four legs and a selkie only has the two limbs. So she needs to be off land but being underwater is a big nogo. Like nah. Ooh wait what was the rhyme if flippers be smote Find and float a big ol boat the lakes a moat so selkies coat wont start to bloat. Boat duh. The topsiders have that whole Fleet thing going on and theyre usually pretty chill about selkies maybe she can make a raft and go out to join up for a bit Weird the thought of being in water freaks Bug the fuck out but the whole being on water is fine. Whatever. If shes gonna get offshore before the local hungry things come poking around shed better hop to it.More like flop to it mutters Bug with a distracted and unfortunately soggy giggle before shaking her head firmly. No time for a gotdamn breakdown Buggiebutt you can cry your eyelids off once youre afloat. She scrabbles around the beach for a moment before finding it a nice heavy rock already worn smooth by the waves as rectangular as any wild rock can be and big enough she needs both hands to properly inspect it for cracks but not so big she cant hold it onehanded. She hauls herself over to the shore right up where the waves tickle the shingle beach and looks for an even bigger flat rock. Finding one she douses it sets her cobble at just the right angle and starts to grind.Oooooh round Cape Horn were bound to go timmie roodah roodah Round Cape Horn through the sleet and snow timmie roodah roodah day. Blow boys blow for Californio Theres plenty of gold so Ive been told on the banks of the SacramentoAfter all eighteen verses and all eighteen choruses she flips the now curved stone and starts over. By the time thats done Bug has a nice sturdy stone axe in hand and shes ready to make A Thing. Step one find one of those fuckoff huge bamboo tree stands that the Old Topsiders planted all over everywhere back before they realized that there wasnt enough land on earth to hold enough bamboo to sink enough carbon to stop the climate collapse.Oh hey theres one now.Step two cut the fuckers down. Step two sucks. Normally thered be like a whole pod working together to do this part but nope Bugs on her own. Fifteen minutes of twelve selkies whacking at bamboo becomes three and a half hours and by that point shes getting sick of The Banks Of The Sacramento so once the last tree comes down and shes had a chance to rest up she swaps songs.I dont know why I love you like I do All of the changes that you put me through. Take my money my cigarettes I havent seen the worst of it yet. I want to know that youll tell me I love to staaaaayBug decides to forego all pretense of being a normalass person and belts out the chorus at the top of her lungs.TAKE Me to the river DROP Me in the water PUSH me in the river DIP me in the waterAnd of course Bug forgets most of the next verse and just sings the chorus over and over again while using her axe to cut all the bamboo to length. It takes about fortythree poles per layer and it takes two layers to make sure the damn thing floats come hell or high water so thats like eighty six bamboo poles to cut. Then shes gotta strip the fibers and twist those into twine then braid twine into rope and thats entire fuckload of rope to be made. Fibertotwine cuts the length in half twinetorope cuts the length in thirds and she needs uh... three no four feet of rope per join along the edges as well as halfway down each pole for mmmm thats uh... 258 joins and mmmm 1032 feet of rope so 3096 feet of twine and uh 6192 feet of fiber. Each of the untrimmed bamboo trees is easily a hundred feet tall and is uhhh nine inches wide times pi for circumference is like 28 lengths of fiber per trunk so itll take two and a bit trees to get all of the fiber for rope.So yeah Bug gives up and goes to sleep up on top of the big rock until morning and its well into the afternoon the next day by the time she has enough rope to start putting her raft boat thing together. She has to sleep on the big rock yet again which is very stressful when theres not a whole pod keeping watch but by noon on the third day its ready. All thats left is a paddle and thats easy enough to make with some leftover twine the thinner top of a bamboo tree and a scrap of sheet metal washed up on the shore. Once thats done Bug waits for low tide then pushes the raft out as close as itll go to the water without floating off and drives a long bamboo stake into the sand as deep as itll go with the last of the rope and twine as a mooring line and climbs aboard. As the tide rolls in the mooring line holds steady against the waves shoving them ashore until finally it turns again late in the evening and Bug unties the line to let the waves haul them out.And with that the SS O Shit Waddup sets sail for the first time. If Bug has her way about it it may well be last too. Shes holding out hope for finding an actual proper built topsider rowboat or some shit even if the Fleet does turn her down.Ah well.Shell save that for later.,Not Rated,Bathophobiathalassophobiagraphic depiction of anxiety attackmermaid AU in fat seal flavorSelkiesthis is a healing fic but i specialize in writing trauma so read at your own riska good selkie is like a whale:an immovable mountain of fleshthat sings a lothowever selkies are not whalesthey choose to Cause Problems On Purposeso they sing nothing but earworms and weird shit
https://archiveofourown.org/works/43178277,The Rescue,The Kid Detectives Network Presents The Rescue August 18 2025. 400 PM EST. Phoenix Arizona. The footage starts with a Caucasian male sitting at an interview table silently reading through a large file in front of him. A tape recorder rests on the table next to him clearly going. Directly across from him is a lone figure left wrist wrapped in a makeshift cast. The figure has black ink red blood and green liquid staining their clothes and body yet they give no sign that they are bothered by the mess. Their tanned skin glistens with drying sweat from the heat of Arizona and their face is somber. Their dark brown hair is also similarly stained with the same liquids but their eyes Their eyes are pure white. They have no irises that can be seen but it is quite clear that they can still see. The pupils dart everywhere from the file to the interviewer to the camera recording every single moment that has happened in the room. The male sighs and starts speaking. FBI Agent Silverado speaking to a first hand witness about the socalled Afton Incident a 3 month long investigation into the return of famed serial killer William Afton. At this point in the investigation it is confirmed that Afton kidnapped 3 teen detectives from their hometown of Green Lawn Connecticut and brought them across several state lines in order to kill them. Afton is believed to have done this as a way of seeking revenge on... Agent Silverado checks his notes. ...the only survivors of the Fazbear killings and the members of the Missing Children Incident in 1985 Fritz Duncan Susan Susie Brooks Gabriel Pinto Cassidy Smith Jeremy FitzgeraldHathaway and Charlotte Charlie Emily his former business partner Henry Steinbeck Emily his three surviving children Micheal AftonBrooks Elizabeth AftonChambers and Norman Evan Christopher Afton and several other employees and coworkers that have yet to come forward. He closes the file with a snap and shuts his eyes sighing deeply. He opens his eyes again and looks at the figure across the table. Alright. Please introduce yourself and state your name for the record.The figure is silent for a moment their arms crossed over their chest as if they were nervous or tense or impatient or bored Im not going to say anything until I speak to my lawyer. The figure speaks calmly his voice carrying the slightest trace of an Italian accent yet buried under the crisp bite of his words. Agent Silverado looks at the figure. ...You are aware youre not in trouble right We all understand that you were just doing the right thing The door opens. A blacksuited male walks into the room briefcase in hand as he nods respectfully at the FBI Agent and the figure across from him. Good afternoon gentlemen. The newcomer says. My name is Isaac Lewis. Ill be representing my client here. The figure looks at Mr. Lewis gratefully as the lawyer sits down next to him. Agent Silverado looks between the two before he sighs and starts talking again. Once again could you state your name for the record The figure straightens in his seat and looks directly at Agent Silverado. Full name sir He asks.Yes full name please. The figure almost smiles white eyes glistening in the light. My name he practically purrs is Leroy Encyclopedia Scott Brown although you can call me Leroy. Im 16 years old.Agent Silverado knows who Encyclopedia Brown is by the way. Hell hes sure the entire world knows who these socalled Kid Detectives are. What hes trying to figure out is this it took the FBI plus a considerable amount of help and tips 23 months to track down Afton. How the HELL did a group of smalltown kid detectives from all over the world manage to track down and rescue three fellow kid detectives in LESS THAN A DAY ON THE SCENEHe forces himself out of his thoughts and looks at Leroy.Alright Leroy. Agent Silverado says. Why dont you tell me how this began.Leroy looks at him. ...how what began sir Agent Silverado blinks.Let me rephrase. He says formally. How were a group of smalltown kid detectives able to track down and rescue their friends inside of an entire dayHe might have let his annoyance with the whole situation slip through with that question. Leroy whos looking at him like hes the one being interviewed which is nothing short of terrifying because a literal teenager is looking at him like hes some sort of amusement just smiles.Lets see...

https://archiveofourown.org/works/35689690,Agatha Raisin and the Curious Cat,Agatha padded around the rented Chelsea flat. It was spacious and comfortable. One advantage she thought of having spent the early decades of her life working her ass off with very little regard for friends or distractions was that now when she needed money to throw around she had money to throw around. She took stock of her current circumstances. She had come to London to work a threemonth contract for Pebmens the firm she had sold her own PR agency to when she moved to the Cotswold. She had taken the contract mainly to get away from her neighbor James Lacey even though he was no longer in the Cotswold either having fled to Cypress leaving her in hospital and in a coma. She was not sure what she found more crushing the fact that he left her recovering from a head injury or that he went on what should have been their honeymoon. How could he be there without her How could he stand it Agatha couldnt imagine. Wouldnt he be thinking about her and how things might have been Sunbathing on golden beaches eating glorious food making passionate love the general euphoria of being with your new spouse of knowing with certainty there was someone for you in this world to share things with to count on DAMN HIM Agatha thought. She had come to London to get away from all of that to clear her head and if she knew what was best for her to get over James Lacey.Already attired in her bedclothes she poured herself a glass of wine and opened her laptop thinking she might look over the dossiers of her new clients. Just as she was settling in there was a knock on the front door. Agatha looked at the time on her laptop. It was after eight which was pretty late for a social call. It was probably Roy she thought. He was one of her few friends. He had worked for her for years at her PR agency although their true friendship had mainly struck up once she moved away from London. Somehow she had a London persona that didnt welcome others in and while she and Roy were mates in the Cotswold they were mainly colleagues in London.Agatha opened the door to a young girl perhaps in her early twenties perhaps late teens. The girl was about Agathas own height with light brown hair and piercing blue eyes. Her posture was stiff everything about her screamed of a nervous heightened emotional state. Mrs. Agatha Raisin the girl spoke in a small voice that was trying to sound big.Yes Agatha said still not opening the door all the way.Im Mira DeVere she girl said and waited for a reaction as though her name might explain her presence. I believe youre youre my mother.Agatha and the girl stared at each other for a long moment eyes large and mouths dropped.I think you better come inside Agatha said at last opening the door. They made their way into the living room. Agatha observed the girl standing before her. She seemed as though she dropped out of another era a Deborah Kerr or an Ingrid Bergman a young lady who would never presume to take a seat in someone elses home unless asked. Please sit Agatha said. II dont want anything from you. Perhaps I shouldnt have come Mira said sitting.Nono. Its alright Agatha said. Cant really derail my life much more than it already is she thought.I only came because I well for two reasons really. I was curious about you who you were what you look like mostly I suppose. I just wanted to meet you once in my life not to get anything from you. And because Mira said. I thought you might be curious about me too. I thought you might like to knowYou did the right thing. Everything worked out beautifully. If I could have chosen two people to be my parents I would have chosen Richard and Audrey. They gave me a fairytale childhood. Only not really since children in fairytales have dreadful childhoods. Mira rattled on nervously. But I mean if you ever wonderedWere a very happy family. But I suppose you must have known we would be since you chose them.No Agatha said. I just told the agency doing the adoption to choose whoever had been on the wait list the longest. I mostly tried to forget that whole part of my life. Im sorry that probably isnt what you wanted to hear. Its alright Mrs. Raisin Mira said with a soft understanding in her voice. I knew when I decided to try and meet you thatwhatever events lead a woman to place her child up for adoption might not be a comforting sort of story. Im sorry if Ive brought up painful memories.No not exactly. Agatha sat in the chair across from Mira. I tried to forget and just move forward but you cant can you Not completely. I would sometimes wonder if you were safe being cared for if the little cat had landed on its feet.I was always safe and well cared for Mira said. They began to talk a little about Agatha her life in the present about her PR work and moving to Carsley a little about the murders she had solved. She told Mira she had come to London for a few months after a bad break up. Finally as Mira was getting ready to leave she asked just one more question.Can you tell me anythingabout my father The agency who did the adoption has no information on him andhis name isnt on the birth certificate.Agatha thought about how to answer the girl and finally decided on You have a very big decision to make. I can either go to the kitchen and come back in with a pot of tea make up a pleasant story about your father and how everything happened. Or I can scour the cupboard for some hard liquor and give it to you straight.Mira appeared to consider these options. Her head tilted to one side and she squared her shoulders. For the first time Agatha saw a slight glimmer of herself in the girl. I want the truth.XxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXAgatha came to in her chair in the living room. She felt as though her head were in a vice and a skilled weight lifter were turning the screw. She looked over at Mira passed out of the couch. She went to the bathroom and took some aspirin and retrieved some for Mira. By the time she returned to the living room the girl was stirring.Here she said setting a glass of water and pills on the coffee table.Whats this Mira asked.Just aspirin Agatha said and Mira looked confused. Will it help with the headacheNot as much as youd hope Agatha said. Mira took the pills and swallowed a few gulps of water. Whats your hangover foodI dont know. Ive never been hungover before. Not like this anyway. Mira held the side of her head in her left hand.Never had a really proper hangover Agatha thought to herself. Who is this kid She cant possibly be my daughter.I tend to go for scrambled eggs Agatha said. Although thats probably because its the only thing I can make that has even a slight chance of turning out edible. Agatha went into the kitchen and made some scrambled eggs. In a few moments Mira joined her. Agatha put a small portion on a plate and placed them in front of Mira. Take a few bites if you can. Itll help. Mira did try but couldnt manage much. I really should go. Thank you Mrs. Raisin Mira said and Agatha was again amused by her good manners perhaps the boarding school Mira had so obviously attended had covered the correct way to wake up with a hangover in the home of your estranged biological mother but she doubted it.Alright then Agatha said. Mira nodded her head gingerly as it still felt as though a baby dragon might pop out of it at any moment. They walked through the living room. Im sorry if I said too much. Its a lot to know about Jimmy and me. They had been drinking which softened the blow of harsh reality but now Agatha regretted telling Mira everything. She had not held back Jimmys alcoholism his abuse. She had even told Mira that she never held her after she was born had not even known if she were a boy or a girl. The only thing she knew how to do at the time was keep moving forward and once she had decided on adoption for her unborn child she wanted it done quickly so that she could move on with the new plans and goals she had laid out for her life a life without Jimmy and without motherhood. No Im glad you told me. It doesnt change anything for me. I know who I am and where Im from. Thank you for being honest. Mira had her hand on the door knob. Something about seeing the girl there hand poised to open the door to leave Agathas flat and possibly her life forever prompted Agatha to speak again. ImuhIm glad you came round kid. They both allowed the word kid to hang in the air between them. Finally Agatha continued You know if youre ever in this neighborhoodyou couldPop by for a cup of tea Mira said turning from the door to look at Agatha her face brightening considerably given that her legs still felt like matchsticks and not proper legs.Or we could meet up for drinks sometime.Theres a pub just around the corner from here.Yeah its London. Theres a pub just round the corner from everywhere.Friday Mira asked.Sure. The Flag and LambYes Ill meet you there say half eight. See you then Mrs. RaisinAgatha Mira actually blushed as she said Agathas given name. And with that that the girl opened the door and left. And so Mira became a regular part of Agathas threemonth sojourn in London. They met for drinks had a movie marathon night each showing the other favorite films. They took a flight on the London Eye. They spent whole days together doing silly touristy things but only talking about their lives in the present tense. Agatha did not again bring up Jimmy and Mira did not speak about her parents or childhood. Agatha also did not introduce Mira to Roy or tell him about her. She also edited any mention of Mira out of her phone calls with Mrs. Bloxby. She learned from Mrs. Bloxby that James had returned to Carsley several weeks into her stay in London. She assumed that Mrs. Bloxby must have told James she was in London. She hoped that he would come looking for her breathlessly anticipated running into him around every corner but he never did. She gave very serious consideration to returning to Carsley just for a weekend just to check on things. He would see her car from the street and know she was home. He would rush to the door and knock loudly perhaps even call her name. And when she opened the door and he saw her he would know and he would tell her. Tell her that being apart from her had been hell. That his time in Cypress had only shown him how very much he loved her. He would wrap her in a passionate embrace. His lips would devour hers and thenAND THEN. But none of those things happened and rationally Agatha knew that they wouldnt. James never played the part she wanted never read the lines she had written for him. And shouldnt that tell her something.,Explicit,Not Found
https://archiveofourown.org/works/23638744,agatha raisin and the tempestous threesome,Its all Roys fault. A lot of things in Agathas life have been Roys fault. Her dreadful milestone birthday shes absolutely not going to think about which one because a lady never tells her age and shes not technically a lady but she still doesnt want to think about it the thing with the stripper and then the terrible Carsley School Gala which in hindsight was mostly her fault but shell easily blame Roy anyway. She loves him to pieces always has always will despite whatever gorgeous but shortlived men he brings home but a lot of things are his fault. Absolutely not. James says and is rather forceful about it. Agatha likes his forceful voice. Usually she doesnt take a lot of nonsense from men and their endless peacocking but she knows James and she knows that voice and sometimes that voice makes her feel things wholeheartedly inappropriate for the current discussion. Roy rolls his eyes. Boring. I think it could be quite fun. Charles interjects leaning gracefully on one side of her kitchen island a smug smile on his face. Hes always smug that man. Bloody men. Well you would. James continues. With all of your finangling. Finangling Charles replies still looking far far too amused. Youre twisting the definition there James and Id have thought Ladies. Roy interrupts. Were doing this for a reason. A good reason. Aggie I mean Agatha shrugs because shes not really upset about the idea of having two gorgeous men fawning over her no matter how fake it is. It is for a good cause Ugh. James throws up his hands and stalks out of the kitchen. Charles just remains staring at her for a moment. For the record I never had a problem with it. Smugly he wanders out of the room probably heading back off to his estate or something. Agatha huffs. Did you really think that would convince them Really Roy No Aggie I didnt think why dont you two join Aggie and form a polyamorous triad in order to infiltrate a poly commune thats suffered a handful of mysterious deaths would do it but what exactly would you have tried Roy asks pointedly. I did my best. Yes and I love you lots for it. Agatha replies only half seriously. Convincing James is not going to be easy. Why cant you just do it One because I have work. Roy replies Two because I absolutely do not want to pretend to be your lover even though I do love you. No thanks. Yuck. Should I be offended She replies though shes not. Absolutely not. Roy says Im just very very gay. If I was straight youd be the first woman Id go for. Im flattered Roy rolls his eyes. No respect honestly. Come on. Do you have any other ideas No. And thats the problem. Sundown is a commune somewhere in the rural depths of Ansborough. Theyve had a spate of deaths unknown mysterious deaths but they wont let the police in because of their strict adherence to a rule of threes every member of the commune must be in a polyamorous triad. It seems suspicious though all the deaths are of natural causes but... And then Roy had said I thought who do I know who has two hot men fawning over her a love for solving crimes and a track record of doing ridiculous things Thanks. Agatha had replied but shed been interested. The only problem is convincing James. Hes sulking outside the agency when she wanders outside looking rather putupon. Im not happy with this. He says and refuses to meet her eyes. Thats very him. She sighs and takes his arm. James nothing untoward is going to happen. You two have a history together. She laughs gently. James Charles has a history with almost every single woman in the area and probably some of the men too. Im living in sin with you remember You dont need to worry. Mhmm. He hmms but doesnt look convinced. Dont worry about it. James mightnt be keen on the idea but hes got good principles and as such Sunday morning finds them all jammed into a shabby little car Gem has good contacts even when shes not in town and well on their way to Sundown. Theyve all dressed down for the occasion. Its utterly bizarre to see the boys in jeans and tees and Agatha doesnt think shes worn anything so frumpy since she was a student. Roy had laughed. Repeatedly. And then hed said You do look the part. Born again middleaged hippi Shed threatened violence then and fortunately for him hed shut up. This is all rather common. Charles plucks at his tshirt a raggedy yellow one that James had provided from the back seat. If you dont like it James starts but Agatha swerves the car quite thoroughly to the edge of the median strip and he shuts up. This is going to be absolute hell and honestly Agathas fairly excited to see it. Sundown is surrounded by a shabby wooden fence that has daffodils along the border. The gate itself has Sundown painted on it in peeling yellow paint. There may even be a sun painted on there too. Agatha hates it immediately. Good morning sister Forrest who apparently is the defacto leader of the commune greets them with wide arms and welcoming eyes as she pulls the car into a spot next to several kombi vans. He kisses her on both cheeks and pats her thoroughly on the back. His beard is itchy. Shes not a fan. However because shes a professional private detective now or something she grins and bears it. ...Brother She replies. Its so good to finally meet you. Of course. Forrest chimes and proceeds to greet the men in the same way. Charles goes along with it of course. James looks a little like he wants to run away. Everyone is doing their daily activities right now but you will be able to meet them later. Forrest says and leads them and their bags Agatha had only packed one for their covers sake towards a set of small cabins. Theres about eight including one that is horrifically burnt out. Theirs is third from the left. Forrest unlocks the door and gives Agatha the key a thick metal sort shes not seen the likes of in years. He pushes the door open. The room itself gives Agatha pauses. There is only one bed. And not much else. Wheres the rest of it Someone voices her unanswered question and it takes her a moment brain reeling stupidly that its James. Forrest looks uncomfortable. Were only a small commune Brother I know you might have bigger facilities in the likes of London but Its lovely. Charles says beaming in a way thats only mostly a dig and pushes past them throwing his bag on the floor and flopping down on the bed. Come on my loves. Agatha pulls a face at him as she strides past Forrest and drags James along too. Thank you Forrest. We really appreciate this welcome to your little community. Well Ill leave you to get settled in. Forrest beams at the three of them all sitting on the bed. Theres a rough itinerary on the table but youre welcome to essentially do whatever you feel is calling you. Until next time Sister Brothers. He pulls the door shut behind him. At the very same moment James leaps off the bed and lurches towards the wall. He props himself up against it. Agatha takes the moment to take a proper look around the cabin. Aside from the overlarge bed theres a small kitchen made of rustic furnishings a table and three chairs and a door that presumably leads to some kind of bathroom. It could honestly be worse. Well this is rather quaint isnt it Charles says jovally obviously just doing it to be irritating. Id like the right side of the bed though I am rather partial to the middle. James clears his throat looking uncomfortable. He appears Agatha notes with some amusement to be turning an odd shade of grey. We have a case to solve. Can we discuss this later My compatriot is right. Charles says and shifts away from where hes leaning against her side. Who had the case details Compatriot James mutters but fossicks through his bag anyway. Allen Keynes his wife Samantha Keynes and their partner Lily Redford were the first to die. All in a tragic accident ingesting the wrong type of berry after a foraging expedition. The others the more recent case were Jane Henries Alexandra Jones and Kara St Lukes who had died after a mishap with their kitchens stove. It was all a bit fishy. Six deaths at the same commune within about three weeks Far too farfetched to be coincidence. Well Ill look into the stoves. James says just as the same time that Charles says Ill take the stoves. They stare at each other for a moment pensive. Agatha looks between them expectant. Shes not going to make any of their choices for them theyre grown men. Charles waves a hand at the other man. Youre handier you do it. Yes. James says slowly. I am. Great then Charles can find out about the poisonous berries and Ill talk to people. Agatha says Reconvene at uh Dinner time. James waves the brochure sitting on the table at them. 7pm in the Barn. Great Agatha says cheerily and hops off the bed. And remember if anyone asks were all madly in love James just grumbles as she walks past him and heads out into the commune proper. About five minutes later she really wishes she brought her wellies.,Teen And Up Audiences,Fake/Pretend RelationshipEnemies to Friends to LoversCase FicIT'S A FLIMSY PREMISE FOR A THREESOME

Judes family had been working for Antons family for many years and as his mother took care of Antons mother Jude cared for Anton. Jude raised an eyebrow in response to Antons call. Fetch me some water. As you wish. That was all Jude ever said to Anton. They werent friends just a rich boy and his servant but Jude loved Anton like a married man loves his spouse. He loved Anton like the sun loves the day and like the moon loves the night. Anton was Judes whole world and he looked at him like he hung the stars. As you wish. Was as close as he could get to say I love you for Jude. Anton felt it too. He was much more subtle about his love but he was falling with the handsome farm boy. He felt a bit guilty for not knowing his name but Farm Boy always answered him when he called. Anton felt like he couldnt live without his Farm Boy and not just because he was always around to fetch him things. Anton knew that the Farm Boy and he could never be together but he wanted it more than anything. Farmboy Jude turned back as he was about to leave the room. Anton had been unusually kind to him recently. Anton waved him closer and Jude complied. Anton pointed above his head to a pitcher he could clearly reach.

It was a memory that was both embarrassing and funny embarrassing when it happened but quite humorous in hindsight. Beru still remembered Ephyras confused look how her face turned redder with every single line she read and how she looked up at Berus face and asked Was that letter for Hector or MarinosHector Beru admitted and Ephyra breathed a sigh of relief.Beru bit her lip. Please dont tell himOf course not Ephyra promised. But if I were him Id fall in love with you immediately.Ephyra Beru shouted incapable of hiding her blush anymore.Now she whispered her sisters name again clung to the memory like it was the last thing she was allowed to remember. Ephyra.And the god inside her subdued. When I was nine I tried to uphold a little flower garden and was upset when all flowers withered away. Ephyra made them bloom for me. It wasnt the saddest and not the happiest memory at Berus disposal just one of the countless times her sister proved that she could use her powers for good that she could control them that she wasnt the danger her parents claimed she was.They had been right at the end but Beru still hold on to every single time Ephyra had proven them wrong every single time she didnt kill but gave life instead. Letting Berus flower garden bloom had been one of her greatest achievements back then because before shed only been able to revive a single flower at once a single precious life.Seeing Beru sad and disappointed had changed that. It had motivated her more than anything else. For Beru Ephyra had been able to do the seemingly impossible.Now with the god whispering in her ear Beru hoped she could do the same. When I was seven I found a bird with a broken wing beneath the acacia in the yard. I brought Ephyra to it and she healed it. It was the first life Ephyra had saved the first life that had been lost if it werent for her intervention. Back then Beru didnt even know if Ephyra would be able to heal the bird she just hoped it after seeing how shed healed cuts and bruises with a single wave of her hand. Thinking about it now about how the bird had hopped and flied away made Beru realize that Ephyra hadnt known it as well.She hadnt known the full extent of her power but for Beru she had tried to increase it determined to do everything to make her happy. She had been a child but that didnt stop her from trying out her fullest.Beru had to do it as well.Eighteen lives. She had doomed eighteen lives today more than Ephyra had killed during the four years of searching for Eleazars Chalice. Eighteen lives she wouldnt be able to save eighteen wings that would never heal.Beru closed her eyes and held back tears.She didnt have the right to cry.,Teen And Up Audiences,Book 3: Into the Dying LightCanon CompliantAlternative PerspectiveMissing SceneVignetteSnapshotsAngstDramaFearGrief/MourningGuiltProtectivenessTrustEstablished RelationshipFriendshipTeam as FamilyKissingProphecyFate & DestinySecretsLGBTQ Character
https://archiveofourown.org/works/35114968,Whatever It Takes,Whatever It Takes Chapter 1 Gone Anton was gone.At first Jude didnt realize it. He didnt want to realize it. Instead he looked and searched and used his Grace looking for a sign of him for any sign something that would lead him to the boy he loved.But when he found his scarf bright and blue and standing out against the Sacrificed Queens tomb his heart dropped into his gut and he couldnt breathe. No. It couldnt be. There was no way. Panicked Jude looked around as if he expected Anton to hide in the debris of the tomb. He didnt see him of course. Anton wasnt here just his scarf was. Unless A sick feeling twisted Judes stomach. What if he is hereBefore he knew what he was doing he began to dig Antons scarf clenched against his chest. Maybe he was buried here somewhere maybe the ceiling had crumbled down on him maybe Jude didnt want to think about the possibilities about Anton lying alone and helpless in the dark wounded and almost dead whispering for help whispering his name but not being heard. The image was so vivid Jude couldnt stop thinking about it. He had to save him. He had to protect him. Nothing else mattered.With the power of his reawakened Grace Jude dug himself between the rocks and the walls and the glass and the dust calling out for Anton again and again wanting him to know that he was here almost here just a few more minutes please Anton please be all right JudeJude winced so hard that he almost missed a pillar falling down on him shock and relief scurrying through his body until he heard his name again and disappointment settled in.That wasnt Antons voice. It was Hectors. In Judes desperate hope to find the former he had misheard the latter.Im here he cried hoping that Hector had the answer Jude hadnt but at the same time being afraid to hear it. What if hes But no he could not allow himself to think that. Anton wasnt dead. If he was Jude wouldve felt it. However he could still be at the brink of death badly wounded seconds away from collapsing seconds away from giving up Behezdas mercy Hectors voice interrupted his thoughts. I thought you were what are you doing He looked at the mess Jude had made turning around every stone and every brick in the sheer hope of finding another sign of Anton.I need your help Jude explained hastily. Maybe with the senses of two Graced Paladin they would be able to find him. I found Antons scarf a few minutes ago. He has to be here somewhere.Hectors expression derailed he stared at Jude as if he saw him for the first time. You havent found him yetIt probably wasnt meant to be an accusation but Jude felt strangely displayed like his own failures were looking back at him. No he replied curtly. Thats why I need your help.Hector didnt ask any more questions. He helped Jude in his search.In the ruins they met Prince Hassan looking as appalled as Jude felt. There was a dark glimmer in his eyes as if he witnessed something that was too terrible to name too terrible to even think about. He joined their search but he didnt show the same resolve Jude and Hector did no he seemed hopeless as if he was looking for a body and not a person a person Jude couldnt bear to lose a person that had to be alive he just had to Jude Hector said after what felt like a few hours Hes not here Jude.He didnt say it but Jude knew what he thought. Hes not dead he said with a trembling voice. I knew if he was.Hector didnt say anything. Instead Hassan spoke out.But where is he he asked. If he isnt dead shouldnt we found him by now Shouldnt we found him regardlessJude gave him a glaring look. Thats what were doing right now he said slowly. Were finding him.Hector and Hassan exchanged a telling look.Jude Hector said carefully and Jude hated the way his best friend looked at him full of pity full of sorrow.What he hissed not wanting to hear it.Hector inhaled deeply. I dont think he is coming back.Jude stiffened. What do you meanIt was Hassan who answered. Hes Hes dead isnt heIt didnt really sound like a question.Judes lungs contracted. He felt like suffocating like Hassans words were too much to swallow too much to accept. He refused to look at him but focused on Hector instead. Hes not dead.Hector looked like Jude was made of glass and he was afraid to break him. Jude thought he might as well could.Weve been searching for hours Hector said. And we havent found him. I dont even feel him. Do youJude hadnt used his Grace yet and now he realized why. He was afraid of it. Afraid it would tell him the same as Hector and Hassan afraid he wouldnt hear any sign of a living being.He didnt answer.I think we should go back to Tel Amot Hassan chimed in. If the Prophet survived and isnt here he might have gone there.But why would he leave us Leave me Jude wanted to ask. At the same time he couldnt argue with Hassans reasoning. Anton wasnt here. That was a simple fact. So he had to be elsewhere. And Tel Amot was their best guess.Fine Jude said finally. Were going back.Once again Hector and Hassan exchanged a look a look Jude didnt like at all. They had made up their mind he realized. They didnt believe Anton was in Tel Amot. They just acted this way because they didnt want to search for him any longer. They had given up.It made Jude sick to think about it. Hes not dead. But on the road to Tel Amot doubts overcame him. He reached for Antons scarf. Why would he leave it behind if he was alive Did he lose it and didnt bother to look Did he trust Jude to pick it up for him to take care of it Or was there another reason he didnt return a reason Jude didnt want to think about a reason so horrible that even considering it made his stomach turn upside downI would know he reminded himself. He is alive. He is alive. He is alive.He repeated the words like a mantra like a spell as if thinking them often enough would make them come true. They had to be true. There was simply no other option. Jude couldnt lose Anton. He just couldnt.Inhaling deeply Jude locked up any doubts he had any questions and any suggestions anything that wanted to convince him that Anton wasnt here anymore. Because he was. Just because he hadnt found him just because hed only found his scarf didnt mean that Anton had been killed.And yet out of all the doubts and questions and suggestions one slipped through the cracks What if Im wrong Quickly he shoved the thought away but it kept coming back encouraged by every gaze Hector and Hassan exchanged with him any gaze that questioned his decision. What if Im wrong He wasnt wrong and he knew it he felt it but the evidence spoke against him. And that made it so much harder to believe in himself in Anton in their intertwined fate. The prophecy had brought them together but what if it was also meant to break them apart What if Antons life was the sacrifice he had to make the one thing that could stop the Age of DarknessJude gulped. No.He wouldnt allow these feelings to overwhelm him any longer. Anton wasnt in Tel Amot.Judes heart tightened thudding against his chest and he couldnt breathe.Anton wasnt here. He had never been. Judes hope had been just that A futile hope to find him again to hold him in his arms to put a soft kiss on his lips. But he wasnt here. He didnt wait for Jude didnt greet him with a cheeky smile didnt ask for his blue scarf.Because he wasnt there.Hector put a hand on his shoulder a surprisingly intimate gesture and Jude nodded thankfully. Wherever Anton was Hector would support him. Together they would search for him. Together they would find him.But then Hector said Im sorry Jude. I know he meant a lot to you.Taken aback Jude jerked away. What do you mean he asked with a frosty voice. Hes alive. He just isnt here.He couldnt stand the pity in Hectors eyes.Jude Hector said slowly and Jude already knew that he wouldnt like what his friend had to say you heard what she said. And if he were really alive dont you think he wouldve scried for us Scried for you Dont you think he wouldve tried absolutely everything in order to find youYes Jude thought but instead of saying it he defended Antons inaction Maybe he got imprisoned. Maybe he cant reach out for us as much as he wants to. It was the most likely explanation. It wasnt an explanation Jude liked but it was still better than the alternative.Hector didnt respond.Jude felt his anger rising so he changed the topic. Wheres Hassan He wanted to look for a tavern. They needed a place to stay at so Hassan had volunteered to get them one. It was a little risky to put the Prince of Herat in such a situation but Jude trusted him enough to let him handle it alone.Ill look for him Hector volunteered. Jude wondered if his friend was genuinely looking for Hassan or wanted to get away from him as fast as possible.Once again Jude looked at the bounty hunters office Antons scarf clutched against his heart.Your friend he heard the bounty hunters voice is dead.He swallowed hard tried to find an explanation. The bounty hunter a girl named Fatima had claimed that she didnt feel Antons esha anymore that it had left the world. And Jude had stared at her disbelieving her words not reaching him not really. Your friend is dead.It cant be Jude thought. He cant be dead. He just cant.Was there a way to hide someones esha A way to make it impossible to find Jude didnt know but it seemed plausible. After all Anton was the Prophet. He could do anything if he really wanted to.But a stubborn little voice in his mind whispered why would he hide from youJude didnt have an answer. Unless He looked at the bounty hunters office again. She was a cheap one worth a dozen Virtues but not much more. The most likely reason was her lack of reliability Jude thought. Not all bounty hunters were worth the same. Some were naturally better than others just like other professions offered different kinds of talented people. Could it be that he had stumbled upon an amateur Maybe even an impostor It would be a very unlucky coincidence but it wasnt impossible.He had to hire another one. A better one. One that could actually tell him where Anton was.Satisfied with his conclusion he went off to find Hector and Hassan. As much as he wanted to find Anton he had to accept that he wouldnt do it today. He was tired exhausted from their journey he didnt know any other bounty hunters or how he would pay them and he also didnt want to worry Hector and Hassan in case they wondered where he was.One night Jude told himself. Please hold on for a single night Anton.Wherever Anton was wherever he waited for him Jude hoped he would hold on just a little while longer until he had the means to help him properly. Tomorrow. That was the deadline Jude set for himself. Being apart from Anton for so long was like missing his reflection something he took for granted until it disappeared and left nothing but a hole in his heart. He had to find him soon for both his and Antons sake.And then Jude would say the words that burned on his tongue the words he had wanted to tell Anton since the first kiss they shared words he never uttered out loud before.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/34705672,There Will Come A Darkness | AFTG AU,ANDREW Before him knelt a priest begging for his life. They were in a moonlit room one that gave a perfect view of the City of Faith. I swear it I wont hurt them anymore. Have mercy I will repent. He cried hands reaching for Andrews boots. He crushed them beneath his feet satisfied by the crunch that followed. Something like rage swirled beneath his skin a deep emotion. The kind that he only felt on nights like these. They always said this. They always made these useless promises he knew they would never keep them. Their urge to continue in their deeds to sate their desires it was stronger than whatever fear he might instill in them. They always thought that if they begged he would show them mercy. But when their victims begged they had none to give. They were the true monsters in this world he was merely ridding it of them. And yet I wonder what you said to them as you left bruises along their skin. The room around them was in disarray. When he had stepped in quiet as a ghost there had been two girls with him wrists red and expressions blank. They had fled the minute hed grabbed the priest. Please I beg of you. Show me mercy He repeated. Andrew felt the anger grow. I do not like that word. People like you should not be making demands. He reprimanded. Like a switch the priests expression changed his words became sharper. You think you are a god you think you have the right to take lives. He snarled. You are a monster. How funny the monster was calling him one. Hes sure his victims would sorely disagree. He reached out a hand placed it on the priests cheek lightly. Something like relief made its way onto his face and Andrew nearly laughed at his ignorance. He placed a finger beneath his chin lifting it. Something must have shown in his eyes for the terror to flash in the priests eyes like it did. You have been marked for death and death has come to collect. He said almost a whisper. His hand slid to his throat and he could feel his rapid pulse beneath his finger. He focused on the rushing blood and he drew the esha from him. He watched with vague interest as he spluttered out his last breaths and collapsed on the ground lifeless. With only a pale handprint against his throat to show for it. He unsheaths one of his many daggers and he presses it on the handprint drawing a line of blood. Flipping it over he opened the compartment at drew out the vial within before he uncapped the it and raised it towards the line of blood. The reason he killed wasnt for justice wasnt because of the victims. The reason he killed was far more selfish. But he couldnt find it in himself to care much all that mattered to him was survival. The reason he chose his targets however were far more noble if you could call it that seeing as it was a twisted sort of closure for him. A way to come to terms with what he had lost. He stands from the body and frowns at the splatter of blood that stained his gloves. How tiresome. A door opens startling him. He fumbles with the vial and it nearly cracks open on the ground but he catches it. He turns to the door and finds three men at the entryway. Dont move One held a crossbow the others sabers. Sentry. Because of course they were. He shouldnt be surprised given how close he was to the High City gates. Thalassa sat at the edge of Elea Square which was just withing the gates of the city. The first Sentry stopped gaping at the body in horror and surprise. Hes dead He gasped out. Great observation. Andrew nearly drawled sarcastically as he rolled his eyes. He reached up a hand fastening the black silk that covered the bottom of his face then fingered his hood. Give up come with us at once and nobody else has to get hurt. One of them barked trying to sound soothing. Andrew rolled his eyes again. He had no trouble keeping his voice bored and uninterested. You take another step and there will be three more bodies in this room before dawn. One paled Hes bluffing. Another Crossbow stood firm though his arms shook. He is not. Andrew raised a brow then jerked a head towards him minutely as if to say listen to that guy. If seemed the gesture angered the Sentry. Ah well. Wait One yells. The one whod frozen at the door. Look at the print on his neck its a hand. The two others pale Crossbows hands shake some more. The Pale Hand. He whispered in reverence. He hated the name but it wasnt like he could publicly announce how foolish he thought it sounded. Like some wannabe villain. No one is so powerful they can kill with only the Grace of Blood. One says but the trembled in his voice is a dead giveaway for his true fear. It is true most people couldnt. But he wasnt most people. He was no healer either. What is your business with Pallas Athos Why here The third asks as if staring at a fearsome creature. Andrew supposed they thought him one. You call this place the City of Faith. He says slowly deliberately. He wants them to listen to what he says. But corruption has been so deeply ingrained in these whit walls. Evil lurks at every corner. I will mark them the way I do my victims so everyone may see the City of Faith is now the City of the Fallen. This was obviously a lie. He cared not what happened to or in this city. He had only one concern one priority. He had no noble goals he didnt kill for a cause. But having people believe so made what he did easier. It deterred suspicion from him. Not the Pale Hand him. But only two knew thisthe other was waiting for him to return. He moved towards the window and no one moved to stop him despite tensing and taking stances. You cannot hope that killing a priest would be so easy you cannot think we wont tell the Conclave Then tell them. He said they paused. Tell them the Pale Hand has claimed a priest of Pallas. He dared. And tell them to pray they are not next. He was poking a sleeping bear dancing with danger. He turns to the balcony throws open the satin drapes and he ran to the edge as they yelled at him. He climbed over the balustrade and left towards the roof of the public bath to the left. He squeezed his eyes shut as he tucked in his knees and braced for impact. His fear of height stupid as it was did not help in the slightest. He fell into a roll and waited for his momentum to slow before picking himself off and racing across it letting the shouts of the Sentry and the lights of Thalassa fade behind him with a singular goal in mind. Andrew moved quietly through the mausoleum having perfected his stealth ages ago. The sanctum was deathly quiet as it was atill dark. He picked his way through broken marble and other rubble around the tiled scrying pool in the centre it was the only part of the shrine left untouched. The caved in roof above him left the sky visible. The ruins sat just outside the High City close enough for him to easily sneak into the Low City if need be without drawing notice. He didnt know much about how it got like this but it was now abandoned and gave him the privacy they needed. He slipped through the scorched shrine and into the crypt. The stairwell made sn awful lot of unpleasant noise as he creeped down and wrenched open the rotten door of the alcove theyd been calling home for a few weeks now. He shed his hood and mask as he crept in. This alcove has once been for the acolytes that tended the shrine. Now it was left for the rats and other unpleasantries that Andrew didnt mind much especially not when it provided them shelter. Youre late. Andrew resists the urge to roll his eyes. Grumpy as ever. He peered through the darkened room at the bed that lay in the corner. His brothers golden ones stared back. He discards his hood and mask carelessly. I know. A book slid from Aarons chest as he slowly sat up his pale hair flying all over the place. Did everything go okay He asked with a worried tinge in his voice. Fine. He replied curtly. He saw no point in mentioning the Sentry given how hed managed to get away. And you dont want to worry him a small traitorous part of his brain screamed at him. He ignored it. When hed first started at the tender age of thirteen he wasnt as good as he was now at slipping into places unattended. His Grace wasnt meant for that. Hed had to cultivate that skill over years of work and hed nearly died as a result. Back then telling Aaron about it was something to laugh about. Now they rarely laughed especially not with each other. Now they barely even talked. Back then when Aaron was well enough hed followed Andrew and theyd raced each other. Tailing their targets stealing from others it had trained them. Now after all of it Andrew was near perfect at what he did and knew exactly how to get himself out of tough spots. Andrew saw the pain in his brother his twins eyes and his mood soured. This was the reason he did this. Not for justice not because he liked killing not for any rush of adrenaline. He killed for his survival. Come on. He grunted. Aaron shifted his sheets off his body and he was shaken beneath them his skin ashy. His eyes were severely bloodshot and tired lines were etched beneath them. He frowned a little as he stared at the pitiful sight before him. He reaches for the shallow bowl beside the bed and empties the contents of the vial into this. We let it get too bad. He says softly. Its fine. Aaron hissed through his pain. Im fine. Andrew raised a brow. Agree to disagree. There is an undercurrent of guilt that Aaron knows not of. He had sworn to protect him hed ensured that hed survive. He wouldnt fail him never again. Aaron unwrapped the cotton on his left wrist revealing the black handprint marring the skin below. Andrew pressed his hand to the bowl wetting it with the blood if the priest. He raises said hand and pressed the bloody palm above the black print. He closed his eyes and focused on the blood guiding the esha hed stolen from the priest into his brother. The blood he took for his victims acted as a conduit for the esha he drained from them. If he were a trained healer he would know the proper bindings that would tether the esha he took from his victims to Aaron. He wouldnt have any need for the blood. But then again if he were trained he wouldnt kill in the first place. Healers with the Grace of Blood took an oath preventing them from drawing esha from people. But it was the only way to keep Aaron alive to fulfill his promise. There. All better. He muttered eyeing Aarons skin as it begun to lose its grayish tinge. For now. Aaron muttered. Andrew glared sharply at him. Yes Aaron would get worse. Its as inevitable. But he was working on it. And he would kill whoever stood in his way no matter what. For his brother. He watched with derision as Aaron draws out a black stylus carefully from the drawer of the table beside the bed and draws a line of his wrist joining it to thirteen others. Permanently etched in alchemical ink. Fourteen people killed. Fourteen people Andrew could care less about as long as Aaron could live. Andrew noticed the way Aaron meticulously marked his skin each time he claimed a victim. A sign of misplaced guilt. His victims deserved it and Aaron got to survive. It was enough to him. But for some reason Aaron expected remorse from him for taking lives remorse he could not give. Something he despised him for. This could be the last time I do this. He whispered. Because despite how much he insisted he was fine with Aaron despising him so long as he let him continue to heal him he also cannot help but think back to the very beginning. Before the guilt wore down on Aaron before they became this. Aaron looked away. At least I tried. This this way the true reason theyd come to Pallas Athos. There was somebody someone here who knew a way to heal Aaron for good. Who knew how to end the killings. Who knew how to put a stop to the four years theyd spent like this. And they could finally be free. Im going to make sure nothing happens to you. Im going to protect you. He says for what feels like the hundredth time. Hed sworn it then hed swear it again no matter how many times he had to. I know. That is all you ever do. Protect me. Aaron responded almost bitterly. Andrew sighed. Go to sleep. He says firmly and Aaron complies rolling over and offering a space. But Andrew had not willingly slept in the same bed as another person in years. He wouldnt start now. He sits in the corner and he watches Aaron. He listens to his breathing somewhat uneven and he thinks. Each time he drew the esha from his victim he felt relief. But he also felt fear. That he was turning into the very same monsters he was ridding the world of.,Mature,Alternate Universe - FantasyThe Age of Darkness AUA Truly Niche AUHealer!Andrewkind ofBloodDeathImplied/Referenced Rape/Non-conRevengeNo Prior Knowledge of TAD Required
https://archiveofourown.org/works/34096480,Not Our Fate,Chapter 1 The Last Prophet You dont believe its Hector but you still want it to be him.Its such a selfish thought a thought you are not allowed to speak out loud but a thought that stays with you throughout the years. Maybe its because you love him. Maybe its because he doesnt love you.Or maybe its because you are drawn to the things you cannot have.You dont know. It doesnt matter. Because it doesnt change the fact that you believe in it with all your heart and soul.You will become the Keeper of the Word one day. You will serve the Prophet and guide them in their quest to save the world. But helping them means leaving everyone behind including Hector and you cant possibly imagine living without him.So Hector has to be the Prophet. Its the only solution you have. The only solution that wont separate you forever.Every night you pray Please. Let it be him. And every night you know very well that the Prophets wouldnt possibly align someone you love to the fate that lies in front of you. It would be too distracting. It already is. So Hector cannot be the Prophet no matter how much you want him to be.The thought crushes your soul. You dont want it to be true. You dont want to leave Hector behind. But deep down you know there is no other choice. You need to prepare for a future without him no matter how impossible it sounds. Someone with a Grace is the Prophet someone you will serve until the day you die.But that someone wont be Hector. When you were eight you asked your father How will we know who it is impatient to know whom you will serve with the Grace you were training day and night.Your father looked at you and explained that theres a prophecy multiple ones in fact. A prophecy by the Prophets which only revealed that the Last Prophet has a Grace and another one by Vasili a prophecy the Order doesnt talk about because it was made when he was already insane. You look it up and frown. Your father reassures you Its not true. We wont know who the Last Prophet will be but you will feel it.You didnt understand. You still dont. But your father believed in you so you try to believe in yourself as well. You will recognize the Prophet even though you dont know how. Somehow you will see your bond will know who the right person is.You want Hector to be the right person.Staying by his side feels completely right but you doubt this is the feeling your father meant. After all you know what its origin is. You know why being with Hector makes your heart flutter why being with him drowns every other thought.You know but it isnt until you are sixteen that you can finally admit it to yourself.You love him.And you would always choose him above the Prophet. The Prophet.You dont believe its Hassan but the others do so you keep quiet and observe him try to find the truth your unbreakable connection. You didnt feel it when you met and you dont feel it now but that doesnt have to mean a thing. Because his powers havent awaken yet because he isnt quite ready to embrace his role. Or at least thats the explanation you give to yourself.From what you can tell the Prince is nice and caring responsible and determined to save everyone he can. He will soon learn that you can never save everyone that someone he cares about will die without a way to prevent it.Its the fate that awaits everyone foolish enough to believe otherwise.But you still admire him for caring so much about his people for being a prince who needs them rather than someone who exploits their trust. You admire him for caring.But you dont care about him.Hes certainly sympathetic even friendly but he is no match compared to Hector. Choosing between him and your best friend isnt a choice at all.You almost feel sorry for him until you remember that you dont have to be. Because deep down you already now The Paladin are wrong. This isnt the person theyve been waiting for. This isnt the savior of the world.But he has to be somebody and being the Last Prophet is the role that harms the least so you swallow your doubts and hope you will feel your connection soon. And then everything turns upside down when you and Hector find Ephyra the Pale Hand the person who murdered his family. Finally you learn about Hectors past about his losses and his nightmares about everything that haunted him since you first met. You had no idea about any of it and it shocks you just how much you missed about your best friends life.What will you do you ask him and pray the answer isnt what you fear it will be.Hector avoids your gaze but he answers and sure enough its not an answer you wanted to hear.I dont know.You hear him swallow hear him struggle hear him battle inside his mind. Both of you know what Hector is supposed to do how he is supposed to treat Ephyra and what he is supposed to say to the Order.But both of you know that Hector wont do any of it. Forgiving. Letting go. Focusing on the future. These principles are easy enough to follow when you are convinced you wont ever confront your past again but when you do its almost impossible to follow these simply set of rules.You want to support Hector want to tell him that hell succeed but the words die before they even leave your mouth. They wont help. No words will help. Hector has to make this decision for himself and you have to trust him to make the right one.But if youre completely honest with yourself you arent sure if you trust him. You arent sure of anything. Not even of your duty the one thing you are supposed to believe in. Protecting the Prophet. This is your goal. Your future and your purpose. Its short and simple easy to understand but definitely not easy to do.Especially when everything you think about is Hector.You swallow let him think hope he makes the right choice. You have to talk to Hassan have to make sure the Order made the right choice as well. We wont know who the Last Prophet will be but you will feel it.But you dont. You arent sure at all. And ironically enough talking with the Prince makes this feeling even worse.He seems to be a good person someone worthy enough to be the savior of his people the savior of the whole world. He knows how much his destiny weighs how many lives he could destroy or save with a few words. Those are certainly good qualities for the Last Prophet but But Its not him. You feel it. You know it. Prince Hassan might be the perfect candidate for the Order of the Last Light but hes not the one destined to stay by your side.Because this place is already occupied by someone else.You feel Penroses wary look but you ignore it and go to Hectors room not because you need to but because you want it. You shouldnt want it.Hector is not inside.You freeze. No.Because you know where he is. Where he must have gone. Where hes not supposed to be.Jude Penrose asks and says something about Hassan having a vision in his dream something that sounds so ridiculous that you almost want to laugh. You dont though. Your smile died the minute you entered Hectors empty room.I need to find Hector you say fully knowing what this means even if Hassan turns out to be nothing more than a prince with too much hope.Because choosing between him and your best friend isnt a choice at all. You dont believe its Ephyra but she might as well be more than she is willing to admit.She denies being the Pale Hand claims that Hector made a mistake but she doesnt know that your Grace of Heart catches every single lie. Shes afraid shes horrified and she begs you to help her sister Beru.Shes innocent she says the first truth spoken in your conversation. She has done nothing wrong.You ask where Hector is and Ephyra hesitates. Ill tell you if you promise me one thing that youll protect my sister.You promise it but this is not good enough for her. Swear it she demands. Just like you swore to uphold your oath.You want to refuse want to tell her that protecting her sister cant possibly compare to protecting the Last Prophet but of course you already proved that you care more about Hector than anyone else.You agree.Ephyra looks at you and nods. You earned her trust her approval and she believes your word because she knows you wont ever break it. She tells you where Hector is.Without hesitation you call your Grace perform a koah then another and another until you have enough agility and speed to hopefully catch up with him.Then you run as if your life depends on it because it does.Because your life will never be the same without Hector by your side. You confront him your best friend your secret love the most important person in your life. You talk to him beg him to return to the Order to return to you but Hector does not listen.I have to do this he explains but you dont understand. They destroyed my life. You have to let me go.I cant you whisper and everything you ever felt for Hector echoes in these two words your love and hope and broken faith your longing and betrayal your friendship that is about to end for good.Hector stares at you in disbelief and you immediately regret showing him the truth inside your heart. You hoped it would make him stay but now you realize that it was the worst mistake you couldve done.Hector opens his mouth clearly wants to say something but before he has the chance the roof under you crumbles you lose your balance and then you fall.You fall into the darkness. You wake up your whole body hurts and you are not alone.A boy offers you his help his freckles spread across his face like stars. You dont know him have no idea why he wants to help but you need it so you accept it reluctantly.He carries you outside and you suppress a painful cry. When you leave the crypt you almost cant believe that the world is still the same. Your whole world shattered into a million pieces so how can everything else just continue like before It doesnt make any sense at least not in your current state.Are you all right the boy asks. You press your lips together and dont answer.Ill get a healer the boy continues. Can you stay here until then He points to a fountain nearby. You hesitate. The boy will probably take off as soon as he leaves your field of vision but its not like you have another choice.All right you agree. Ill wait for you. You dont believe he will return. Still when he turns and is about to go you cant help but ask What is your name It just occurred to you that you dont know.The boy smiles. He has dimples. Then he says My name is Anton. What about youYou should lie should protect your identity and the Orders plans but when you speak its the truth that leaves your mouth.Jude you say. Jude Weatherbourne.And thus your bond is forged. You dont believe its Anton but you cant help but wonder if its him regardless. Why else would fate tie you together Why else would your paths cross just after Hector left You cant think of an explanation that doesnt immediately make him one of the most important people in your life.You lean by the fountain wait for his return while people pass and barely grant you more than a glance. You dont care. They might as well not exist at all because everything that mattered stopped existing after Hectors betrayal. You dont care about these people you dont even care about Anton. Hector is the only one who inhabits your mind.But when he returns a healer by his side your heart skips a beat and you dont know what to think. You didnt expect him to return let alone with a healer but he kept his promise proved that he is more than boy on the street trying to survive.While the healer helps you get up Anton offers you something to eat sweet pastries. Youve never eaten sweet pastries before. Hesitantly you take them take a bite.They are delicious.Anton smiles as he notices your gaze and you dont know what to say so you stay quiet. You should thank him for taking care of you a stranger but you cant bring yourself to speak the words.You dont know what hes hoping to get out of it.His behavior is so strange. The healers help doesnt surprise you because it is his job but Anton doesnt owe you anything. You dont know each other. You dont trust each other.Except you already did.The healer takes you to a tavern and Anton follows you. Inside it is loud and crowdy the smell of alcohol saturates the air. It is so overwhelming that you hold your breath without even realizing it. The healer carries you upstairs to a lonely room where nobody can disturb you for better and for worse.Its Anton who gathers your belongings your cloak your sword and even your torc. Normally you never wouldve trusted anyone except the Order to take care of them but you are hurt and exhausted and too tired to think.You close your eyes and trust both Anton and the healer to take care of you and the things you value the most.But deep down the real reason for your naive trust comes to the surface Since you already lost Hector the person you love the most you dont care about losing anything else.Because nothing could ever compare to losing him. You wake up and for a first few precious moments you dont remember anything. You dont know where you are and you dont know how you got here. But then everything rushes back and you immediately try to get up. It hurts and you suppress a painful groan.Easy there youre going to get yourself hurt.You tilt your head even though you already recognized Antons voice. He sits on a chair next to your bed your belongings on his lap. It bothers you how casually it looks like its completely normal for him to take care of the things you value more than your life. And certainly more than his.I cant get hurt more than I already am you reply dryly. You dont explain why because you dont need to.Oh Anton says. The word is like an arrow splitting your heart in two. Loved him that much huhYou avoid his gaze and dont reply. Because you dont need to. You already showed him what your feelings are. You dont need to speak them out loud.What are you going to do now Anton asks quietly.You dont even look at him. Im going to find him of course.HowYou hesitate. If youre completely honest you havent thought about it for a single second. You dont know where Hector is. He is your best friend the person you love and yet you dont know him enough to determine where he could be.Anton notices your reaction of course. In a casual tone he offers I could help you find him.You jump up. What HowAnton rises up a bit to look you in the eyes. I have the Grace of Sight. I can find everything and everyone.Your heart skips a beat. I can find everything and everyone. Its an offer you didnt expect an offer too good to be true. You lower your eyebrows. It is too good to be true. What do you want in return you ask.Anton tells you. You freeze and stare at him.But you still agree. You never believed it was you.Maybe because you were raised to be the Last Prophets Keeper maybe because you never learned to believe in yourself. But you always saw yourself as the person supposed to protect the Prophet and never as the person who needed that protection.After accepting Antons offer you wonder if youll need it.Once you know who it is you will protect the Last Prophet with everything you have. But who will be protecting youAnother reason to find Hector another reason to leave everything behind. Youre making a mistake and you know it you feel it in your bones but every mistake is worth making if it leads you to your best friend and secret love.The next day you and Anton say goodbye to the healer and his husband looking for a way to leave the city without attracting unwanted attention. With a heavy heart you decided against wearing your blue cloak. The Paladin surely are searching for you now roaming the harbors and the streets probably already equipped with the weapon that will end your life. You cannot let yourself be seen you cannot risk getting caught. And even though you are not so easily recognizable anymore you look around constantly your heart pounds in your chest its beat echoing in your ears. But the only glance you notice is Antons.Are you being followed he eventually asks. That was a rhetorical question by the way.Then why are you asking you snap.Anton raises his hands eyes so innocent and big that you are sincerely irritated. Easy there. I was just asking. It doesnt help any of us if we are being chased by some dangerous Witnesses.You stop in the middle of the step stare at him and dont know what to say. You didnt even consider how your behavior must look from Antons perspective. Of course he would be suspicious of course he would ask about a past you are not allowed to share. He doesnt know anything about the Order or the prophecy or the Age of Darkness. He is just a boy a random citizen a short encounter.We are not being chased by the Witnesses you say slowly. Anton looks at you questioningly but you dont say any more are not ready to say more. You feel like you already revealed too much not with your words but with your actions with all the subtle movements Anton currently observes. His gaze feels so intense and intimate like he not only gazes at your body but your soul at all the secrets you keep hidden inside your heart.He doesnt ask but accepts your silence and you stare at him in disbelief. Anton trusts you. He doesnt know you not really but he still gives you his trust something so precious that not even the Paladin share it willingly.Trust.You trusted Hector and paid for it. But in this moment you swear to yourself You wont make Anton experience the same. His trust in you wont be broken no matter what happens. You cant tell him the truth not yet but your silent lies wont destroy his life. You wont be like Hector. No matter what happens. Hes not in the city anymore.You blink multiple times fighting against your tiredness. It is dark and cold and quiet and it takes you a few seconds to remember where you are and how you got here.You and Anton didnt manage to leave Pallas Athos before sunset too occupied with hiding from everyone who could potentially be a danger the Witnesses the Paladin almost every citizen. Eventually you decided to settle down in an abandoned building full of dancing dust croaky wind and forgotten memories. You took turns keeping watch trusting the other not to betray you to the Witnesses or the Paladin. It was a trust that was surprisingly easy to give considering you dont know each other but a trust you gave each other anyway.What happened you ask because you already forgot what Anton said.He looks you right in the eye. Your friend left the city a few minutes ago. I cant feel his esha anymore.You freeze. Hector. You knew how risky it was to stay here how likely it was that Hector would find a way to leave but you did it anyway and regret it now more than anything. You bite your lip try not to show how disappointed you are. Its not Antons fault. Quite the contrary in fact. Without him you wouldnt even know if Hector is still alive.So you swallow the regret that sparks inside your heart and say We will follow him after sunrise. Thanks for telling me.He took the East Gate Anton informs you. The Gate that leads to the harbors heavily guarded and almost impossible to pass without an official permission. You wonder briefly how Hector got through but then you decide it doesnt matter. You will find a way to follow him even if you have to break more rules along the way.After all you already broke the most important rule of all. Protect the Prophet.And since you dont believe its Hector and dont believe its Anton you broke your oath and forfeited your life. Even if one of them turns out to be the Prophet its already too late. You made your choice and wont go back.Do you have a guess on where he might go Anton continues.You raise your head. HuhYou want to find your friend right And since my Grace hasnt endless reach it would be really helpful to already know where to look.You bite your lip and avoid his gaze. You dont want to admit that you have no clue that you dont know Hector as much as you thought you did. He clearly wanted to take revenge on the Pale Hand and her sister but neither of these two are in the city anymore and you dont know where they went how to find them if they followed Hector or Hector followed them.You have so many questions and so few ways to get answers it becomes frustrating. But Anton wants an answer so you say He probably searches for the Last Prophet.It takes you a full second to realize what you have said what you have revealed. Anton stares at you with wide eyes like he cant believe what he just heard. The Prophet is just a myth he says and he sounds so sure that you wouldve believed him if you didnt know the truth.They arent you simply reply but dont elaborate why. They exist they are real. And Im sure that Hector wants to find them.You wonder why you lie why you cant bring yourself to admit the truth that Hector searches for his past and not the future he abandoned. Hectors life isnt Antons business but this is not the reason why you hide it. No you hide it because you are ashamed ashamed of being such a bad friend a friend who never even considered how Hector must feel. It was right of him to abandon you in hindsight youre surprised that he didnt do it sooner.Why Anton interrupts your thoughts and for a second you think he answers to your thoughts until you remember what you told him.You hesitate. You already told Anton too much by revealing the existence of the Last Prophet. You cant possibly reveal the Orders existence as well. You already betrayed them so it shouldnt matter but But You still hold your duty close to your heart and dont want to abandon it just yet. So you say Its not my story to tell.Anton nods and looks at you. His gaze burns your skin in a way you never experienced before. It is comfortable. Distractedly comfortable.After a few seconds Anton asks What is your story then My story You swallow dont want to think about it. Your story is a scripted one one you didnt choose for yourself but one you followed because the Order wanted to. And this is something you dont want to admit that all of this is not your choice but something you did because you were too cowardly to stand up to yourself to your wishes and to your desires to everything you are.A few seconds pass but they dont feel like a few seconds but like a fuse burning out slowly and painfully and so so close to exploding.Finally Anton shrugs and says Its all right. You dont have to share it if you dont want to.You breathe a sigh of relief. Because you dont want to. Not now not when you are so close to breaking apart. So close to showing him what you feel and what you want and what you are not allowed to be.Thank you you say. I rather keep it to myself for the moment. You stumble over your last words. For the moment. Because it feels like a promise a vow an oath. That you will tell him about yourself eventually just not right now. You cant possibly know if youll actually do it but a part of you definitely wants to.You look at Anton and wonder why. Could he actually be the Prophet the person you are bonded to Because this is the only reasonable explanation that comes to mind.Well you decide I will find out eventually.But for now you need to find Hector. You shouldve known that it wouldnt be that easy. Anton may be a seer someone able to find Hector but he is also a criminal chased by the law. This is something you forgot. Something you shouldnt have forgotten.Because the second you wake up you feel it Multiple people surrounded the abandoned house Anton and you stayed in. You immediately get up draw your sword and prepare for a fight but you already know that even with your Grace of Heart you cant possibly defeat them all.Your full power is supposed to awaken the second you recognize the Prophet but so far you havent. And even if youre lucky and Anton is the one you are searching for its to no avail until you actually feel it. And that is something you cannot influence.Even worse Anton is still asleep on the couch he has no idea about the danger you are in. He cant help you he cant do anything. And you You wont be able to do this alone.You close your eyes and pray to the Prophet beg for a miracle something that will help you to win the upcoming fight. It doesnt work. They take your sword and imprison you both. You try to defend yourself try to fight try to flee while Anton does nothing. Not when the Witnesses take you to their ship. Not when they throw you both in its cells. And not when you get off a few days later in Nazirah only to get imprisoned again in its lighthouse.Its like he accepted his upcoming death.The thought makes you furious. Giving up is something you will never consider but for Anton it is the first thing that comes to mind. You dont understand. Why is his life so worthless to him What happened in his past that made him long for a quick death The question tingles your lips but you dont speak it out loud.You dont know how many heartbeats you have left how many breaths will leave your mouth but you will make sure that every single one is worth it. You will find a way to save you both you will show Anton just how precious his life can be will make him regret that he wanted to throw it away.What worries you however are the chains that keep Anton restrained. They are different than yours you dont exactly know how and why but they radiate a malicious aura something you cant quite put into words because you never felt something like it before.You want to help him. But you cant even help yourself so how can you possibly hope to save someone elseYou glance at him separated by a few metallic bars and the secrets you cant reveal. Secrets you want to reveal. Its the last chance for both of you the last chance to share what youre truly thinking. Because as much as you want to free you both you know its not likely not anymore when you are so close to the Hierophant. You have to accept the truth.One of you wont make it out of here alive. And you dont want it to be Anton.I wish it was you you blurt out forbidden words you never intended to say to someone other than Hector. Anton raises his head looks at you and asks WhyYou suck in a deep breath. Because I vowed to protect the Last Prophet the one who can stop the Age of Darkness with everything I have. Once I know who it is the true power of my Grace will awaken the only thing able to free us.You dont tell him that you wanted Hector to be the Prophet. By now you realized the harsh truth It was never meant to be. It isnt Hector. And while it probably isnt Anton either he is your last chance to escape. Your last chance to find your true purpose.Anton doesnt reply to your words but his gaze already contains everything you need to know. Its not Anton either. You sigh and look away at the huge door that keeps you inside your cell. You already tried to break it open multiple times in fact but it never worked. You are too weak too dependent on the Last Prophets power. On the power of someone you will never find.Hours pass and you have trouble keeping your eyes open tired from the long journey and your imprisonment. But while Anton eventually sinks into a dreams embrace you refuse to fall asleep. The Witnesses are still here probably waiting for you to show weakness waiting for the right moment to burst in and take you to the Hierophant. Of course its not like you can defend yourself against them but you still rather stay awake than falling right into their trap.To distract yourself you begin to ask yourself questions questions about the Hierophant and the Last Prophet. Most of all you wonder why you are still alive and why they havent kill Anton either. Does the Hierophant need you Does he need Anton Does he know who the Last Prophet is Is he the Last Prophet himselfYou startle at the thought. The Hierophant the Last Prophet. No this is something you dont believe. Something you dont want to believe. The Hierophant hates the Graced. It wouldnt make any sense for him to be the person you are waiting for. But maybe he does know who it is maybe your hope about it being Anton isnt wishfulfillment after all.Except why would they keep Anton right next to you instead of taking him somewhere more enclosed You wouldnt take such a risk. No you would either kill or imprison him would make sure that he cant stop the Age of Darkness. And yet the Hierophant hasnt done so.Or maybe he is just like you maybe he needs a seer to find the Prophet and not just any seer but one who is powerful enough to find absolutely everyone. While you dont know just how powerful Anton really is hes certainly not weak.So only one question remainsWhy does the Hierophant need you You wake up when the door creaks open. Immediately you stand up but the Witness that stands in front of you remains unimpressed. He wears a golden mask and for a moment you fear he is the Hierophant pretending to be one of his servants. But then the Witness begins to talk.The Immaculate One wants to speak to you he says and it sounds like he grinds his teeth. I will take you to him. He doesnt sound happy about it.You want to refuse but of course its not your choice to make. You glance at Anton who is still asleep. What about him you ask.The masked Witness dismisses your words with a wave of his hand. He is not important. The words hurt. Because not that long ago you thought the same. Youve been obsessed with finding Hector ignoring everyone else in the process. Anton was a means to an end nothing more. He was not important.You swallow. Then why dont you let him go You dont expect an answer to your question but to your surprise the Witness answers it.What do you think Hes a hostage of course. A guarantee.Oh. Of course. You understand now. By yourself you never wouldve given up never wouldve followed the Witnesses advice. But with Anton as a prisoner you are willing to do almost everything.Almost.You give Anton one last look one last desperate look. You want him to wake up want to give him a proper goodbye. You fear that youll never see him again.He doesnt wake up.Swallowing hard you look away and follow the masked Witness. Jude Weatherbourne.A shiver runs down your spine. From the Hierophants mouth your name sounds like an insult. Like a curse.Like the name of someone who shouldnt be alive.You dont move dont show your fear dont dare to look away from the Hierophants blue eyes the only thing his mask reveals. You wonder what he wants why he hasnt killed you yet if he plans to kill you now. Maybe the masked Witness will do it maybe thats why he is here.Or maybe they want you to kill yourself.You press your lips together and dont say anything. They will use every word against you. You cant show them any weakness even though they already know what it is. Anton. Who wouldve guessed that a boy you just met would grow to become so much moreDo you know why you are here the Hierophant continues with a calm voice.You dont answer.Something like anger flashes through the Hierophants blue eyes but it disappears so quickly that you arent sure if you imagined it. He gestures to his Witness and you tense prepare for a fight you wont be able to win. You can use your Grace but the Hierophant can use the full force of his people. You arent a match for them. You will lose inevitably.But you still refuse to give up.To your surprise though the Witness does not attack you but removes his mask instead.And your whole world crumbles breaks apart and leaves nothing but ash and dust.You dont know who this is. Dont even know his name. But what you do know with a certainty you never felt before is the fact that this man the Hierophants servant is the Last Prophet you so desperately sought.You lose your breath you lose yourself. It cant be it just cant but it is and you have to live with it.Its not Hector. Its not Hassan. And it isnt Anton either.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/33831340,Like A Storm,The First Five Days First Day Take your clothes off Anton says.Jude freezes. What He must have misheard. There is no way Anton is saying what Jude thinks hes saying. Take your clothes off.Anton rolls his eyes. If I wanted to see you naked I would say so Jude. But right now I care more about not being recognized. Thats why we have to change our clothes.Judes cheeks flush pink. He clears his throat searches for the right words. I I dont have any spare clothes Anton.Then I guess you have to go naked Anton says joyously.Jude stares at him.Just joking Anton adds quickly. I wanted to tease you a bit nothing more. Dont worry I bought us a set of clothes.When Jude asks surprised.When I was at the outpost Anton reveals lowering his gaze. You know. When you thought I was gone.Anton Its fine Anton interrupts him with a tone that very much suggests that it is not fine. After all it is something I wouldve done normally.But you didnt Jude points out. You didnt. And I shouldnt have assumed that you did.Its fine Anton insists. Lets get dressed shall we Its clear that he doesnt want to talk about it but Jude wont let him get away that easy.I already said it he reminds Anton. We are dependent on each other and keeping secrets just makes things unnecessarily difficult Fine. Anton takes a deep breath. You hurt me but I cant blame you for that. I havent done anything to earn your trust.But he is wrong. He defended Jude in front of the whole Tribunal. He saved him from the Witnesses refused to leave him behind. Even when they first met Anton saved him from bleeding out.And how did Jude thank him By assuming the worst. By expecting to be left behind. By treating Anton like a stranger.Im sorry I didnt trust you Jude says earnestly. I promise I will from now on.Dont Anton responds simply. I will just end up disappointing you.He is lying. He was hurt when Jude didnt show his trust and Jude is determined to not let it happen again. He looks at Anton.Undress me he says.Anton stares at him. WhatUndress me Jude repeats calmly. If I do it Ill just hurt myself. You wont.Not yet Anton murmurs. He avoids Judes gaze. I know what youre doing. You want to show that you trust me. But it doesnt work like that. Trust isnt something you show by letting someone undress you.I still want you to do it.Anton takes a deep breath. Are you sureJude looks him in the eyes. Yes.Anton steps closer. Judes skin tingles. Like it awaits Antons touch. Like it longs for it. Nobody ever undressed him before at least not since Jude was a child. The Paladin werent allowed to get too close to each other.Especially not so close that they dont even need their Grace to smell each others skin.Jude is confused. He knows Antons scent knows how his closeness feels but right now it overwhelms him and drowns every other feeling. He can just look at Anton let him loosen his cloak let him unbutton his shirt button by button by button. Judes heartbeat rings in his ears a warm shiver runs through his body and he cant look away from Anton.The air feels cold on Judes skin but inside he is warm warmer than he ever was. His heart races his thoughts stop his breath mingles with Antons.TThanks he stutters. I can do the rest myself. He wont let Anton undress his trousers.A light blush wanders over Antons skin and a cheeky smile follows it. It was my pleasure.Jude blushes and stays quiet. First Night Anton dreams.Of Illya. Of the Hierophant. Of the Nameless Woman.Of Jude.He opens his eyes. Jude lies beside him breathing calmly sleeping so soundly as if they werent in danger at all but just two boys camping in the wild. A smile flits over Antons lips.Today they decided to go to Endarrion to find Judes sword the only possible way to get his Grace back. But seeing Jude like this looking so young and innocent awakens another wish in Anton. A forbidden wish a wish that first took root when Jude promised to protect him.He wants to know him better.Its such an unfamiliar thought an unfamiliar desire something Anton never thought he would have. Not after he escaped from home. But now he does. Because Jude saved him. Because Anton grew attached to him.Because they are meant to be together.Judes eyes flutter. Anton holds his breath. He doesnt want Jude to wake up. He deserves a good nights sleep. It will probably be the only one hell have.To Antons relief Jude stays asleep. He looks at him wondering what kind of dreams Jude has. Does he dream of Hector Of his lost GraceOf AntonAnton doesnt know how this thought makes him feel. Beforehand he didnt care whether or not several men dreamed of him. But with Jude he does. He wants to be a part of his life wants to be someone Jude dreams about someone he wants to dream about.Is it because of their connection Because of Judes esha Its weak now barely a breeze but Anton still remembers the first time he felt it how it almost knocked him over like a storm like an entire world.Anton wants to feel it again.His gaze finds Judes lips and he doesnt look away. Very very daring thoughts overcome him. Anton shakes them away. They are dangerous they are reckless and most importantly They are forbidden. Not for him but for Jude. Anton cant imagine him abandoning his chastity his poverty his obedience all the things he swore when he made his oath.Anton swallows and finally looks away focuses on Judes throat instead. A few white scars peek out of his clothing an endless reminder of Antons failures. Of his cowardice.Of everything he wanted to leave behind.He remembers how he touched them after Jude got wounded by a crossbow. And how desperately he had wanted to touch them again after undressing Jude. He still doesnt know what overcame him back then. But he wants to feel them wants to feel just how much he hurt Jude. Just how much he owes him.Because he owes him everything.If it werent for him he would be dead. He would have drowned. Anton owes Jude his life and he is determined to compensate for it in any way he can.Anton Anton freezes and he holds his breath. He didnt notice that Jude was awake. But quickly he realizes He isnt awake.He is dreaming.He is dreaming and whispering Antons name.A pleasant shudder runs through Antons body. Many men whispered his name before but no one can even remotely compare to Jude. Antons heart feels like a little flame growing bigger and bigger like the sun becoming brighter and brighter. He smiles at Jude even though the sleeping swordsman cant see it.Sweet dreams he whispers.Then he closes his eyes. Second Day So who is this Evander exactly Jude asks. The whole morning Anton wore a smile on his lips and Jude cant help but think about Antons friend they are going to visit in Endarrion. He mentioned him exactly once so far which Jude finds extremely concerning. Surely Anton would mention him more often if Evander was truly his friendHes the son of Anton starts but Jude interrupts him quickly.No I mean What is he to you I have the feeling you havent told me the whole truth back then. He doesnt want to accuse Anton of lying especially with no concrete proof but at the same time he isnt sure what to make of Antons silence.We were friends Anton insists but suddenly a red shimmer colors his cheeks. Friends with benefits to be more precise.Friends with Jude closes his mouth. Friends with benefits. Now he wishes he hadnt asked. He knew he wouldnt like the answer but of course he was stupid enough to ask him anyway.Yeah Anton murmurs. He avoids Judes gaze. Nothing special to be honest. He was one of many.One of many Jude repeats. A strange feeling twists his stomach a feeling he cant quite identify. It is unpleasant like someone is poisoning his blood his heart his thoughts. It is so absurd He doesnt even know Evander let alone the other men Anton slept with but Jude wants nothing more than to punch them in the face.Because its clear that they didnt respect him. Anton the Last Prophet. He was just a boy to them a body they could explore but not someone who deserved their love.Jude clenches his fists. This is this is so horrible Anton.Anton shrugs. Its my life. What did you expectJude doesnt know how to answer that. Because he didnt expect it but now feels he should have. Antons life is so different from his own. Jude wanted someones closeness without ever receiving it Anton received someones closeness without wanting it.And that is so much worse.That Evander guy Jude asks hesitantly did he did he use you too Yet another question Jude doesnt want to know the answer for but a question that needs to be answered for this very reason.To his relief Anton shakes his head. He was pretty nice. A little clingy but nice. Now that I think about it he was probably the best.Jude winces. That doesnt reassure him at all. He should be glad that Evander was different than the other men Anton had met but instead he feels like throwing up. He was probably the best. Why does he feel the sudden urge to break something It doesnt make any sense. Evander will be fine. Or well finer.But it doesnt feel like that at all.Of course Anton continues with a smile nobody can even remotely compare to you.Jude blushes. I Im not Anton interrupts him. I already said it during the Tribunal. You saved me. Youre the only one who ever has. As much as enjoyable my time with Evander was its nothing compared to the time I spent with you.Jude blinks in irritation. Oh. He doesnt know what else to say. But at last he knows how he feels.He is happy. Happy. He lost his Grace his sword and his place in the Order but he is still happy.Because he has Anton by his side. Second Night Judes smile follows him into his dreams almost makes him forget that he doesnt deserve it. Its such a rare sight Jude smiling seeing him happy after so many bad things happened to him.And Anton made him happy. He still cant quite believe it. Hes an expert in making people mad but happy Thats something he never thought he would achieve. At least not in a way that makes him happy as well.But he did. And hes so so grateful for it. Yes he doesnt deserve someone as amazing as Jude but hes still happy to have him. Hes so different than any other man Anton knows different in a good way.Maybe because hes the only one who doesnt want anything from him. Which of course makes Anton want him even more.He quickly dismisses the thought. He wont ask Jude for something hes not willing to give. Plus he isnt ready for a relationship anyway. Its been a while since he laid so close to someone close enough to smell their skin close enough to hear their racing heartbeat. Evander was in fact the last one. And theyve done way more than lying side by side each night.Its strange thinking about it now. Jude sleeps as soundly as he did yesterday an unlikely miracle but maybe not unlikely at all. Anton wonders if Jude likes sleeping so close to him. Evander definitely did. But Jude is almost the complete opposite of him almost like an entirely different world.A world Anton wants to live in.A world he will never get to live in.Evander sought his closeness but Jude just lets it happen. He doesnt seek for anything. He lets Anton sleep beside him because they dont have another choice not because he wants him to be close. This is something Anton keeps forgetting.Hes the only one who wants this.Automatically he slides back a little but before he can do more Jude wraps an arm around him and pulls him back.Antons heart pounds in his ears. Jude is still asleep. He acted on instinct probably didnt want to lose his warmth. Anton looks at him.This is something Evander and Jude actually have in common. Whenever Anton moved away Evander pulled him close. And yet it feels so different. Anton wasnt entirely comfortable with Evander begging for his closeness but with Jude it feels like the most normal thing in the world. It feels right. Anton doesnt know how Jude feels about him but he finally knows how he feels about Jude.He wants him.But not much else. Anton wants Jude because his body wants him because his Grace wants him but not because Anton himself grew attached to him. Not yet at least. Anton certainly likes Jude but he has been disappointed too many times for allowing his feelings to blossom.For now he tramples them. If he truly likes Jude they will grow back. But for now he reminds himself on who they are on who they should be. The Last Prophet and his Keeper on a journey to restore the latters Grace. Nothing more. Nothing more. It already feels like a lie. Third Day Anton seems distracted.Jude noticed it since theyve woken up but he blamed the early morning a time Anton definitely isnt used to wake up in. But now its midday and he still looks like he lost himself in his thoughts.Anton Jude asks hesitantly and Anton flinches.YesHow are youIm fine Anton says but Jude just raises his eyebrows. His lie couldnt have been more obvious. Suddenly a thought strikes him. A thought he somehow dismissed until now.Is it Is it my faultHuh What makes you think that Anton asks who clearly didnt expect this question.Yesterday I didnt even ask you if you wanted to sleep next to me Jude explains. But I really should have especially after our conversation. Now he feels ashamed for not having done so. He was selfish. Selfish and stupid.Anton waves him off. Dont worry about it. I know you would never do something I dont want you to do.Jude eyes widen in pleasant surprise. He doesnt feel like he deserves Antons forgiveness but he is thankful for it anyway. Can I ask you something Anton he says quietly.Of course.Why were you so distracted earlier What were you thinking about These questions still need an answer.Nothing Anton lies so obviously that Jude is on the verge on calling him out. He doesnt do that though. Antons secrets are his to keep. They are none of his business. We will protect Anton anyway.At least as much as he can without his Grace.All right he says accepting Antons silence. You dont have to tell me if you dont want to. I just want to make sure that its not me whos causing you trouble. The words sounded good in his head but spoken out loud they make it seem like Jude is fine with other people troubling Anton. Quickly he opens his mouth to correct himself but Anton is faster.I know what you mean. But its complicated you know Im not used to any of this. He gestures towards the trees and the river. I didnt have many people in my life who were willing to help me without wanting something in return. Youre the first one in fact.That thought horrifies Jude. He always relied on someones help. The Paladins. His fathers. Hectors. Without them Jude wouldnt be the person he is now. Which now that he thinks about it probably isnt a good thing but he is still glad that he had someone to rely on.Having nobody Jude cant imagine it. Maybe the Paladin are something special since they renounce every worldly desire but Jude has a hard time believing that they are the only ones willing to help a stranger who cant help themselves.Im glad I found you he says earnestly. I cant imagine how hard it was to grow up like this. Alone. Helpless.Anton shrugs. I didnt know anything else. Its all right Jude. I have you now. He smiles at him.Jude doesnt think it is all right but he doubts saying that will change Antons mind. So instead he promises I will stay with you as long as you want.That would be forever Jude Anton laughs.Jude blushes. Then I will he confirms. I will stay with you until the end.Until the end Anton repeats as if he cant believe it. I Thank you Jude.Jude doesnt know how to respond so he just smiles and hopes it is enough.It is. Third Night I will stay with you until the end. He was happy when Jude gave him this promise but now Anton questions himself everything he said everything he asked for. It is so much. It is too much.He shouldnt have asked for any of it.But at the same time hes too cowardly to take it back. He needs Jude. He doesnt want to let him go. He will do it if Jude wants to but he wont chase him away by himself. Which considering Antons past experiences is quite unusual. Because he left everybody else. Illya. Evander. And so many men in between men Anton didnt care about.He cares about Jude.Still awake he asks while they lie beside each other once again.Jude opens his eyes. Is something wrongAnton shakes his head a weird movement while laying on the side. I just wanted to ask you something. Jude waits for him patiently. Anton doesnt look him in the eyes when the words leave his mouth. For you my past is one horrible experience isnt itYes Jude says without hesitation. Because no one was there for you.Anton nods. I just wondered what about your past Because as far as I can tell it was very dictated. I couldnt do many things because I couldnt afford them but you couldnt because you werent allowed to.A shadow settles on Judes features unrelated to the setting sun. You could say that he mutters. But I was still safe. I had friends. And I never had to ask myself how I was going to survive the next day. Unlike you. He looks so distressed like he still blames himself for finding Anton so late. It hurts Anton to see him like this.If it makes you feel better I wouldnt have liked living like that he says. To me your life sounds just as horrible as mine. I had to sell every single part of me just to make it through some hard times but in a way you had to do that as well.Jude looks like he wants to contradict him but he doesnt. This alone speaks volumes. There is a part of Jude that wants to agree with him but he isnt ready to do it just yet. So Anton isnt surprised when he changes the topic.I dont think it benefits any of us if we compare our lives like that. This isnt a competition about who has the worst one.Of course not. Because if it was I would win. He winks at Jude and enjoys seeing him blush.You are ridiculous.Never claimed otherwise. It feels good to see Jude smile and to smile himself. He hasnt quite overcome his past yet but hes on his way. Making jokes about it somehow helps. It is a joke that isnt funny but maybe thats the reason why making fun of it makes him feel better.Jude looks at him. Im glad you can laugh about it now. I never could.Anton returns his gaze. Im glad you cant laugh about it.They stay silent for a while and suddenly Anton realizes just how close they lay beside each other. The only people Anton came that close to were his brother and the men he slept with.With Jude just having him here is enough.And that shows him more than anything that Jude is the person Anton had been waiting for.The person Anton wants not to share his body but his soul with. Fourth Day A storm is coming Anton says shortly after they wake up.Jude who is busy with collecting their stuff to continue their journey looks up. Do you mean that figuratively or literallyBoth. Anton gestures at the sky. We should probably stay here Jude.We cant afford that Jude objects. Were already behind schedule.Id rather be late than dead Anton replies dryly.Jude cant argue with that. He will protect Anton no matter what and he doesnt want to be the cause of the thing he is protecting Anton from.All right he says. Were staying here for today.Anton looks at him surprised.What is it Jude asks. Did you think I would refuseUh Anton says. Jude looks at him horrified. You did didnt youAnton shrugs helplessly. Im not used to getting what I want.Jude bites his lip. Every time he thinks he knows just how horrible Antons life was Anton reveals something new about it. They talked about their pasts yesterday but Jude fundamentally disagrees that they had equally bad lives.Antons life was so much worse than his.Well stay Jude reassures him. And Ill protect you from the storm.A smile hushes over Antons face. I know.Jude builds up their tent again but he doesnt believe it will stand a chance against the upcoming storm. He needs something better. Something stronger.Something he can protect Anton with.In this moment Jude spots it A cave partly hidden by the trees. He sighs in relief. There he says. We can spend the day in the cave.Sounds wonderful Anton beams. He helps Jude to get their stuff over while the clouds slowly get darker and darker. There really is a storm coming. Jude doesnt like it. It makes them slower postpones the moment he will get his Grace back.Once they are settled in the cave Anton makes a fire and Jude takes off his cloak.What are you doing Anton asks.Jude answers by putting his cloak around Anton. Anton looks at him stunned. Youre going to freeze Anton objects.Youre making fire Jude shrugs. I think Ill be fine. Plus I promised to protect you remember Thats my way of doing it.Anton shakes his head. I dont want you to protect me at your expense. Thats just selfish.Its fine Jude says softly. I help you by giving you my cloak and you help me by making fire. All rightAnton looks at him. All right he finally says.In this moment a blight thunderbolt strikes right in front of the cave followed by a loud thunder. In an instant Anton throws himself in Judes arms.Jude holds his breath. He doesnt move. He cant move. He hears Antons heartbeat or maybe he just imagines hearing it but before he can actually focus on it Anton backs away.SSorry. It was a reflex. I didnt know what I was thinking.It takes Jude a moment before he realizes what Anton is referring to. He was so distracted by Antons closeness that he didnt even think about its meaning. Anton hugged him. He hugged him without thinking.This shows just how much he trusts him. Jude suspected it before but now he knows it he feels it and it touches his heart more than anything else.Anton trusts him.And Jude makes a promise to himself He will trust Anton as well. Fourth Night The storm reminds him of Jude.His Grace is gone but hes just as overwhelming without it. Anton cant take his eyes off him and he doesnt want to.Until Jude says Its so cold isnt it He stutters and shivers and he doesnt seem to notice Antons intense gaze. Its in this moment Anton realizes Jude isnt used to any of this. Anton slept outside so many times that sleeping in a bed actually feels stranger. But Jude Jude is used to a comfortable life. He doesnt know how hard it is to survive out there how hard it is to keep every piece of yourself when every day and every night threatens to break you apart.Here. Anton moves over to Jude takes off his cloak and gives it back to him. Thatll keep you warm.But you will I will be fine Anton reassures him. Ill just stay very close to you. If you want it.Jude looks up at him. I want it.And so Anton stays by his side warms him with his closeness fuels the fire and gives him support. When Judes eyelids start to flutter Anton offers Come here. Sleep. Ill watch over you.But Jude says weakly Im supposed to watch over you.You cant do that when youre dead Anton says sternly. Sleep Jude. I beg you.Finally Jude nods. Anton holds him tightly and softly and like hes the most precious thing in the world because he is. Somehow this feels more personal more intimate than anything Anton ever did with another man. And even stranger It is enough. Anton always gave away so much always thought that it was the only way to make others happy the only way to be happy himself.But it isnt. It never was.Jude is the only one he needs.While he sleeps the storm continues to haunt the night and it starts to resemble Jude less. It becomes violent it becomes scary it becomes demanding.Just like his brother.Anton flinches at the thought. He looks at Jude who is sleeping in his arms. He looks so innocent. Peaceful. Like he finally found someone he can trust.Anton cant believe that he is that person.While the thunderstorm dances around their little cave Anton feels a warmth blooming in his chest something he cant remember ever feeling before. He looks at Jude.Im really glad youre here he whispers. Its easier to say it while Jude is asleep. Youre the only one who ever helped me. The only one who saved me. I dont know how I can ever make it up to you. But He puts one of Judes strands of hair aside. I promise you Ill try.Getting Judes sword back is just the first step. Anton owes him his Grace but it wont be enough to make up for everything Jude did for him. For everything Anton did to him.No he can only make it up by making him the Keeper of the Word again. Which means Anton has to stop the Age of Darkness. Otherwise the Order will never see just how amazing Jude is. But it is a tricky task. A task Anton isnt sure he can fulfill.A task he cant fulfillHe doesnt want to think about it. Sighing Anton looks outside. Its still raining the storm hasnt stopped but Anton feels it wont take long. It will probably die down by sunrise. Then they will continue their journey to Evander to Judes sword to the day Anton will prove his worth.He really hopes he will be able to. Fifth Day Jude wakes up in Antons arms.It feels right.Immediately he jerks away stares at Anton disbelievingly. He just starts to wake up himself. It takes Jude a few seconds to remember where he is and how he got here. The storm. The cave. The fire.Anton. Anton. Jude speaks his name but he himself barely hears it. It is Anton who speaks the first audible words.Whats wrongNothing Jude says too quickly still staring at Anton. At his skeptic look he admits I shouldnt have used you like that.Anton folds his arms. Like whatJude blushes. You know what I mean he avoids the question. Lets Lets just go all right He doesnt want to talk it. He is ashamed. He is ashamed because he enjoyed laying in his arms. It felt so natural. Normal. Like it was supposed to happen.It isnt supposed to happen.All right Anton says calmly. Lets go. We have a lot to catch up on dont weJude wonders if Anton means something more than their journey. He clears his throat. Yes. We have. Lets go.He gathers their belongings and leaves the cave without looking back. He hears Antons footsteps as he follows him. Jude intends to be the lead this time but he doesnt make it far.Anton catches him before he falls on the ground. Easy there. Dont overdo it. He helps Jude to get on his feet.Im not overdoing anything Jude complains. Im perfectly fine.Anton raises his eyebrows but Jude ignores him. He is fine. Weak but fine.Until he remembers something. It was as though without his Grace his body slowly lost its will to function. It shut down. And he died.Back in Kerameikos he asked a healer about his Grace but she wasnt able to help him. She just told him about other people who lost theirs about how they slowly died painfully and soulless.Is it happening now Does his body finally start to shut down too Panic rushes through Judes veins he cant think straight. No no it cant be not now Im not ready yet I need just a little bit more time Jude Anton asks worryingly. What is it You look pale.Undress me Jude says.Anton looks at him. WhatPlease just do it. He doesnt want to share his fears not until he knows if they are valid or not. Maybe not even after that. It is selfish if Jude is actually going to die Anton absolutely deserves to know but he doesnt want to burden Anton more than he already has.Anton undresses him carefully like Judes body is fragile porcelain he doesnt want to break. What is it he asks again after Judes upper body lays open.Jude avoids Antons gaze. Can you touch my scarsAnton blinks. What is going on Jude Youre acting strange. What happenedJude sucks in a deep breath. Im not sure yet. I promise Ill tell you if I am. But before I need to know if I can still feel something. He doesnt finish his sentence though but hopes Anton will understand him anyway.He does.His fingers brush Judes scars and he shivers. He definitely feels Antons touch. So far at least his body is all right.Anton lowers his hand. So why did you want me to do thatJude swallows hard. But he promised Anton to tell him the truth so he does.I think my body weakens because I lost my Grace.Anton looks at him horrified. No. No way.Jude doesnt want to believe it either. But he cant deny the truth.Sooner than later he wont be able to feel Antons touch anymore. He wont be able to feel anything anymore.He will fail.He will break his promise.And ultimately he will die. Fifth Night No. Jude cant die. He cant. Anton feels his Grace he knows it isnt gone knows its absence doesnt destroy Judes body.Nevertheless he starts to doubt himself. What if he is wrong What if Jude is really dying dying because of Anton What if hes about to lose him right here and nowNo. He cant lose him. He wont lose him. No matter what happens.But what can he do How can he save Jude Nothing comes to mind. Maybe because there isnt a solution. Maybe because Jude is destined to die.Maybe because Anton is destined to kill him. No. Anton wont let that happen. He doesnt know what he can do to stop it but he will find a way. After all he is the Last Prophet isnt he There has to be something he can do. Something He closes his eyes and falls into his dream.The Nameless Woman stands before him. Its white all around them like they left the boundaries of the world and entered a new one. And they did in a way. Anton doesnt know how the Nameless Woman is doing this but in this moment he doesnt care. They have more important matters to discuss.How can I save himThe Nameless Woman tilts her head. What makes you think you need toAnton blinks. What makes you think I dontOh Anton. The Nameless Woman smiles. You dont need to. Your friend will be fine. You just need to trust in yourselves.Anton snorts. Like it would ever be that easy.But it is the Nameless Woman says seriously. You make it so difficult for yourself Anton. Its almost like you want to suffer.He doesnt deny it.I just dont want to lose him.You wont the Nameless Woman says softly. As long as you believe in him and in yourself. She says it like its obvious and maybe it is but Anton still finds it hard to believe her. After a lifetime of suffering accepting an easy solution isnt an easy thing to do.But how can that help me And him His Grace is gone. His body will decay without it. My hopes and beliefs can hardly prevent that.Ah. The Nameless Woman nods. I see. And then she tells him that hes wrong. That Judes body isnt decaying but simply sick after the stormy night. They both overreacted. They both saw their worst fears without considering how logical they are.Jude will be fine. He will be fine. Anton takes a deep breath. So many feelings flood his heart. Relief. Happiness. Gratitude.Love.He looks at the Nameless Woman. Thank you.She nods and lets him go. As soon as he wakes up its in the middle of the night he shakes Jude awake. He jolts up immediately. What is it he asks panic coloring his voice.Anton puts a finger on his lips. Quiet. I had a dream he says and Judes worried expression doesnt change in the slightest. You will be fine Jude. Your Grace is not gone.Jude stares at him with wide eyes. Are you Are you sure You dont just say that to comfort me do youI am sure Anton answers. Youre going to get it back. I cant tell you more though. I dont want to risk you losing it.Jude looks like hes on the verge of tears. Thank you Anton he whispers. Thank you.Before Anton can respond Jude wraps his arms around him. Anton closes his eyes and returns his embrace. And his lips form the words he will never be allowed to say I love you Jude.,Teen And Up Audiences,Book 2: As the Shadow RisesSnapshotsMissing SceneAngstDoubtTrustTalkingJealousyFalling In LoveFeelings RealizationUndressingLiteral Sleeping TogetherImplied/Referenced Underage ProstitutionHugsHuddling For WarmthTouchingLGBTQ CharacterConfessionsFearStaringCuddling & SnugglingFirst Kiss
https://archiveofourown.org/works/33105919,Under Your Skin,Chapter 1 The Lights Touch Jude is five when the full weight of his destiny settles on his shoulders.Its the day his father tells him Now your training will begin. But its also the day his father tells him From now on dont allow anyone to touch your skin.Why Jude asks. He doesnt understand. And so his father explains. Its the day Jude learns what a touch really means the day he learns to despise it. A touch something that seemed to normal just a few hours ago is like sharing your heart your soul everything you are. Its something reserved only for Paladin that know each other more than they know themselves. Because Jude has the Grace of Heart a skill hell develop properly in his training receiving a touch will feel much more intimate than it ever did before.Itll be more than a kiss his father explains. And itll grow more and more intimate the older and the more experienced you get. Thats why were Paladin why he renounce every worldly desire. Because even as something as small as a touch will feel like we laid our whole body open.Jude shivers. That sounds scary.It is his father confirms. And thats why youll also get proper clothing protecting you from unwanted contact. Itll be your second skin the one that is safe to share. It will be a natural part of your life. But before I give it to you you must first receive the Lights Touch.The Lights TouchAs it turns out the Lights Touch is a special ceremony for children born with the Grace of Heart the last touch theyll receive before putting on their protective cloak. It is meant to give them strength which Jude doesnt understand but he doesnt question it. He isnt supposed to question anything.And so he doesnt defend himself when his father puts the Paladin cloak around his neck touching his skin one last time.Its staggering.Jude loses his breath his brain his body. Its just a little touch his fathers fingers brushing his throat. But it doesnt feel like a little touch. Its a fire blowing out a sudden rainfall something that sends a shiver down his spine. He feels the touch even after his father backs away an echo of an echo of an echo until the cloaks magic protection takes effect and brings him back to reality.What was this Jude breathes barely able to articulate his shock. His father doesnt answer maybe he didnt hear him. Jude never expected a touch to feel so personal. Jude feels vulnerable like another touch could shatter him to pieces. He is just a little boy he doesnt know anything about the world but he already feels the weight of it.And he doesnt like it at all. Years pass and Jude is careful not to touch anyone ever again. He gets gloves and more clothing that covers every part of his body but his face is still exposed and makes him fearful.He never forgets the Lights Touch the weight of his destiny his future as the Keeper of the Word. He trains his Grace and it grows more powerful every day soon overshadows the Graces of the other Paladin. But it comes with a price and Jude knows this. The more powerful he becomes the more intimate a single touch will feel. And so not only his power grows but his fear of paying for it sooner or later.Then when Jude is twelve years old almost thirteen everything hed been taught almost falls apart.Because the Order welcomes its newest member a boy with dark eyes and a dark expression a boy whose sight makes Judes heart stumble.His name is Hector Navarro and hed been touched not only by people but also by fate. Jude doesnt learn much about him except Hector lost his family just like every other member of the Order. But that doesnt matter. Jude feels somehow connected to this boy like he was supposed to meet him all along.During dinner he shares his bread with him and Hector takes it hesitantly. He doesnt smile but his thankful nod is enough for Jude.Hello he greets tries to break the ice. Im Jude. And youre Hector arent youHector nods.Do you need a little distraction Jude offers. I know a place thats perfect if you just want to relax.Hector nods again. After dinner Jude takes him to his favorite waterfall a place so peaceful and so far from any worries as you can imagine. Hector just stares takes in the sight. Jude doesnt disturb him. He remembers how he felt the first time he discovered this place. Back then he needed a little time to fully comprehend the natures beauty.After a few minutes Hector turns his head toward him. His lips lift slightly as if he wants to smile but doesnt quite manage to. Thank you Hector says. For bringing me here.Thank you for coming with me Jude responds. Youre the first I shown this place to. Its very special to me.Hector lets his gaze wander over the hills and rivers. Its beautiful.Jude almost responds Just like you. In the end he stays quiet but the words ring in his ears. He doesnt know what almost overcame him but he knows it is the truth.He likes this boy.He likes him a lot. They become friends partners in crime and yet neither of them touches the other. Their clothing prevents it but so does the Order. It doesnt like their friendship Penrose and Captain Weatherbourne make this very clear. But Jude doesnt care. He likes Hector and he likes being his friend. They talk and fight and go on nightly strolls careful not to share too much to get the Orders attention. They dont want to get separated.Whenever theyre alone however it becomes harder and harder to keep their boundaries. Or at least Jude feels this way. They share smiles and glances reassuring words and complicated koahs but its never enough. Jude doesnt know why. Hector being his friend is already too much than is allowed. So why doesnt it feel like too much Why does Jude cant stop thinking about him Why does he want to spend more and more time with Hector not caring about his fathers doubtsIt takes Jude a while to realize it. Four years to be exact. But when he is sixteen and Hector asks him for a midnight swim Jude is finally finally able to see the truth.He loves Hector.For over ten years nobody has touched him. The Lights Touch was the only touch he received since the start of his training. It shifted his world made him realize just how intimate a single touch can be. And now it makes him realize just how much he wants to receive one from Hector.Its an unfamiliar feeling. Almost scary. Jude never wanted more than fulfilling his duty but now other needs slowly overshadow the one he was never supposed to doubt.He still wants to fulfill his duty.But he also wants Hector.He cant have both. Sooner or later he has to choose. Jude knows what the Order expects him to do knows how he has to decide but he dreads the moment he actually has to make the choice.Because he isnt sure what he will do. What would you if you could do anything you wanted Hector asks and Jude almost almost betrays his oath and the Order and everything it stands for by telling him the truth. I would ask you to touch my skin. But of course he doesnt say that. Just thinking the words is a major violation of the Orders laws. He should stay quiet should hide his reddened cheeks but alas an almost honest answer escapes his mouth.Id go to the oasis of AlKhansa. Id drink pomegranate wine and ride elephants and send blue lily blossoms into the flooding river.In reality Jude doesnt want either of those things. Not really. He just wants one thing one person one single fate. But he cant have it have him so he dreams of another unlikely future instead.They look at each other and Hector takes a gulp from his stolen wine. Jude hesitates but then he returns the question to Hector.And Hector says Id go with you of course.Judes heart trips and stumbles and falls over and his desire to touch Hector rises like the sun getting more and more intense almost unbearable until he remembers that it cant ever happen.Hector smiles at him but Jude avoids his gaze and hopes Hector doesnt listen to his heart. Its so fast treacherously fast. Jude never wanted Hector so much as he does now Now on their last day together when both of them will go their separate ways. Jude will start his Year of Reflection and Hector Jude takes a deep breath. He really wants to ask. At the same time he isnt sure if he wants to know. Hector announced his departure yesterday shocking the whole Order and Jude most of all. He didnt say why he wants to leave just that he will return. That neither reassured Jude nor the Order. But nobody asked him for his reason nobody questioned his decision. Jude didnt because he respects Hectors boundaries and the Order didnt because they want Hector to leave.Of course nobody actually said that. But Jude knows the truth. Penrose his father every future member of his Guard nobody approved his friendship with Hector and Jude wouldnt be surprised if its the true reason behind their lack of suspicion.They want Hector gone. Now that he actually wants to leave he does exactly what the Order wants him to do.Jude opens his mouth and closes it again. He doesnt know what to say. Its their last day together and theres so much he wants Hector to know so much he wants to say but he doesnt find the right words. He knows he will never get the chance again if he doesnt do it now but that doesnt help him at all.He is so afraid. Afraid of saying something. Afraid of saying nothing. Afraid of making a mistake.In the end he does the only thing he can do and stays quiet. Its the right choice no matter how wrong it feels. Jude cant allow himself to break the Orders rules. No matter how much he loves Hector hes not the future that awaits him. Hes not the person hes supposed to spend the rest of his life with.The Last Prophet is.And Jude hopes sincerely hopes that his Year of Reflection will make him realize that. That it will squash his doubts his feelings. He doesnt need them. Not in the path the Order prepared for him. Its the only path there is.Even if its not the one Jude wants to follow. One year.For one full year Jude is alone far away from the Order and far away from Hector. For one full year he is supposed to meditate supposed to find the strength to fight his doubts. To find his purpose. To accept his fate.But he doesnt. He doesnt.After Judes Year of Reflection is finally finally over everything feels exactly like before. Nothing has changed. Jude still loves Hector still wants to touch him still doubts his duty and destiny.What happened Why didnt it work Jude meditated every single day practiced his koahs every morning and send a prayer to the Prophet every night but it didnt work. It didnt work.And for the first time in his life Jude wonders Is there something wrong with him Is he not supposed to become the Keeper of the Word Jude swallows while he waits for the ship that will bring him back to Kerameikos Fort.Maybe he isnt the right person for this. Maybe his father should choose someone else regardless of the Orders traditions. Maybe Jude should just leave and find Hector instead.But of course he doesnt. He stays where he is doesnt want to disappoint the people that believe in him. He doesnt want to be like Hector.The thought hurts. Jude doesnt believe he returned. As much as he wants to he isnt that naive. Hector was never like the other Paladin was never determined to fulfill their expectations. Jude always wanted to fit in while Hector always wanted to stand out.Jude isnt sure who made the wrong choice. And yet when thinking about the members of his Guard Hectors name never gets replaced by another.He greets Penrose and the other Paladin boards the ship and acts as if his Year of Reflection was as mindblowing as it was supposed to be. Nobody questions him. Nobody catches his lies. Maybe because Jude wants to believe them himself. He wants to be what the Order expects of him and that isnt the person he currently is.But it isnt until Jude actually returns that he realizes something else He will never be the Keeper theyve been waiting for.Because Hector is back.He is back. Judes heart skips a beat and relief rushes through his veins. The sixth member of his Guard the member he was afraid of never seeing again actually returned. Jude always hoped he would but he didnt really believe it. Now he regrets doubting his best friend.Im glad youre back he says with a smile.Thats where I belong Hector says with a shrug and Judes heart trips and stumbles and falls over once again. He stretches out his hand his fingers just inches away from Hectors cheek and Hector flinches stares at him in shock.Immediately Jude lowers his hand but it is already too late. He doesnt dare to look Hector in the eyes. He was never supposed to show him his feelings was never supposed to even have them but now Hector probably suspects the truth.Jude still makes him the sixth member of his Guard. Jude learns about Hectors past and he doesnt know what to do. He wants to comfort his best friend but no words seem good enough and touches arent allowed. So he just stays by his side and listens to him.She killed my family Hector says and his voice seems far far away. She killed my family but spared me. Im the only one she hasnt touched with her deadly hands.And Jude realizes that this is the reason why Hector acts the way he does why he seemed so shocked when Jude tried to touch him. It wasnt just because a single touch feels more intimate than a kiss. Its because a single touch killed everyone he cared about.It also explains why he joined the Order There he never has to be touched ever again. He is safe and doesnt have to worry about the Pale Hand.At least he wouldnt have to worry if fate hadnt decided otherwise. Jude looks at Hector from the side tries to read his thoughts tries to predict his plans. He doesnt succeed. He knows Hector for six years now but in this moment he might as well be a stranger.Jude hesitates. What will you do he asks quietly looking over the city from the roof theyre sitting on. Will you avenge your familyIt should be a stupid question something too ridiculous to consider. But Hectors expression makes it hard to tell. Jude is genuinely afraid of the answer afraid that Hector will give him the wrong one. Emotions mustnt influence a Paladins decisions. Because emotions will eventually lead to losing control allowing someone to cross the line between your duty and your heart.A line Jude himself has crossed.I dont know Hector finally says and Jude cant tell if hes lying or not. Maybe Hector doesnt know it either. His uncertainty worries and comforts Jude at the same time. Hector shouldnt be uncertain at all but at the same time being uncertain is still better than making the wrong decision.I trust you he says passionately and hopes his words help Hector somehow. I know youll do the right thing.Hector laughs but it doesnt sound happy at all. Im not like you Jude. You always knew what you wanted. You never doubted the Order or your fate. But I Jude sucks in a deep breath. Dont he begs quietly. Please dont say it. But of course Hector cant hear his silent plea.I had a past he says. A family. You will never understand how it feels to lose the most important people of your life.Jude flinches. He almost says Im about to. Because Hector is dangerously close to making a mistake. Closer than hed ever been. And all because of the Pale Hand.Youre right Jude says because he doesnt want to provoke him. I dont know what it feels like. And I dont want to know. Please Hector youre my friend. Dont show me how its like.But Hector doesnt answer. Jude touches Hectors cloak and his heart pumps in his chest. Penrose stays beside him looks at him with worrying eyes. He almost hears the words she doesnt say the You need to protect the Prophet and Hector broke his oath but even if shed spoken them Jude would not have listened.He has to find him.Jude knows he mustnt. He knows that Penroses unspoken words are true. He has a duty a purpose. Protecting the Prophet and aiding him on his quest to stop the Age of Darkness.But Judes fingers around Hectors cloak tighten. He cant leave him behind. They were together for six years. Even after they got separated during Judes Year of Reflection they found each other again. Jude cant let him leave now. He wont.He turns to Penrose and makes his decision. I need to find Hector before he does something stupid he says.Penroses eyes widen. She wants to stop him Jude feels it. So he goes before she gets the chance. He rushes to the Pale Hands cell begs her to tell him where her sister is because this is the place where Hector will be. She reluctantly agrees but only if Jude promises to protect her sister.He promises it.He will protect her sister and he will also protect Hector.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/31663064,In Between the Shadow,Act I Grace and Fire Chapter 1 Ephyra Shara Word of advice Never turn your back on lowlifes. Its something Shara had to learn as well so shes glad she can share this advice with others especially with such a suspicious looking girl. Not that Shara minds her appearance in fact she loves suspicious looking girls. She is already thrilled to learn her story although she would never admit that.Is that how your negotiations usually go the girl asks.Shara tries really hard not to flinch. The girl doesnt know that her question reminds Shara of Badis the Thief King and the love of her life. When they first met Shara was as naive as this girl is right now She got into a fight and was stupid enough not to turn around stupid enough to believe she already won. Badis backed her into a wall and disarmed her attacker quickly while Shara just stared at him with big eyes and a thrumming heart.After the attacker fled Badis asked her the same question the girl had asked just now. Is that how your negotiations usually goShara had replied You must be new here. They always go like this.And Badis had laughed and said Word of advice Never turn your back on lowlifes.That was the beginning of their companionship. Of Sharas crush. Of everything that led her to this moment meeting a girl thats so different from Badis but also more familiar than Shara wants to admit.She cant help but smile. You must be new here. What do you wantShe doesnt know what she expected but the answer still surprises her The girl searches for her. Treasure just needs to be valuable to the person giving it up. Before meeting Badis Shara had also thought that the value of a treasure was measured in coins and rare artifacts but Badis showed her quickly how wrong she was.You want to work with me he clarifies after Shara makes her request. To her surprise he shrugs as if Shara hadnt just given him a part of her heart. It beats faster when Badis responds Sure. But you have to give me something I return.Her heart plummets down again. I I dont have anything.Badis dismisses her words with a wave of his hand. Im not talking about money he clarifies. But something thats important to you. Give it to me and we have a deal.She thinks about it. At first nothing comes to mind but then her gaze wanders to her wrist where her mothers bracelet glitters in the setting suns light. She takes a deep breath and makes her decision.Here. It belonged to my mother.Badis takes it and Shara feels like she just betrayed the only person who ever cared about her. Badis doesnt seem to notice it however.Perfect he says. Youre part of our group now.Shara raises an eyebrow. GroupAnd then she meets the people who will soon become her best friends. Thats the mark of a criminal in Behezda. Sharas task is simple Scout Behezda and report everything noteworthy. There isnt much she does alone anymore not since she met her new friends but this task is an exception.What nobody told her however The small scar on her cheek the result of a stupid accident means something so much more in Behezda.Shara notices the suspicious looks but she doesnt think anything of it. She walks through the streets and acts like she belongs here while she observes the people and they observe her. Finally a young woman approaches her and Shara already opens her mouth to greet her but the woman interrupts her before she can even say a single word.What are you doing here Pack like you isnt welcome hereOutraged Shara folds her arms and shouts back Pack like me What do you mean Im just a visitorNo you are not. The woman points at Sharas cheek at her scar. Thats the mark of a criminal. Dont you know that girlReflexively Shara touches her cheek. Oh. No.The woman raises her eyebrows.

https://archiveofourown.org/works/31102808,Drown With Me,Chapter 1 I have to do this. Hes back.His lungs contract and Anton can barely breathe. Seeing the lake again is even worse than he expected. Memories assault him like his brother used to do horrible memories he wanted so badly to forget. He is shaking his knees give way under him but Jude doesnt let him fall. He is there by his side like always. He supports him in more ways than one. He is his one and only guardian.Anton loves him so much.His future and his past meet right here and now at the lake. Anton can almost taste the salty water can almost feel the relentless cold. But he can also smell Jude can hear his raging esha no matter how broken it currently is. His future and his past intertwined at the place Anton never wanted to see again. The place he will die in. Not in a year not in a month and not in a day but now. He made his choice. And this time he wont run away.He wants to cry. He wants to scream. But hes sick of crying so Anton laughs instead.Jude looks at him in shock but Anton doesnt care. Or at least he pretends he doesnt. He laughs and laughs and laughs he cant stop himself. Maybe he goes insane just like his ancestor. Maybe he already is insane. He is so afraid. Afraid of his past afraid of his vision afraid of his brother. And he just laughs laughs the fear away the pure horror that lies in front of him.Jude grabs his shoulders. Anton.Anton blinks stares at Judes face. What he asks aggressively. Dont you think its funny That I never wouldve come here if it werent for youJude flinches and Anton regrets his words immediately. He knows hes unfair. He knows that Jude isnt to blame. But he cant help it he has to channel his fear towards someone and Jude is the only possible candidate.Jude doesnt allow himself to get provoked though. He looks at him full of worry full of compassion. His fingertips graze Antons cheek a touch so soft that Anton closes his eyes in order to feel it fully. Judes breath tingles his nose Anton almost feels his lips on his. Almost.But Jude doesnt kiss him. Of course he doesnt. He reciprocates his feelings but he refuses to abandon his beliefs. The Orders beliefs Anton corrects himself. Jude will never act on his feelings will never do what he truly wants but Anton doesnt care. Or at least he pretends he doesnt.Im so scared he confesses. What should I do Jude What should I do He doesnt expect an answer but Jude gives him one anyway.Dont run away he says. Face your fears. Its the only way to overcome them.Its not that simple Jude.I know Jude reassures him. I know. His voice is as soft as his touch and Anton wants to kiss him so badly that it almost drives him insane. He wants to feel his lips wants to explore his body but as long as he doesnt make the first move those wishes will forever remain unfulfilled. He opens his eyes and gets lost in Judes an intense green that reminds him of so many things at once Fresh grass the depths of a forest the stormy sea.He wants to drown in them.Anton swallows and averts his gaze looks at the lake instead. No ice covers the dark water not now when summer dominates the country. Its like a message. Fate wants to make it easier for him. Fate wants him to die.Jude notices his gaze and blocks his view of the lake. His fingertips still caress Antons skin tickle it stroke it a warm comforting feeling. Anton wants him to never let go of him again wants to feel Judes presence for the rest of his life.A life that will find its end today.He forces himself to take a step back. Jude looks at him in wonder but theres also something else in his eyes something Anton cant identify. But he cant allow himself to think about it cant allow himself to feel hope. Because not even Jude will be able to save him from this. His past memories so many moments Anton wanted so badly to forget.He takes a few steps towards the lake.Jude tenses but he lets him go. Both of them know that he has to do this that theres no other way. He needs to drown. He needs to feel the fear in his lungs the water in his throat the cold overwhelming terror.He needs to die.But Jude doesnt know that. Anton didnt tell him. That he will sacrifice his own life in order to stop the Age of Darkness. Its something he never wouldve considered just a few weeks ago but he changed a lot since then. He met Jude. He fell in love with him. And he realized just how much hes willing to sacrifice for a world that isnt haunted by the darkness.A world for Jude.Water scratches his knees like thousand sharp blades slashing at him. Antons heart bursts fear rushes through his veins he cant breathe he cant live Suddenly he feels warm arms around him a storm surrounding him someone pulling him back away from the water away from the memories He breathes heavily nightmares still haunting his vision his brother drowning him no Anton drowning himself AntonJudes voice brings him back. Anton blinks multiple times and forces his Grace into the deeper realms of his mind until it finally retreats until it finally releases him.He looks at Jude fixes his gaze on his lips. Anton imagines leaning forward imagines kissing Jude imagines Jude kissing him back.Of course he doesnt. Its not the right time and not the right place. What they have now is not enough for neither of them but Anton cant risk asking for more cant risk sharing his motivations before knowing Judes. He doesnt want to lose him doesnt want to AntonJude sounds so incredibly worried as if he knows what Anton planned to do. Plans to do. Hes still determined to stop the Age of Darkness even if it breaks Judes heart even if he will never find out whether it worked or not.A part of him still wants to die.Im alright he lies. Sorry.Jude frowns. He doesnt believe him. Dont apologize for something that isnt your fault he says sternly. And dont lie to me.Anton shouldve known. Even without his Grace of Heart Jude can always tell when he lies. They know each other well enough. Jude is always able to call him out as long as he speaks his lies out loud. Maybe he should stop talking to him altogether. Maybe he never shouldve talked to him in the first place.Anton takes a deep breath and exhales just as slowly. He doesnt want to tell Jude the truth but he also doesnt want to lie anymore. But what choice does he have If he tells Jude the truth Jude will prevent him from sacrificing himself. He might even offer to do it instead. But if he lies to Jude again he will lose his trust his friendship maybe even his love.Anton looks at him and makes his decision.I cant tell you he says. I dont trust you enough.Jude bites his lip and looks away. Anton hurt him but he doesnt allow himself to regret it. He didnt have another choice. In fact its probably better this way. Hed rather push Jude away than losing him forever. It hurts him as much as it hurts Jude but if this is the price he has to pay in order to save him save everyone he will do it.Go he whispers. Leave me alone. Theres something I have to do.Jude doesnt move. I wont let you die Anton.He knows. Of course he knows. Anton smiles but its a fake smile a smile that hides his true feelings The fear and the love and the longing and everything in between. I have to do this he says. Its the only way to stop the Age of Darkness.Judes expression turns stone cold. I dont care he says and a storm roars in his eyes. I wont let you die. I cant let you die. There has to be another way.There isnt Anton replies. There never was. Let me drown Jude. My first vision showed me the world in ruin. My last vision will show me how to save it. I know it Jude.But Jude shakes his head. You dont know that he says and his voice shakes. And even if thats true how do you know that it requires your life How do you know that it will be enough You dont. Dont throw your life away with the sheer hope of it being worth it.Wouldnt be the first time Anton mutters. Jude just stares at him. Anton clears his throat and says I am the Prophet. It is my duty to protect you and everyone else.Jude laughs but he doesnt sound happy at all. Throwing my own words against me I see. What happened to the boy who would rather run away than confront his biggest fearHes gone Anton replies softly. You made him disappear.Jude presses his lips together. Dont do this he says his voice trembling in despair. Please Anton dont do this.Hes begging. He begs Anton for his own life. He realized that every attempt to convince him is fruitless so he simply pleads him to find another solution.But there isnt one. There isnt. Anton ran away for so many years from his memories and from his brother but now its finally time to face them both. One last vision to save the world one last vision to save Jude.I have to he whispers. I dont have a choice.Jude doesnt answer. He just stares at him his eyes full of unspoken words unspoken confessions. Its a last chance for both of them but Jude doesnt take it.So Anton does instead.Their kiss is full of despair and full of fear but Anton loves it nevertheless. He kisses Jude and Jude kisses him finally accepting his feelings. Antons heart feels like a young bird trying to fly in a storm. His Grace embraces Judes esha and Anton loses his breath but he doesnt care doesnt care as long as he can enjoy the feeling of Judes lips.Eventually they break away from each other and Anton immediately sees that his other plan worked. The plan he didnt even want to put into practice.Jude looks at him in shock and sinks to his knees. His fingers touch his lips and he looks so so betrayed. Anton wants to cry wants to apologize but no word escapes his lips.The lips he carefully coated with poison. Poison that numbs the body and makes it almost impossible to move.He looks at Jude and Jude looks back tries to say something but cant. Anton explains and every word breaks his heart I couldnt take the risk. You never wouldve let me die.He planned this for such a long time but a part of him hoped he wouldnt succeed. A part of him hoped that Jude would back away before the poison would affect him. But he didnt. Anton succeeded and now Jude has to pay for it.Not able to look at him any longer helpless and unable to move Anton turns toward the lake. His Grace feels a strange connection to its depths so much different than the connection to Judes esha but also not different at all. He cant explain it but it doesnt matter anyway. He will die now. He will die to save the world.The water welcomes him with reproaches and coldness asks him where he has been all those years but Anton doesnt answer. He feels Judes presence behind him a storm that threatens to blow him away. But Anton doesnt turn around. He is afraid of the water but hes even more afraid of losing Jude. He did the right thing. He feels dirty and guilty and like the worst person in the world but it was his only choice. Jude never wouldve let him die.He goes deeper into the water step by step by step. He holds his breath as it reaches his waist as it reaches his chest as it reaches his neck.He stops breathing when it swallows him whole.,Teen And Up Audiences,Alternate CanonAngstDramaProtectivenessattempted self-sacrificeDrowningFamilyBrothersChildhood MemoriesChildhood TraumaPast Child AbuseCardiopulmonary ResuscitationPromisesLGBTQ Character

https://archiveofourown.org/works/33562756,Open World: Happiness,We exited the portal like we had many planets before. I took in the scent of the air. Dry. Great. This is so great Heather another world. My boyfriend well more like my fiance Casey said from next to me. We were experienced travelers and had all we needed and nothing more really. We were Beastials Anthro Beastials. I was a Pureblooded Blacktip shark beastial anthro. Try saying that five times fast. Being anthro means I can live on the surface breath air all that. Just gotta drink lots of water. My hubby was a mix. Half fox Half racoon. He had the racoon patterns but the foxes colors and was a good half foot shorter than me. Making him fivefive. Brand new place to look around. I said honestly. Enjoy the sights sounds and many other things. Photos. Heh there it is. My love works as a Photographer for the Cartographers Guild. He gets photos of locations hard to get to and dungeons for them. Which is ironic given hes a passifict. Thats where I come in. Im his muscle and bodyguard. Heh have been since we were kids to tell you the truth. You and your photos. I couldnt help but giggle at his enthusiasm...only to trip over myself as the next thing I heard from his position was the sound of a camera taking snapshots. Well yeah. So many people just live normal lives even with all thats around us. Especially the Isekai. Casey said. He has an infatuation with them. The idea of being born in such simple worlds amazed him. Where did they come from and will they ever go back are among this worlds biggest mysteries. I mean that is true. I said honestly. But come on no need to take a picture of every square inch of the teleporter room. Heh just eager. Dechamor is still largely undiscovered. And since its a largely resource based world its got a lot of amazing natural spawned in structures and landscapes. From all the info about this planet we got that is a definite. I nodded in agreement. So where do you think we should set up camp Casey asked me as he opened up a map of the explored areas. Majority of these places are mining towns. Some castle ruins giant tree dungeon. Yeah theres a whole lot of places to check out. I said honestly thinking for a moment. What are you in the mood for to start Might as well start with that. Hmm Well there arent too many aquatic places listed. Maybe my sweet little fishy would like to go for a dip and maybe we can even discover something neat while down there. I smiled. Hes so sweet. You know just what to say. I smiled happily. Heh. I think I know just the place. He said showing me the map. Theres a large lake near a town called Coal Vein. The locals just use it for water and fishing and theres no official dives despite it being over fifty miles deep. Sounds like a plan. I nodded. Best get a ride to Coal Vein then. Got our ship right here. Casey said as he took out our ship. He got it as a replica of the Millennium Falcon. From one of my favorite movies. Upgraded the engine and gave it a Submersive upgrade for underwater. Amazing. I smiled. To get the good pictures underwater as well huh Well among other things He teased giving me a hug. I know you enjoy my shark form. Your shark form is great. I said as I hugged my hubby back. But no matter what form youre in I love you so much. I love you too babe. He said giving my cheek a kiss. Come on lets go find the flight deck and head off. And lets not spend a day and a half getting there because you keep photographing everything. I teased. Well I could just add to our private albums if you prefer I felt a jolt of excitement. The private albums were all of Casey and I being heh intimate. Or just sexy shots. Sound like a good way to spend a day and a half trip Oh yeah thats always time well spent. I smiled. With a smile and another kiss Casey and I headed for the flight deck and once the ship was out we got on and Casey set the coordinates. The flight would take a day so we headed off to some fun. The inside wasnt like the actual Millennium Falcon it was more modern like a house. Bedroom three bathrooms armory basement photo lab for Casey and indoor pools and gardens. We sat on the couch in the living room Casey already getting cuddly as I turned on the tv and began channel surfing. What you in the mood to watch I asked Casey. Hmm any comedies Well...want to see something old or new Surprise me. I filtered out for Comedies and put one on. Wale watched this channel for a few hours before we started dinner. Well we set the kitchen to auto cook then went back to watching TV. After dinner we got dressed for bed and were laying in bed. I was looking over the upgrade options for my Greatsword Old Faithful. Ive put a lot of time work and rem into the old girl. Casey was reading about the lake we were going to and the town it was near. Huh. Apparently Coal Vein is so rich in coal its just sticking out of the dirt in large clusters. Anyone with a pickaxe is free to mine it. Guess thats why its called Coal Vein just a massive vein of coal. I said honestly. Heh looks like. He said taking a few notes before putting the book down. He then got up to my side kissing my neck his coat tickling me. I couldnt help but giggle at his coat tickling me. Excited for tomorrow Hmmm Mostly just excited is all. He said starting to feel me up. I put Old Faithful away and joined in kissing his lips as we started getting into the mood. Tomorrow marks three hundred years dating Heather. Oh crap I forgot Three hundred years huh I whistled. Jeez it feels like only yesterday we were celebrating our hundred and fiftieth anniversary. I said honestly. iSaved like a boss.i I thought to myself proudly. Heh feels like yesterday your ball got kicked through the fence and broke my nose. Wed have never met had your brother not tried to show off. He laughed. Yeah he just had to show off. I chuckled. But...it was the best day of my life when I met you. Ditto. He said giving me another kiss. Heh three hundred years. Think maybe the next one can celebrate something more Something more I inquired. What do you have in mind Well He said scooting a bit away. Most other couples are well married by five years or ten and well He took a deep breath. Wait is he Well I probably should have asked much sooner but Heather I love you and weve known each other for the better part of eight hundred years and dated for three hundred we both have an eternity ahead of us and I want you there with me as my wife. He said his hand flashing as he showed me a ring. Gold with the gems being two diamonds cut into the shape of a shark tooth. Heather Jasmine will you marry me Yes I shouted in pure joy tears in my eyes as I hugged Casey. Yes yes a million times yes. He hugged me back. We shared a kiss and I took the ring putting it on. Enchantment Detected Hydro Absorbent. When in dry climates or hot environments your body retains water and your body feels the temperature as normal. Rreally I asked in surprise. When did you get a Hydro Absorbent enchantment on this thing After our trip to Valthra and with how bad you handled the heat I paid for it from some of the Desert Explorers Guild. Room a while to nab the proper materials for the enchantment without you getting suspicious. Ive actually had the ring for the last two hundred years He said with a blush. I just kept getting cold feet when I tried asking before He said sheepishly. So thats why you sometimes looked either jumpy or sad I said in small realization. Heh yeah Im so happy I finally got that off my chest. He said climbing on top of me and planting a strong kiss I melted into. I wrapped my arms around Casey so thankful to finally call my trash panda of a fiance my husband. The passion that night was stronger than usual. For obvious reasons. When we woke up the next morning we started the day off taking showers then changing the bedsheets. So it was a good morning. We had a good breakfast and still had a few hours left before we were at the lake. So I booted up my computer and began playing some old favorites that have kept popular. Casey was well being the woman in this case and trying to plan out the wedding. I love them and for as long as I can remember Casey has been more the female in the relationship despite me packing the female figure and genitals. So parents and siblings are a must but how many of our friends should we invite Where can we even find a space big enough for that Casey asked as he was already making invite lists. We could probably rent out a party venue for that. I brought up. Most of those are already prebuilt to be the size of however many party goers are if memory serves. True Should we go classical traditional something modern Given your probably going to litter the place with Cameras what do you think I asked. Which will give us the best pictures Its more about the event itself over the photos. Casey said. Hearing him say that was like hearing a tree say it liked being on fire. It just didnt happen. Its our special night after all. Never before would I hear you say no pictures just party. I said in honest surprise. Well there will be but its our night so I shouldnt spend it taking all the photos. I know a few people who can take care of that that way I can focus on you and only you babe. Youre amazing. I smiled in pure joy. Hmm...when in doubt Traditional is always a safe bet. Seeing you in a white dress does make for a beautiful thought. Should be on a beach then to best cater to your family too. He said taking notes. Heh so when should we tell everyone anyway I imagine our parents will be thrilled that their oldest kids are finally getting married. Heh I know moms been trying to get us to have kids for the last hundred years. Trust me my parents have also been hounding me to have grandkids either by riding you till you cant move or making you my woman...their words not mine. I said sheepishly. Well we have explored a lot of our fetishes and I wouldnt mind They teased as they wrote down some more. Though it would be nice little half shark quarter fox quarter racoons running and swimming around. I mean hell my younger sister is only two hundred and she already got married and has her fifteenth child. Sounds about right. I nodded. She always was happy to do that kind of stuff. If we do have kids though wed need a babysitter or maybe a servant class Hmm Maybe. In all our adventures weve gotten a few Prize Pod People but we rarely opened them. We mostly just dropped them off at the Matchmakers Guild. That is true. I said with some thought. Still feel a little bad to just drop off those Prize Pods at the Matchmakers Guild though Well we never really needed help and well when it came to the Lover Class ones I dont think thats a good idea. I mean how long did it take us to start dating Then me asking you to marry me plus you are pretty protective and aggressive when it comes to me. Yeah I sighed out. But...well we dont need a massive harem when we have each other. Yeah. No need to turn out like your brother and his what two hundred wives and fifty husbands Ill at least take some credit in finally getting the guy to stop lying to himself about being Bi. I shrugged. Heh these days who isnt Casey laughed. I guess we should start opening those pods then. So what are you playing anyway Final Fantasy 9. I said honestly. Ah yes the game whos weapons still escape your collection. I sighed. I love video games and in this reality all forms of media are worlds and places and the like and that includes their weapons. I collect them. They are cool like that but some keep escaping me. Still have no idea where the hell Excalibur II is. I grumbled. In game you need to get to the final dungeon in less than 12 hours of play...it just has to be damn near impossible to find in real life. I grumbled. And the people who do have it arent selling. Casey said with a chuckle. Maybe its just dumb luck Theres that then others said they got it from a special event in certain dungeons and I havent seen any of them. I groaned. Why does weapon collecting have to be such a bitch Because some weapons are more powerful than others More like some are just outrageously difficult to find. I groaned. I know Im looking for an Ultimate class weapon half the time but come on As I played video games Casey tossed ideas for the wedding back and forth and before we knew it we were at the lake. The air smelled pure and clean the ship parked just before the lakes edge and we got a good view. It was four miles wide and fifty miles deep and ran for the next two million miles. It was pure clean water and tasted high in iron and potassium. Plenty of fish I could see from just the surface water was a lot of trout and some salmon. Yummy. So shall we take the dive or shall we have a little fun first Casey asked as he saw my more primal instincts begging me to jump in for a swim and to hunt for fish. Lets have some fun first. I said licking my lips as I was eager for some fresh fish. I jumped in the water hitting my skin and triggering basic instincts as I swam at speeds only one who is aquatic can reach. My first prey was a small mouth fish tried to swim away but my teeth grabbed it before it could turn around and I munched it bones and all. Being a bestial who is a predator a hunter theres a unique relationship between my feral family and my sentient one. Im smart intelligent yet I can enjoy and see the value in a hunt a fresh kill. Raw meat. It satisfies a more primal side all beastials who are carnivorous have and have to learn to live with. So while I can enjoy bread or soda or fried chicken as much as anyone else raw meat still has a flavor unique all its own only a carnivore can taste. Once that little snack was done I looked around for the next snack. Oh catfish. Yummy. After hunting around in the water for a good half hour I broke the surface seeing Casey using a fishing pole and had a bucket with quite a few fish in it. You look happy. He said my recent catch a striped bass still flapping in my teeth as I swam over to him I grabbed the fish in my mouth and put it in the bucket. Yep havent had a good simple swimming hunt in a while plus the fish are great. Heh happy to hear. So what did you catch so far I asked simply. Bass a few catfish. This Threadfin Shad. He said showing me the small fish. It was descaled and the meat munched away leaving only the skeleton and head. Casey being part fox and racoon was an omnivore through and through. I can eat veggies and all that fine but Casey was able to manage both and didnt really have a primal desire to hunt. Sure he did it for the experience a few times but being a natural omnivore he lacked that hunters drive. Still cooked or raw plants or meat he was able to enjoy the taste as well. How was the Threadfin I asked curiously. Not bad needed some salt. He said tossing the bones aside. Ill probably cook these over a fire then we can start the dive and hopefully find something cool down there. Or something creepy...cause for some reason all the creepy shit just has to be underwater. I sighed out. Well youll be down there so at least there will be something beautiful and sexy down there. He said giving me a kiss as he helped me onto the shoar. Ill go grab firewood if you dig the pit for the fire. Alright. I nodded as I started to dry myself off a bit just to get most of the excess water off me before digging the fire pit. Casey got up and ran off to the nearby trees and quickly gathered lots of burnables as I made a sizable pit and managed to get some rocks to line the edges. Casey came back and started the fire and we began setting up the fish to cook. It smelled good but I did munch on a few raw before eating a cooked one. With our bellies full we then prepared for the dive down Casey switching to his profile of the same shark race as me. He was the same colors size just a shark like me and oooohhhh Do his abs show when hes a shark like me. Good lord you can grate cheese on those abs. I blushed at how...buff Casey was in his shark form. Heh well having a fur coat does normally hide them. He blushed but tried to give me a bit of a show before taking out his deep sea camera. The lake is between a safe zone and hazard zone so about halfway through it we should find something. Or maybe just cool stuff. Ready babe Im always ready. I said with pride. With a splash we jumped in and began swimming down. Being aquatic beings our eyes can easily adjust to the darkness and so long as you are an aquatic race you can dive as deep as you want without issue. Its a nice little touch The Mother did. Once we got down into the dark we kept close to the edge and as our eyes adjusted we spotted many rocks moss some bottom feeders tree branches. So far just the usual. Casey said. Being Aquatic when Casey takes this form too we can both talk under water. Just one of the perks. A bit more trees than I first thought. I brought up. Casey took a few photos and I noticed something sticking out of the ground. I pulled it out of the mud and looked it over. It was a rusty sword the handle rotted off and the blade chipped to hell. Huh looks like something Junker John would like. I chuckled yeah. Junker John was an Izikai we met about ten years back. He was traveling around for well junk items like this to restore. He was an interesting guy. Can fix just about anything. Wonder what thisll be when we get it to him I said honestly Probably something very shiny and nice. Casey said as we put it away and kept on moving. More random things were appearing. Some junk some bits of ore and gems here and there. Usual stuff youd find underground too Holy shit Youre seeing that too right Casey asked as he took photos of the massive three story wooden ship resting on the lakebed. Yeah...Im seeing this. I said in pure shock. The hell is this doing here Must have spawned here. You almost never see ships that big in lakes or ponds. We walked up to it. It had a few holes inside that we entered through. The button floor was filled with rusty cannons rotting equipment some various skeletons. Gross Casey said taking photos of everything. As you continue to take pictures of the gross things. I joked moving around carefully to see if there was any markings to show who owned the ship or what the name of it was. There wasnt anything sadly. Most of the crates were all trash Hello. I pulled the lid off a rotten crate finding ten bottles of still corked wine. Scan showed that not only were they still perfectly preserved but are aged two hundred years and worth two grand each. Oh this is so going with dinner tonight Amazing wine find. I said happily collecting the ten bottles and putting them away in my assistant. Sweet. Cant wait to try it out. Casey said as he swam around looking through various broken and rotted crates. Hm some gold coins here. He said pulling up a small box with probably fifty gold coins. I think this might have been a cargo ship. The hells a cargo ship doing here of all places I wondered. Meh. Casey shrugged. The other crates all were broken or rusted to death. We swam up and managed to find a supply of gemstones and rusty ingots. Most everything was rusted but salvageable. The next floor was mostly bones and such. There was an office where a skeleton sat in the desk chair with a large glowing red sword impaling its rib cage. Ouch. Casey said taking several photos. I swam up to the sword seeing its red glow and the water around it was hot. Almost boiling Holy crap this sword is made from Fire Gems. Holy damn someone must have really wanted to see the limits of fire gems in a sword. I said as I carefully grabbed the swords hilt and pulled it out of the skeleton. The blade pulsated keeping a steady heat as the hilt remained cool to the touch. Huh you dont see those all that much. Casey said swimming around me and looking at the sword. Didnt John say theyre kinda fragile Considering its majority fire gems...probably. I said as I used my Scan ability to look over this fire sword. Elemental Gem Sword Fire A sword made from pure Elemental Fire Gems. Att 30 Mag 200 Ability Pyromaniacs Flame All fire based spells and abilities are tripled in damage and halved in MP cost when attacking with this sword. Well if you ever needed to be a fire mage and needed a good fire based weapon this is it. I said honestly. Into the collection then Yep. I said as I put it away. Might figure something out but Im not really good with fire spells. Hm. Well this looks like everything this shipwreck has to offer maybe we can Sweet Mothers Tits Woah a swear like that means his mind was blown. I swam over to the window Casey was looking out of and Sweet Mothers Tits It was a whole sunken city like an actual city Skyscrapers and everything Excuse me...but how and why I asked in honest surprise. This has been down here the whole time and no one knew because they didnt bother diving down here Casey said taking pictures from where we were. This is amazing Weve seen a lot of ruined cities but never one thats completely submerged underwater Want to see if its a functioning sunken city I asked. Yes We swam over to it and once we crossed into the city limits we got a notification. Now entering Hazard Zones. Oh so this city is a dungeon. Well...didnt expect this place to be a dungeon thats for sure. I said pulling out Old Faithful and preparing for a fight. Huh that would make sense most ruined cities are. I wonder what kind of monsters spawn hereahh I spun around seeing a giant twenty eyed squid grabbing Casey by the leg. Ask and you shall receive He yelped as it spun him around like a yoyo. Oi Get your damned tentacle off my husband I shouted as I bolted forward swinging Old Faithful and cutting the tentacle holding Casey clean off. The beast roared at it and began to attack. Experience guiding me to a rapid spin that let me slice off all its attacking appendages before swimming in fast for a slice across its giant head. It died roaring as its guts and blood filled the nearby water. I got two thousand rem for that kill sweet Oh and ink. Eh. You okay there Casey I called out worriedly looking over to where he was spun around like a yoyo. Just dizzy. He said still spinning backwards where he floated in the water. Didnt barf this time so thats a win He said trying to keep himself still. I swam over and helped him before we continued on. That was epic hun. Yep. I said with a smile. Thanks to Old Faithful here. Heh yeah. I owe my ass to that sword about as much as you. He chuckled. In more ways than one hot stuff. I said as I swam over and gave Caseys ass a little smack. Yip He yipped. I laughed. That never gets old. Ill never understand how you can enjoy that without a fur coat. Eh you get used to it. I shrugged. Continuing on we swam through the city I was fighting off monsters and Casey was either photographing or healing me. He was my healer and knew a wide variety of healing spells status curing spells and had a large library of potions. We came across an old cop car and once I pried it from the skeletons hands I had myself a pretty neat crossbow. Neat. I said honestly. So hows your photography coming And hows your MP Good I always pack MP potions. He said. And so far these shots are great. The Cartographers Guild is going to be happy to see all this. Honestly if Photo Finish wasnt constantly on the move Im pretty sure youd be the best Photographer ever. I said honestly that mare being one of the few rumored to have existed since before everything existed but she never answered nor even wanted to share the photos she has actively stated she has. Eh. I think we can just get a few more photos in then head back and camp out til tomorrow. I can send what I got to the guild and we can relax some. Works for me. I shrugged. Depending on how deep we go we might find a miniboss. With a nod we swam further in looking around til I spotted a large clam just sitting atop an ambulance. Im betting its not holding a giant pearl. Casey said. Want to find out whats in it I asked gripping Old Faithful a little tighter. Might as well. He said taking a photo of it. Might be a miniboss. Alright. I rolled my shoulders as I started to swim carefully towards the giant clam. Once I was up to it I jammed the tip of Old Faithful into the crack of it and began prying it open. After a few hard kicks and pulls the mouth opened wide and the clams maw revealed a Prize Pod. The kind for people. Well thats unexpected Casey said as he swam up next to me. Huh I blinked. Didnt expect this I hummed as I swam over to the Prize Pod. Well...lets see who the person is. We looked at the symbole atop the pod. It was a rattle. Rattle thats Lover Class but a child. A baby. Its a kid. Casey said looking over the pod. Holy you these are rare. This would be our kid Our...child I teared up thinking of how amazing this chance is. Lets...lets try opening it...together. Wait. He said. Lets take it top side. Just in case theyre not aquatic. I nodded carefully Casey and I swimming the pod up and back to the shoar. Once it was up there we were holding each others hand. So we do this we heh we will be parents. Heh at least our parents will be happy about that This is...honestly going to be the happiest moment of my life. I said softly. God...how am I gonna take care of a kid...how are we going to feed them Im shark and...while I have amazing tits...I dont fully remember if I even can produce breast milk Well if theyre like you that wont be an issue and if theyre like me well well just go shopping. Casey said a flash and he was back to the fluffy half and half I loved. And if theyre some other race entirely well adjust. He took a deep breath. So ready Ready as Ill ever be. I said with a nervous smile. Slowly we both put a hand on the pod. It opened in a hiss of cool steam. Inside was a tiny little fluff ball a dark blue coat. They were a wolf. Child Adopted Genetic Markers set. Name Hex Gender Male Race Zerkalfer Dire Wolf Mother Set Heather Jasmine Father Set Casey Harper Age One Week Hes so fluffy Hes so adorable and fluffy I cooed in pure joy at how adorable he was. Hes so tiny and a Zerkalfer Dire Wolf he is gonna get huge. Casey breathed. Carefully he lifted the pup up and out the pod. The little one stirred and looked at us with theirtheir eyes. Theyre Like mine. Dark green. Awh Were parents Heather Casey said as he rubbed the pups belly. I I started tearing up even more. I...this is amazing Casey. Well come on take him. He said handing little Hex to me. Holding them they felt so fragile. So small. Their size felt sixty percent fluff. They sniffed my hand then gave it a lick as they nuzzled into my arms. Heh he knows who his mama is. Hes all fluff. I giggled cradling the pup carefully. Guess we best settle down then. Wow heh theres a sentence I never imagined saying Why dont we stay here The lake has plenty of fish clean water and the ship is a perfect home already. Woods nearby so he can learn to hunt like the little wolf he is and after I send these photos in we can live off our savings for a while. Make extra selling fish or whatever that dungeon down there has. Casey said wiping a tear off his eye. Its nice here. It...it really is. I said with a smile. Maybe if we find a Servant class they can stay with them while we work when they get older. Lets us keep working and exploring and when theyre old enough we can take him with us. That sounds amazing. I said warmly. Heh. Guess we better get some baby stuff then. Shopping in Coal Vein we got a lot of baby formula lots of bottles some parenting books and a book on raising Hexs particular race of wolf toys crib blankets baby clothes and the works really. We set up Hexs Crib in our bedroom and once it was built we put the blanket and pillow in there and lastly we started on feeding Hex. Apparently a Zerkalfer Dire Wolf pup drinks up to their body weight in milk a day and will continue to do so even after theyve grown their teeth in until they reach age two The little baby drank about five bottles before stopping. Thankfully he didnt barf when he burped and we carefully laid him to sleep. The full tummy helped lull him into slumber. Thank the Mother a majority of these stuff was free. I sighed out thankfully. Or cheap. Casey added as we sat on the bed. Guess we best call the folks sooner than expected. Mother help us theyre gonna move here when we tell them. Oh yeah. I chuckled. Theyll probably spoil the crap out of Hex. Heh yeah. Oh god and his aunts and uncles cousins He gave out a deep sigh. Bet you anything theyll still want you to birth a kid or two thousand. He laughed. Think well turn out like them when Hex is all grown up Im pretty sure. I chuckled. But...jeez...today is just one amazing thing after another. Yeah no kidding. He gave a yawn. Ill go compile and send the photos in after that we can go to bed. He said giving me a kiss before getting up and heading to his photo lab. Alright. I yawned as well. Jeez...all this excitement is tiring I looked over at Hex the little pup sound asleep for now. Oh I hope he isnt too much of a crier. I simply stared at the pup blocking out the world as I looked at my baby. My baby. Heh. My baby I giggled into a pillow out of pure joy. It was a little while before Casey returned and when he did we both laid in bed just the right way to look at Next as they slept. As per usual I was the big spoon here. I wonder what hes dreaming about Casey asked as he held my arms that wrapped around him. No idea. Maybe hes running around in a field or something. I shrugged. But...our baby Heh yeah. Our baby. He said the two of us just watched Hex until we fell asleep. One Month Later Mmmmhhhh Awooooo Shit I jumped up and Shit I sat back down as I looked where I stepped ouch so thats where that toy went fuck my foot Im up Casey said from the floor next to Hexs Crib. Awooooo Hex howled. Hes been howling every night at 3 am exactly every. Single. Night. Why does he keep doing this I grumbled in tiredness. I know hes a wolf but...sweet mother Im more curious how he can always tell when its three am. Casey said as he pat Hex on the head. It didnt stop him for long but it helped to calm him down and eventually put him back to bed. Awooooo Hex howled again. I got up and was going to grab another bottle of formula hoping a full belly and a burp can help quicken his return to sleep when I suddenly felt nauseous. Ugh come on Im not that oh no I quickly made it to the bathroom sink where I coughed up some rancid bile. You okay Casey asked as he ran over and rubbed my back. It cant be this soon I coughed. Well...you got a pregnancy test on ya Uh no wait you think Awooooo I think so I said weakly. After some quick searching I managed to find one and was waiting for the results with Casey while Holding Hex in my arms. At least he wasnt howling anymore but he wont go back to sleep. How many do you think it will be Casey asked. Shark species our primal cousins typically have many eggs fertilized internally they hatch and well natural selection and such. My intelligent species works similar yet different. We still can have many eggs fertilized and the babies hatch and grow internally but rather than eating their unborn siblings my womb will secret a yolk like substance that feeds them til they are born. It helps that they also dont grow teeth until after being born too. Still keeping that in mind a female like myself can carry up to ten at a time while pregnant. I dont know... well just have to wait and see. I said honestly. After the time finally was up I looked at the results pregnant Heh wow Casey breathed. Guess someone in The Family really wanted us to settle down huh He laughed weakly. I can certainly believe that. I laughed just as nervously. He gave out a long sigh. Guess we really will need those Servant class helpers then. Hex is a handful alone. Oh yeah...and we barely know why hes howling a whole lot. I said honestly. Casey sighed. Guess we should also tell the folks. I know theyll be thrilled by the news. At the very least they can help out with Hex and the ones to come. He said putting a hand over my belly. Guess well have to go to the doctors to see how many eggs you got in there huh Hopefully they know Shark Bestial biology. I said honestly. Im pretty sure they will. So call the folks now or try and wait for morning He asked giving a pat to Hex who ate up the attention. Its still three in the morning I started. I doubt any of them are awake to be honest. Maybe. Ill send out a message to them anyway. Casey said as he typed out the message on his Assistant and sent it to our parents. If we wake up with them banging down the door at least well know why. He yawned. We both fell back onto the bed and before we could even put Hex back in his Crib we were out cold. BangBangBang. Heh called it Casey said as he sat up. Opening my eyes I saw oh Mother that is cute. Hex was asleep atop his Papas head almost like a hat. Absolutely adorable. I giggled. Jeez...couldnt have given us a little longer to sleep I grumbled at our possible parents being here already. Well it is noon already Casey said motioning to the clock as he pulled Hex off his head and put them into my arms. Come on then babe lets go face the music. And the music is going to be my mom squealing like a mad woman. I chuckled knowing she would probably be the most happy about this considering how much she nagged me about it. And my dad declaring me a man finally. He laughed. We headed down and once the door opened Casey was pounced on by a taller vexen that spun him around in a rib crushing hug. My babys a dad Im a grandma By both my children His mom yelled. His mom and dad were both taller than him about my height and his mom had a figure I envy. I mean I have curves but Id kill for her ass. To have on me not to no. You know what I mean Mom Air Casey wheezed before finally getting dropped. Thank you. Well can you blame her Been waiting for this day for centuries. Caseys dad a raccoon with physical features similar to Casey just smoother said as he walked up giving his son a hug. So youre finally a man huh Dad Casey growled. Hey I tease I tease. This is him Caseys mom asked as she looked at the little fluff ball in my arms. Hex had woken up at this point and looked at the two newcomers with typical childlike curiosity and caution. Yep. I nodded. Hex meet your Grandma and Grandpa. I said softly to my little fluffball. Awh. Hi there sweetie. Im your Grandma Hannah. Caseys mom said. And Im your Grandpa Sheldon. Caseys dad added. Hex spent a while sniffing them both. After a bit I let Hannah hold him. Hex proceeded to stare blankly at her. Heh so adorable. She said. And he was in a prize pod Casey and I nodded. Inside a clam in that very lake over there. He informed. An entire sunken city hazard zone to be more specific. I added. Wow look at you two making amazing discoveries. Hannah said as she gave us both a hug. It was pretty amazing. I said with a smile. Heh so wheres your parents then Heather Sheldon asked. Honestly I expected them to be here. My babys pregnant Came the...very familiar sound of my mother who came barging in. Speak of the devil and they shall appear. I sighed out. Hey mom. My mom and dad are both Blacktip shark anthro beastials like me. Mom and I were very similar in our looks save for she had a wig for some brunet hair. Dad was mostly just tall and buff. Mom hugged me tightly. Oh I prayed for this day to come She said tears of pure joy trailing out her eyes. Rebecca please. Shes carrying precious cargo. My dad said. Oh but Travis Mom whined. Both outside and inside. I said honestly. But...yeah its been a long time in the making...but when Casey finally proposed...I suppose it was bound to happen. And its about time he finally popped that question. Sheldon said giving his son a hard pat on the back. Took ya long enough. Dad Casey huffed. He took a deep breath. So how long are you all going to be stay Moved into a nice little instant house next door we just set up. Hannah said. And we set up a lovely little place under the lake in the safe area for us. Mom said. Its so lovely down there. The second we saw the water I knew where we were setting up our home. Well...we might not entirely need babysitters or servant class if our parents are here. I said sheepishly. Oh trust me were expecting a lot of grandkids out of you two and its not like weve stopped. Dad said making me blush. Oh I have been trying to get Sheldon to have some more but hes such a traditionalist. Hannah said with a sigh. Tradition isnt always a bad thing. I mentioned. After a bit of back and forth we all eventually sat down as my mom and Caseys mom began making some food. I was bottle feeding Hex trying to stay awake as I did. Heh need some help there sweetie Dad asked as I tried shaking off the sleepiness. I can totally uh...deal with a massive lack of sleep cause he keeps howling at 3 in the morning. I yawned. Dad chuckled. Hehe yeah all kids have the dead of night whales. For you youd start teething on your crib. Had to get you a metal one. Dad laughed. Casey would fill his diaper and then cry til we changed him every night around five in the morning. Sheldon added and laughed. God I groaned in embarrassment not liking to hear our embarrassing baby actions. Embarrassing baby stories aside how have you been dad Casey asked. Pretty good. Got a job at the quiver store. Kinda boring but its easy work really. Caseys dad said. Im thinking about picking back up on dungeon crawling. Dad said. That dungeon down there sounds perfect for me and if it drops good stuff I can make a fair amount of cash on the market selling the excess loot. We would have done the same but...well I softly put a hand on my stomach. Gotta make sure my kids are safe. Right I forget Caseys a pacifist. Dad said. I just dont like fighting. Casey said. Shame really your talent for magic is just like your grandpa. Sheldon said with a sigh. Best mage of his time. How is your old man anyway Dad asked. Retired on Homeworlds Moon. Got a nice place up there. Thats good to hear. I nodded. Good to know Grandpa is doing well still. Casey said. The food came and finally Casey and I got to eat. Our parents said theyd look after Hex so Casey and I can catch up on sleep. Once we were out we woke up in the realm of dreams and while we tried to have fun I wasnt able to. I already miss Hex... Why cant I hold my little fluffball here as well I pouted. Hes still too young to show up here hun. He needs to be at least four to manifest here. Casey said as he held my hand while we walked the streets. We can do something here though that will knock a few options off the checklist. Cant wait to have some fun in the dream world with you again hun. I said warmly. Now...where to even start here Depends what shall we do for fun weve already done a lot before. Well...one thing we can do in the dream world is check how many kids were going to have. I brought up. That might be a first thing to do here. True but honestly that kind takes the wonder out of it. Or are you talking about how many kids this pregnancy This pregnancy. I told him simply. Im not gonna ask how many kids Ill have in the future that would be a nightmare and a half to know that right off. Heh fair. He said as we made our way to the tents area and found a Time Walker tent. We didnt go in here much. Usually when we did we asked basic things like if this area was a good exploration or not. Are you both ready The Time Walker asked. Ready as well ever be. I nodded. Yes. Casey said. The Time Walker nodded raising his Keyblade as soon two books one with my name and one with Caseys appeared on the table before us. When he opened both we watched as pages suddenly flew out of both and formed a new book. Normally the books that tell your life story are pure black with only your name written in silver atop the cover and spine. This book was all white with the image of a tree atop its cover. He picked it up and opened it. Hmm including that puppy you adopted you will have six children. Five babies woah. Casey said. I gulped. I took health class and sex ed in school and ouch... This is...gonna kind of suck for me when that time comes I muttered nervously. But...its gonna be a happy one. Indeed. Though a little advice. The Time Walker said as he closed the book. Travel. Casey and I gave each other a confused look. Uh not to disrespect sir but all Heather and I ever did is travel. True but trust me dont stop just because you have kids now just remember that when your travels end always return home. Time Walkers. Ever the cryptics. I also recommend this place. He said handing us a card with an address on it. Uh...sure. I said while taking the card and looking it over. But...wouldnt traveling while pregnant be...dangerous still If its to dungeons yes but you two travel to see the new and unexplored. Its time you both finally took in what already is. So we can travel just no dungeons. Casey said. Yup. The Time Walker stated. We gave one another a second look to each other before taking our leave. Time Walkers. Youll never get a straight answer out of them. That Yup was the only clear thing he said. As we headed towards the address I noticed some other numbers on it. Hmm weird. So where do you think hes sending us Casey asked. No idea. I said while looking over the card again. Now wheres the place were going to Looking at the streets I realized we were in the gambling district. Rem here was lost faster than anywhere else in reality sleeping or waking. Doesnt mean you couldnt leave here rich either. It was all up to the Admin of Luck. She personally oversaw these types of places. Her and her Guild the Golden Clovers. No casino in existence wasnt run by a member of Lady Lucks Guild. Huh last time we were in a casino was that undead infected city dungeon back on Armageddon. Now that was a fun time. I chuckled at how I got to strut my stuff with Old Faithful. After walking through this street around enough we spotted a unique machine. Enter a string of numbers and win a prize. Oh so thats what they are for. Also weird gambling game. We put in the numbers and hit enter. The machine popped out a small plastic egg. Written on the plastic was Open when Awake. Huh When Casey and I did wake up feeling a million times better we opened that egg. A summoning stone Huh wasnt expecting that. Casey said as he lifted the stone up. It was engraved heavily with all sorts of old runes and seemed to radiate way more power than normal for a summoning stone. So...why the heck are we getting an ancient summoning stone I frowned trying to scan the old as crap thing. It wasnt showing up in any Summoners or Familiars guild databases. One way to find out. Might as well. I nodded trying to use the summoning stone. Using these things is easy. Just squeeze them. Casey and I both have the stone and a strong press between our hands. It faded as the summon or familiar began to manifest. They were interesting. They were a Zerkalfer Den Mother Dire Wolf. Easily identifiable by the eight knockers on her chest well torso. She stood at about seven feet tall and wore a dark bluegrey dress that fit her lose and freely. She had a white bow just above the right ear and bright and attention grabbing yellow eyes. Hello how are you two doing today The Den Mother asked politely. Uh who are you Casey asked surprised as much as I was at who this summon is. Most arent so well anthro looking. My name is Nanny a Den Mother. She introduced herself politely. Uh...huh I started. Its nice to meet you Nanny...rather to the point with the name. So youre a summon thats more like a Servant Class pod person then Casey asked. Yep. She said with a nod. Then...why did the Time Walkers effectively give us something that we could have literally just gotten from the Matchmakers Guild I asked now honestly confused by that. Time Walkers always know what their doing...always being vague. Nanny said rolling her eyes like a mother would to a child doing something silly. Huh. So youre a Nanny then that is going to come in handy. Casey said with a sigh. Awooo Howled Hex. Is it three AM already I looked at Hexs Crib the small pup was running in a circle in there. Oh sounds like someones hungry. Nanny said as she was already moving through the kitchen. Does he need breastmilk or formula Nanny inquired. Well wait youre also a wet nurse Casey asked. What kind of Den Mother would I be if I wasnt one Nanny asked curiously. Well fair enough But weve only been able to give him formula given...my race. I brought up which saddened me a little but biology was a bitch. Oh you poor dear Nanny said softly her voice sympathetic to my plight as a mother. I understand but how old is young Hex if I may inquire She asked curiously. Little over a month now. When he came out of the pod it stated he was a week old. Casey said. Say do you know why he howls at 3am every night Oh thats a pack instinct. Nanny said while moving over to the howling pup. He wants attention and cuddles which in normal dire wolf situations they would have been sleeping together instead of separately. She explained. Really Casey asked. Makes sense I suppose. I brought up. Wolves are pack animals they eat and sleep together no matter where they are or go. I mentioned having studied them in case I had to fight them in Dungeons which I have several times. So to stop that we just have Hex sleep in the same bed as us then Huh would have been nice to know that a month ago It would have I sighed out. Its alright. Nanny said softly as she cradled Hex. Being a first time parent is always the most challenging when it comes to raising a child especially one of a different race. With a sigh Casey and I showed Nanny around and introduced her to our parents. With that all done she fed Hex and now I was holding the napping pup while Casey and I watched some TV. Nanny was more than just a nanny. She cleaned cooks and does just about anything household wise. Its still pretty weird right Casey asked. All this Yeah...I certainly didnt expect this. I agreed. But...its also really weird why we got that ancient summoning stone for...what could have amounted to a normal Servant Class Prize Person. I said my inner dungeon crawler still curious as to why we needed something super special from the Time Walkers themselves to just having a normal Den Mother as a familiar. Well whatever the case at least shes good at what she does and frankly were gonna need her help Mother only knows whats ahead of us family wise. Casey said placing a hand over my belly. Cause who knows how many more might pop up. Heh guess were gonna become our parents huh Who knows. I said putting a hand over Caseys. All I know is that things are going to get even better. Its definitely going to get interesting. Hopefully well be good parents. I know we will. I said warmly. But...what will our kids be like Thats the worrying question Well from how Hex is Id say hell be a spitfire. And for those yet to arrive well theyll have your strength loyalties compassion. My curiosity excitability. Id say theyll be great adventures. If not theyll still be good people and thats all that really matters. Yep. I nodded with a smile. I wonder how fluffy theyll be though even though theyre only a quarter racoon and fox. Depends. They might be full of fluff or have barely any. Guess well just have to wait and see. Alright. I nodded. Were gonna need to baby proof a whole lot of things though...mostly from teething I said nervously kind of worried at how sharp teeth are going to suddenly come up in the near future. Heh fair enough. I felt content like this. Our lives were changing and yet things felt fine. Im happy and thats all I could want out of life.,Teen And Up Audiences,CrossoverCrossovers & Fandom FusionsSlice of LifeAdventure
https://archiveofourown.org/works/33562213,Open World: Heroes,Can a person without a quirk become a hero Before me stood my idol my hero. Well everyones idol and hero. The most powerful hero in the world. All Might. He turned to me not a full turn around just enough so he could see me with one eye. ... Im sorry. But someone without a Quirk can not become a hero. With that All Might my hero shattered my last bit of hope in my already hopeless life. He jumped a gust of wind nearly knocking me over as he soared over the buildings to take that sludge villain into custody. With him gone I walked to the edge of the roof. The safety railing wasnt tall enough to lean on not meant to be up here at all. I stepped over it looking at the ground below. People walking about no one who can fly it seems. I looked to the right to the left. Looks like theres no heroes nearby. If you think youll have a quirk in your next life go take a swan dive off the roof If Im lucky Kachan. If Im lucky. I gripped the straps of my backpack tight. All my dreams my notebooks are all here with me. They can die with me. With one breath I stepped off the edge. Falling. Ive never been afraid of it not even now. Ive fallen down so many times in my life im familiar with me. Someone screamed. Guess Ive been spotted. No heroes nearby doubt anyone down there has a quirk that can save me. Good. Im not worth it. In my next life maybe my dreams can fit into this reality. Soft my bed feels pretty soft. My bed wait I took a deep breath jumping out from under the sheets. I felt my arms stomach back head Im alive How was it all a dream No wait Im still in my school uniform My backpack What the I asked aloud finally seeing where I was. It wasnt my room and it wasnt a hospital room. Did someone down there have a teleportation quirk I asked myself. This room was empty just a bed a bedside table and a picture one the wall near the door. I stood up looking at it. It was of a woman. She was beautiful. Pregnant wearing a dress that looked like it was made out of giant leaves. Okay think Izuku where am I Oh theres a window here. I looked outside it and WHAAAAT Land Floating Dragons Was that a flying 17th century ship Where the heck am I Three in one day I turned around seeing a lady who must have had a mutation quirk cause she looked just like a lizard sorta. She had orangered scales with yellow eyes and she was wearing a pink and blue nuns outfit. Uh hi. I said with a wave of my hand. Uhh where am I She sighed closing the door behind her. Take a seat. Please. I know that tone of voice all too well. The one of voice that has news that breaks you. What is your name Izuku Midoriya. I said. Right. Izuku Uh. I said a little flustered. Wow I must be someplace else cause normally when meeting someone new we address them by the last name first unless were family of close friends. I said sheepishly Im not in Japan anymore am I Right then. Midoriya this isnt your world. Not even your reality. I felt cold. Whwhat do you mean Those chunks of land that flying 17th century ship that was a real dragon She nodded. You are what we call Displaced or Isekai. Oh like that Genre of manga and anime wait what How She sighed. We dont know why people end up in our reality like you do. And not always are you from the same or even similar worldsrealities. All we do know if you adapt the abilities that we native borns have and that you cant return to where you came from. I cant I was shaking holding my head mom what why did I jump Why did I jump Mom Theres no way at all back Maybe in the future one of you Isekai or The Family our realitys gods can find a way. Until then no. Gods A Family of Gods Other Isekai Abilities Abilities I asked. Mostly I wanted to know but also needed a distraction. If I dont have one Yes. Like all of us here now that you exist here you are ageless respawn where you last slept after dying and can gain and unlock other abilities. Wait Okay back up. I said my panic subsiding into more confusion. And a bit of awe too. Ageless Thats right. While we do age up to our adult bodies we can choose how old we want to look be it old and wise to back to our child bodies or keep our adult bodies. Right but Ageless so does that mean what I think it means Yes you will live for a very long time Medoriya. She said with a nod. How long Thousands. Millions. Centillions of years. WHAT How is that even possible The Mother spoke it and so it is a law of nature. The Mother The all maker of this reality. Oh is that her I asked looking over at that picture again. Yes. Whats her name No one knows we just know her as Mother. Huh. Oh I never got your name. She smiled at me. Carla. Just Carla Just Carla. She said with a nod. My family doesnt believe in last names. Dunno why but its never bothered me. Oh well miss Carla what was that part about Respawning after dying You mean I can die and wake up in my bed alive She nodded again. Yes. Though it does leave the old body where you died unless a monster ate it or it was completely destroyed all youll lose is maybe an hour or two of time. ... Huh Good to know. Well looks like this world really cant let me die... Can we still die though There are ways. Level five dungeon bosses can kill you permanently Void Admins and of course Time Walkers. And just those three So far yes. Cara said. Okay thats a few questions for later you last said something about Unlocking abilities does that mean I can get a quirk Quirk Abilities Yes but all kinds of other abilities that fall into any of the categories for Super Power based Abilities. I felt my heart beat faster This world This reality I can Carla I asked my hope sparking. Does that mean I can become a hero She smiled at me. If you work hard enough you can become the strongest hero in this reality. That was The Mother and her family before and if you want you can earn a place with them. Standing with heroes who protect all. I felt a fire ignite in me one that not a short while ago was snuffed out and with it tears. Tears of pure joy and all the while Carla held me. After I calmed down crying about my situation and its positives and negatives I was told I was going to be set up with this Caretakers Guild. They take care of the younger still in school Izikai. Huh referring to myself like that is weird. Hard to believe its even possible. That was what was going to happen. Um Midoriya Carla spoke up entering the room. Someone is here for you. Me Who Why Uh thats the interesting part. She took a step inside to let someone else in. I was greeted by someone a woman I could tell dressed in an all covering neon blue and black cloak covering her face and the cloak was decorated with images of neon blue hourglasses that seemed to move like they were counting down time. Mydoria this is a Time Walker. Shes here to adopt you. Wait she can do that I asked standing up surprised. You are an orphan arent you She asked. Her voice felt so familiar. It was different though something Ive heard before but altered. Legally you Izikai kids are all orphans and can be adopted. Not many people know that or bother since the Caretakers guild watches over you. Dont I get a say in this And say what I froze a bit I am not sure what to say honestly I mean either way I dont have anywhere to go but still Who are you You sound familiar but also not. ... Theres a reason for that. She said pulling her hood back that face that hair Their face was softer and a bit more rounded their hair was longer and less spiked but those eyes Theyre My name is Katsuki Bakugou. You can call me Katsuki. My jaw was on the ground and my brain stopped functioning why is Kacchan a woman I think hes broken Caral said. Probably. Guess when he comes too Ill have to talk to him about how Reflections work. Oh That makes sense. I said having come back to reality about two hours later. Katsuki brought me to their home already and in that time I was out and once I was up and had my second freak out or was it my third Anyway this reality is made from multiple multiverses merged together into one. So that means there are always more than one of anyone even Izikai which is neat. So Katsuki here is a Reflection of Kacchan from back home. Genetically they are almost always exactly identical with some small differences like Blood type being a thing and larger ones like skin tone or a different Quirk being possible too. So were you born in this reality or are you like me Well technically I was born in this reality just before it merged. What You know we dont age like before right I was born before the realms all merged and during the war I was taken into the Time Walkers and fought in it now that its over I sometimes get orders of someone near me who will fall to madness and take them in. So youre that ol OUCH I yelped as she took hold of my head and squeezed with one hand hard Im sorry wanna finish that sentence Nno Good. She let go of me and I took a deep breath. Ive seen a lot done a lot and these days I adopt Isekai kids like you. Huh I said rubbing my head a bit. So does that mean youre friends with a female version of me She flinched looking down now. I did She died in the war O Oh. Im sorry. Its been really long but we were close and I do miss her a lot. Everything Ive learned about life in my long life is that all we can do in the end is move on find a new purpose. For now thats taking care of you and youre foster siblings. Oh theres others here Yeah. Tomura Shimura is likely in his room the little hermit and Kai Chisaki is probably out in the Hazards Zones fighting something. Oh Huh Um So how do I start Getting stronger I mean Thisreality can help me become a hero but I need an ability or something first right Well thats one way. Most people grab a gun sword or learn some magic and head out into the Hazards zones to battle wild monsters and dungeons. Magic cool Uh how do I learn that Am I gonna learn it in school or Nah we can teach you. Besides Im not sending you to school. What Why Cause in this reality Middle and High School is completely optional and everything everyone ever needs to learn is taught in elementary school. The Caretakers Guild only keeps you kids in school cause youre used to going to school that long for the start of your life. Uh Okay I guess. So do we start today or Well fist I do want you to meet Tomura and Kai so I need to pull that hermit out of his room. Kai should be back in a few hours or so. She said standing up and cracking her knuckles. Alright time to drag the hermit out of his room. You wait here alright. With that Katsuki walked over to the door with Tomuras name on it and kicked it down. Tomura Get out here and meet your new foster brother In the middle of a boss fight one moment I heard someone call out in the room. Did he bring snacks Pause it And you have your own snack cabinet why do you need more Bloodborne has no pausing and you know exactly why Dont make me drag you out again I will throw you through the walls again Fine There was some grumbling noises in the room as the background noise seemed to stop as the door opened. Yes hi. Tomura this is Izuku Midoriya. Hes Isekai like you for now call him Midoriya since hes used to that. Tomura was fairly tall taller than me and really thin dull greywhite hair wearing a long sleeve blue shirt and grey sweatpants. Nice to meet you. I said standing up and offering a hand. He shook it and it was then I realized he was wearing a thin set of leather gloves. Nice to meet you. Tomura said simply. And dont mind the gloves its to keep my quirk in check. Oh you have a quirk What is it If thats okay with you I mean. I said sheepishly. If he needs gloves to keep it in check then odds are its probably either hard to control or dangerous. Decay. Tomura told me simply as he pulled off one of his gloves and softly tapped a part of the wall...where he touched it instantly fell apart to dust. Very powerful...but I cant control it which sucks. Woah So does the amount of time you spend touching something vary into how much of it decays Does it take all five fingers or just one Does it affect you at all I began asking. As long as I make physical contact with my hands it doesnt matter. He started. It does depend on how long I touch...dont ask how I learned it Im still sore He gave Katsuki a quick little glare. And lastly...a little. He said while using the ungloved hand to softly peel away skin from his cheek. Thats why I lookchapped as it were. Now if only he used all that lotion for his whole body. Katsuki said making Tomura turn a dark shade of red. Myself too. We dont talk about that. He grumbled. So which version are you from Uh version I asked. What was different about your world than others He corrected himself. I dont know really. Well All Might is the number one Hero and uh only about ten percent of the population doesnt have a quirk I cant tell whats different from your version of my world and my world. If there are any differences. Theyre not always big differences kid. Katsuki said. Most of the times Reflections have small differences. Like you took a left over going right you ate sushi over pork one night. Stupid things like that. Most of the time Reflections are basically completely identical save for those small things. Youre thinking of the big noticeable stuff I imagine. Fact is unless we saw your world we wouldnt know of any differences. And given no Isekai has even found a means to get back to their home reflection we probably wont know. Tomura just shrugged. Hey at least you know what your world was in some ways...I barely even remember my birth mothers face You dont remember them I asked surprised. No. Tomura was four when he ended up here. Kai was two. Katsuki said sadly. The Isekai that arrive here come in all ages. Babies children teens adults young and old. Not like it mattered...from what I was told I was about to be abandoned on the streets somewhere back on my world. Tomura said bitterly putting back on his leather glove. Wait how Why Trends. Katsuki said. Other reflections of Tomura their stories and actions. Its not pretty. In any case Tomura I need you and Kai when he gets back to help Midoriya learn to fight. I want to make sure hes worthy of the quirk Ill be giving him. And which one will that be Tomura inquired. Any of the other trending quirks for him Im giving him her quirk. If he can prove himself. She stated. Tomuras eyes widened a bit but nodded. You three will start tomorrow. For now take Midoriya shopping. Hell need to decorate his room and have the proper gear. And Ill give him the talk about people being heroes without quirks Tomura asked. If you want but either way he will gain abilities over time. Katsuki shrugged. So Where are we gonna go I asked Tomura. To the mall. He said while going back into his room and grabbing a bookbag. Here youre gonna need this since you dont have an Assistant yet. Actually thanks for reminding me Tomura. Katsuki said taking out a thin slip of paper with some weird design inside a circle on it. Right or left arm Uh right I said lifting my right arm to her. She placed the sleeve of paper on my wrist and I watched in awe as it melted into my skin leaving only the image from the paper behind and WOAH New User Registered Izuku Midoriya Age 14 Race Human Generating Set up. Set up Generated. I blinked surprised at how my vision changed. There was now a map in the bottom left of my vision with a compass arrow around it. In the bottom right was an image of my face with the number 120 under it in bold red font. What is all this Youre hud. Think Video Games and it all makes sense. You got your HP Map with compass and when you agree to be in a party with people you can see their HP too. Katsuki said. Woah This is amazing And so useful Yeah its really handy when you learn how it fully works. Tomura shrugged. It also works like a video game storage bag without much limits. How is this even possible I asked looking at the symbol on my wrist. Mixture of magic and science. Members of the Family made it a long time ago all in all its just a part of life here. Katsuki said. Alright you two get going. And try and be back before it gets dark. Yes mother. Tomura nodded. Come on best you get surprised about the mall sooner rather than later. Ive been to a mall before. I said Tomura and Katsuki began chuckling. HOLY COW This mall was massive on the outside but inside I swear its going further and higher than the outside should have held How Told ya. Tomura chuckled at my reaction. And its simple dimensional magic really. So how big is this mall I asked. Yes. That what Its big lets leave it at that. Tomura shook his head. I stopped counting after...maybe the trillionth or so shop opened up How do they all stay open Is this city really that big Amberdovin He said while thinking a bit. Well...its hard to explain how many people both live here and travel here. Is it a major city Actually When I woke up at that Church Carla told me this reality was infinit. Are the worlds the same I know Katsuki told me a few things but all in all Im still not sure just how big the worlds are cause when I was at the church I only saw mostly the wild and no real cities nearby. There are different worlds and theyre all about half as big as the Homeworld. Tomura said honestly. And Homeworld as far as historians have figured out and Time Walkers are willing to tell is that its every world from the multiverse put together that started this new realm. Every world in thats a massive planet. Is this homeworld No this is Dechamore. He answered. Oh and how big is Dechamore compared to Homeworld Half as big as it. Tomura replied simply. No idea how big half of home world is but its pretty big. How That much gravity should just wed all be dead either from the gravity or pulled into a singularity. Mother said so. Tomura shrugged. And before you ask Mother does exist and they can easily rewrite reality on a whim just like other Admins. Right Katsuki told me a bit about that. What makes her different from Admins Okay so effectively...shes capital G God while Admins are lower case g Gods if that makes sense. Tomura said simply. I guess. So where do we go first then I asked looking around at all the shops. I dont even know what half these shops are and I think all that shop sells is pens Yeah at certain points shops start selling personalized items. Tomura answered. But were going shopping to decorate your room Tomura stopped for a moment and looked at me. Whats the last thing you remember Huh Why do you ask Cause itll depend on what you get and if I need to tell you All Might is wrong. Tomura told me. Wait what I asked feeling scared now. How did you My other Reflections He told them the same thing didnt he I shook a bit looking down. He told me I cant become a hero then left after he was gone I walked to the edge of the building and jumped. I dont know how far I fell all I know is that next thing I knew I woke up in the Church. Ah. Tomura nodded. That makes sense. Thats the major difference between our worlds. Tomura said honestly. Well...here follow me. Tomura said as he started leading me to a specific shop. So how most people know at least general things about worlds before hand is merchandise. He said while showing me a shop titled MHA and inside...wait is that a statue of me Things that could have happened if you grabbed onto All Might or found All for One you would have either become the Greatest Hero or the Greatest Villain...but here in this realm you dont need a quirk to be a hero. He said honestly. And also thats you with All Mights quirk. He pointed to the statue of me that showed me as the number one hero. has stopped working. I shook my head after a minute. So were all anime characters Yes and no. He said honestly. Yes in the sense that our worlds have been documented as anime but no because we are living breathing people. He explained. Uh...do you know about multiverse theory Yes thats basically this reality still its a bit concerning to see my face on merchandise. You get used to it. Tomura shrugged. So why do I bring this up Its because now youre not constrained to our old worlds rules and you dont need a quirk to be a hero...and you can still look up to All Might about being a true hero even if he hated telling you the sad truth. Tomura told me. Cause...honestly its sometimes hard to find good role models when starting out like this to be honest. Huh this is all so weird and I blinked seeing a door with long strings acting as a door and above it was a sigh reading adult. Uhhhh Dont. He said as he stepped in front of me. I went in there once...learned maybe a little too much He said nervously. I guessed so knowing thats a thing should I be concerned about certain people That depends on certain people. He said honestly. Fans of us Yes. The people were shipped with Well He pointed to a piece of what I could tell was a fanart of me and a...very cute brown haired girl I never met looking like were on a date. The person were shipped with...well you can at least give it a go. II Dont even know that girl You might someday. Tomora shrugged. Who knows but I show you this today to show you what could have been and what could still be to be honest. Huh this is interesting. I have a lot to think about. Tomura and I did our shopping. I kept to basic things clothes bed desk. When we ended up having to get weapons though. Who thought it was a good idea to make a bullet thats also a nuke I asked taking a few steps back from said bullets. Several people thats why theres several brands of guns that specially order those kinds of bullets. Tomora said simply. If things wont die to a bullet and there are hundreds of things that do then why not nuke it Are there seriously things out there that take a nuke to kill it And there are things that take several of them just to get past its defense but you wont be seeing those until maybe...dungeon level three bosses Tomura guessed with some thought. Its been a while since I last went to one. Youve been to Dungeons What are they like Ever played a dungeon crawler before Uh no. Ive actually rarely played video games. Im sorry. Tomura told me like the fact me barely playing video games was a bad thing. Uh...so basically dungeons are several floors full of monsters ranging from simple enough at level one to extremely difficult for admins at level five. Okay. And I was told about a Heroes Guild. How does that work if the monsters are in dungeons The Heroes Guild is to make sure monsters stay within their respective areas and under proper numbers if need be as well as stopping the Sub Human or Villians Guild. Tomura said honestly. I figured there would be a Villains Guild but what is the sub humans guild The Subhumans is one of the few villains guilds like I just told you. Tomura pointed out. They are the bad guys that are needed to keep things running smoothly. Keep wait how Arent bad guys and villains bad for society Why would they be needed Without the villain guilds heroes will get complacent treat it more like a job to get paid like most of the heroes back home. He stated. And when that happens its up to the guilds to keep them on their toes and actively doing the work theyre supposed to...cause Mother only knows when someones going to try and break the system for real. Oh so its better to have villains who are bad as a job to keep others doing their jobs. Are there actual bad guys though Like back home People that are a part of the guilds but also malicious outside of their work Shigaraki asked. Well...there is a guild for those assholes but theres...only a few million members The truly malicious people are so few and far between and they are nothing like back home. He shook his head. The only one that was truly malicious back home was All for One to be honest. Huh. So what weapons should I use I dont exactly have any combat training or even know how to use weapons. I said looking over a large set of knives daggers and is that a gauntlet with a shotgun on it Well it all depends on what you want to learn considering youre going to be getting a quirk soon. Shigaraki told me. But...I suppose we should focus less on what should you use and more what chooses you. He said simply. Are these weapons sentient Those would be Keyblades and were not looking for those right now. He said honestly. But some weapons can choose their wielder so if we go to the right weapon shop either you find it or it finds you. Tomura shrugged. Or neither could happen cause sometimes a knife is just a knife not something else. Thats kinda anti climactic. It happens. Tomura shrugged. But dont worry about not knowing how to use something right now cause you can easily learn how to wield practically anything from either the many heroes guilds or the internet. Fair enough so maybe one of each How much did Katsuki give us Enough. He said simply while looking over our money. So I ended up getting about one of each weapon the shop had available. There was a lot of stuff here I dont think even counted as a weapon. I mean what even is a Pokeball With all this in my Assistant which is cool. Dont ever need a backpack. So how old are people allowed to own weapons Back home Guns were only given to police and military but I saw some kids younger than us with them. With supervision a ten year old can hold a weapon at fourteen you can hold a weapon but need supervision for any dungeons. He said honestly. And the Hazard zones Katsuki said Kai was out there what are they exactly Thats where dungeons and monsters spawn. He said honestly. Depending on what level the dungeon is it could be simple or dangerous. Ah. Does Kai go out there often He stays safe while fighting monsters...thats all that matters. Tomura told me simply. So thats a yes then. Do you use weapons when youre right or do you mostly use your Quirk Depends on the situation. Tomura shrugged. Not many things are immune to decay. Does it heal undead enemies If it can harm most normal enemies do the undead get healed by it This isnt Dungeons and Dragons where they get healed by negative energy. Tomura rolled his eyes. I just speed up their decay till they turn to dust. Oh. Dungeons and Dragons I think Ive heard of that. An old board game back home. They stopped making it like fifty years before I was born I think Thats sad. He shook his head. But it kept going here so theres that. So is Katsuki always like that with you When Im too busy playing video games. He shrugged. Is that often then She said something about throwing you through the wall again Not as often as youd think. He said. Only like...three times Heh. Guess shes more like Kacchan than I first thought. Does she have the same Explosion Quirk If theres one thing consistent with all the Bakugos in existence its that they are hot headed but caring and they are walking and talking explosions. Shes at least calmer than Kacchan. And seems to believe I can do something other than be useless. I said looking down. She said she was in the war and taken into the Time Walkers shortly after. How strong is she I figure the Time Walkers must be pretty strong but just how strong Not many know how strong Time Walkers are all I know is that she can handle really powerful individuals. He said honestly. And What are the Time Walkers. Their name indicates time is involved and she said something about getting jobs about people risking Madness from time to time. Do they actually time travel or do they just look ahead to prevent bad stuff Theyre effectively the Time Police going backwards and forwards in time to make sure events happen properly deal with any weird things...or kill those that fall to Madness. But I was told we respawn after dying are you telling me Time Walkers can kill you permanently Madness is something that transcends respawns...so yes its a permanent death. He said bitterly. It can happen to anyone who lives long enough or experiences too much. So theres no cure or means of reversing it And how come some people like Katsuki dont get it but some others do Is there any known connections between them other than living so long Its...complicated. He said honestly. I dont know all the details but it just happens to people Time Walkers being one of the few that are immune to Madness because of their work. Hmm so basically its just like a normal death. Never know when it will come. Are there other things that can perma kill us Level Five Dungeons and Void Admins. He said honestly. Alright and level five dungeons are the strongest types right Yep the strongest type of dungeons and are extremely dangerous even if no monsters around. Yikes. Aside from dungeons are there other ways of getting stronger Training monster hunting simple stuff like that. He shrugged. Going to Hazard zones or going to the numerous arenas around. Ah. Alright then and Abilities how do those work exactly Well they range in usage and power but basically they can do simple things like make you stronger faster more HP or MP give you superpowers a lot like quirks but they arent. Actually theres a sub category for abilities called Quirk Abilities. Most you just go through the skill tree system to unlock and gain stronger ones over time with Skill Points earned in dungeons or arenas or guild missions and quests. There are some you can buy and others you can get completely at random. I myself have the Ability Scan a basic first timer ability everyone gets and Filtration 1. Basically I can safely breath and consume low quality poisons and poison gases. Woah. So they arent too different from quirks but you can just get them how and as you want. Thats really cool. It is from an outsiders point of view to people whove been here for a while it feels natural enough. Heh fair enough. So whats Kai like Smart kid wants to be a hero instead of what he could have been like. He said simply. Pretty hyper a Monster Hunter and a practicing taxidermist. He can do taxidermy Yeah. Puts then in his trophy room. Huh Whats his Quirk Or does he not have one He has one his quirk is named Overhaul. He said simply. Hes able to deconstruct and reconstruct anything he can touch and all his fighting has given him such a degree hes able to and I shit you not touch a monster and makes its top half explode. Holy he probably doesnt do that much if he is gonna taxidermy it though. Unless he can reconstruct the body too can he Yes he can. He said nervously. Its...sometimes scary to see what he can do sometimes...though his favorite thing is to literally make a giant suit of armor out of whatever material is around him and punch things. I can see how thats scary though also extremely useful. So what about Magic how does that work That I dont know given that magic can work in so many wildly different ways that its best just to think magic works cause magic. Tomura shrugged. Not to mention all the schools of magic and its just a headache half the time. Oh. So when learning to use magic your preferred method is up for you to pick. Interesting. Do you know any magic Only a few spells. He said while raising his hand and a small amount of fire in his hand. Woah. Does it hurt holding the fire like that Nope. He said honestly. Things you create with magic cant hurt you if you know how to control it properly. Cool. We made it back and Tomura helped me set up my room and everything. I was surprised at how much we got. I still wonder how much Katsuki gave us for shopping. I know the money here isnt the same as back home. They call it Rem but still felt like a lot of this stuff was pretty cheap save for weapons. Those prices felt about accurate. With everything set up for me here Tomura stuck around playing something he called a Switch some weird small gaming console. So how many games do you have I asked. Tomura was sitting on my bed while I was at the desk looking over my hero notebook. This was in my backpack and so far aside from myself and clothes my backpack was also on me when I arrived here. Great its still wet. Yes. He said simply. And theres a way to fix that. You do know just saying yes isnt an answer. I sighed. And fix my notebook you mean But its appropriate because I lost count. He said simply. And yes it is easy enough to fix your notebook. How Magic or what Well either that or a Restorater. He said simply. Its a machine that can restore objects to their original state remember how I decayed some of the wall around my room and it looked brand new Oh yeah. Do you have one Yes I do. He said while going through his assistant and bringing the Restorator out. It looked a lot simpler looking like a phone with a two pronged antena. This is a handheld one able to fix any small items some medium items and able to patch up large things like walls and stuff like that. I took it. So I just hold it over the boom and press this button I did just that and watched as a red line of light moved over the notebook and I watched in awe as it began repairing like new from top to bottom. Woah. I said the machine was done and I handed it back to Tomura. I then flipped through the pages. Its like new and everything is still here. The wonders of technology. Tomura nodded as the device disappeared into his assistant. I guess I look kinda weird huh I mean you pretty much grew up with this stuff and here I am looking at everything and asking questions like a toddler. It happens. He shrugged. No matter who you talk to when you first get to this world theres always gonna be questions...and theres still more questions than answers about a lot of things in this world. Fair enough. So Katsuki only kept you two in school till Elementary was done What did you two do after Whatever we wanted honestly. Tomura shrugged. I mostly just delved into the gamer world while Kai went to be more of the monster hunter. You two never got jobs Kai has his monster hunting which gives plenty of money and my gaming helps give me money as well through donations. Believe it or not talking to people and playing video games can get you quite a bit if you are a good person. Huh. Thats pretty cool. So last question Do you know how we end up here Like a specific reason or is it just random No idea. He shrugged. Its hotly debated on why especially for people like us...but its better than what would have happened before we got here. Huh With that I flipped through the pages of my notebook and also began looking through some books I picked up today. Spells and Potions for Beginners Guns and Ammo for Rookies Swordsmanship 101 Knockout Punches Unarmed Based Combat and lastly Abilities and You. I flipped to a blank page in my notebook and opened up Guns and Ammo for Rookies. Firearms probably wont be my specialty but until I build up my body more they will due. Quickie thing remember to prepare yourself before you do things. No need for your first few days of training to break every bone in your arms. Tomura started as he played something on his Switch. That sounds painful. I imagine if I do get injured like that though it can be healed like it never happened He nodded. Thats what I expected. So how was your first time in combat Did it go well or did you get hurt really bad It was...a little rough He said nervously. Especially when...well I accidentally fought a sentient being and hit them with my bare hands...the shriek wasnt really a good thing to hear Oh We respawn though so they were okay after right Yes but what I did was still nervous when I was fourteen. He said honestly. And my first dungeon adventure. Oh So I take it you dont use your Quirk in dungeons often I only use it when I have to. He said simply. Cause...when you literally feel the creature you are holding fall apart in your hands no matter how tough they are...its not something Ive learned to see using more unlike how trends normally see me. Oh So how do you fight when you dont use your Quirk Swords Guns Tomura pulled out a sword and a pistol. Both actually. He said honestly. Best to have options for close and ranged combat. Fair enough. I imagine Kai largely relies on his Quirk in combat. I said looking through the guns book. Wait guns and ammo can spawn from killed monsters and in dungeons I asked. Then whats the point of selling them in shops Preparation and Capitalism. He told me simply. Mostly the preparation part considering you might have weapons and ammo from a dungeon that doesnt mean youll have what you need for different dungeons. Fair enough I guess. So what kind of things aside from weapons and ammo can you find in dungeons Well it can range from a lot of things. He said. All depends on the dungeon and what level it is. Cause it can range from weapons materials food people I was rather quick to cut him off there. Wait what People Dont worry its not like slavery or anything. He said as he raised a hand. Its one of the rewards for beating the main dungeon boss and you can either get an adventure partner a butler or lover. He said honestly. Wait what Lover How does that work I dont know the details of it since I havent either looked it up or got one but from what Ive heard is that...well its basically the age old save the royal from the dragon kind of thing kill the boss get your prince or princess because of it as they imprint onto you and learn about you on a general level. Huh And you can get multiple. I jumped seeing Katsuki at the door grinning. Dont be surprised if you suddenly have a harem now. Tomura rolled his eyes and I turned a deep shade of red. And yes thats legal here. Sos casual sex but Im leaving that talk for you with Kai. Speaking of why isnt he back yet Hes usually not out this late Either he got laid or he found a really cool monster he wants to turn into a trophy. Or both. Tomura sighed. Okay So that aside where will I be starting off tomorrow Am I gonna get put into a dungeon right away or Thats really up to Katsuki there. He shrugged. Nope you and Kai are on that job kid. Gets you out of the house more than once a month so its good with me She declared laughing as Tomura sighed. Cause of course He grumbled and rubbed his temples. Hey I love you but you need a life. And some sun. And odds are while you are out there youll get a girlfriend boyfriend casual rutt buddy I dont care just someone other than your browser history. I told you not to look at that woman He snapped his face turning a bright shade of red in embarrassment. Firstly not deleting it was your fault second you act like that shit is kinky. Its vanilla at best boy. Im just gonna keep reading They went back and forth like that for a while until Mom Tomura I just got the fucking Naga Rabbit I turned seeing a man with brown hair golden eyes and wearing a winter coat with jeans and sneakers holding what looked like the product of a rabbit and a snake interbreeding. It was twitching. This little shit tried to eat my hand. The hell did you do to it Kai Tomura asked. So this is Kai huh. Well it tried to swallow my hand so I used my quirk and popped a few blood veins in its head. So its having an aneurysm I should really put this thing out of its misery. He then snapped its neck really casually. Also when did we get a new room Katsuki sighed. Kai this is your new Foster Brothers room. Izuku Midoriya. Midoriya this is Kai. Uh hi I said with a wave. I heard about you from Tomura Hes like us. Tomura said simply. Oh wow you are way older than Tomura or I were when we got here. Whats your world like is it the same as ours Do you have a quirk too What Katsuki covered Kays mouth. Down boy. He just got here today so he has a lot to process still. You and Tomura are gonna take him out tomorrow to train and get stronger so he can prove himself worthy of my late friends quirk. So keep the questions down alright And take that to your room and stuff it or burn it you know I hate seeing dead things in the house. Kai nodded and rapidly ran to his room. So thats Kai hes rather hyper. I said still processing all that. Still better than who he could have been. Tomura said honestly. And Kai gets out more and is excited to meet new people. So good to know then. Should I be worried Nah. Katsuki said. Kais hyper and kinda reckless but he is smarter than he lets on and never gets into a fight he knows he cant handle. Frankly I want you two with him to make sure he stays that way plus as a team you all can get stronger together than you three could alone. True. Tomura nodded. Having a team is always better than doing things alone thats for sure. It would also make dealing with strong enemies easier. I said thoughtfully. Perfect Dinner will be ready in two hours if you wanna get some kind of practice in the training room in the next door down on the right. With that Katsuki left. You guys have a training room I asked. Why wouldnt we Isnt this an apartment though it cant this is built like the mall isnt it To a lesser degree. He admitted. It more so fits with whats needed for the family like extra rooms certain rooms being bigger all that stuff. Oh neat Guess if Im gonna be training then I best practice. I sighed standing up. Lead the way. Alright. Tomura nodded while leading me to the training room. It looked like a blank white room then he tapped a screen on the wall and suddenly it looked like a shooting range Id see from some army movie. Woah. Yeah the training room is a special thing where you can have it look like anything you want sort of like the holodeck from Star Trek. Whats Star Trek Its an old scifi show. He answered. Like twenty first century old considering our world was in the twenty second or third century. Huh. Okay so how does this work exactly I asked taking out a pistol. Tomura showed me how it fires the safety and how to reload the magazine. Apparently there are apps on the Assistant that help to do things like reload your gun and special magazines that pull the ammo from your inventory without ever needing to reload your gun. Now I was just shooting and aiming which I was bad at. I figured Id be bad at this but I havent even hit the target yet. I grumbled. Take a deep breath. He told me. And relax a little youre not gonna get it right your first try. Here watch me. Tomura said pulling out his pistol and taking aim as he got into what I could tell a proper position to fire a gun. He shot off three hits two hitting the torso of the target and one hitting the head where the nose would be. It still doesnt feel right. I said looking the weapon over. Maybe I can try something that doesnt require accuracy Everything needs accuracy if youre not using explosive weapons. Tomura said simply. But what do you have in mind I dunno I sighed. He needs to train his body first Tomura. I looked up seeing Kai there now. He didnt have his coat on anymore. Build some muscles and all that first. Kai then went over to the wall screen and the room changed from a shooting range to a public gym. We can start off by first learning how much you can lift how hard you can hit how fast you are basic physical stuff really. Well he didnt have a tough time with his guns recoil so thats a start. Tomura shrugged. Its a .32 Tomura a four year old can handle it. Kai said. Alright first lets test strength. So Kai put me through a bit of a ringer pushing me til I couldnt go anymore and taking notes on how well or bad I did. Well the good news is you arent super weak. The bad news is you are still below Tomura and hes still pretty much a shrimp. I can still kick your ass. Tomura frowned. Regardless this gives us a means of knowing where you are and what to improve. But arent we going out into a field or something tomorrow I asked. I can squeeze something to work in with it. In the meantime if you wanna throw a punch or swing a sword properly best start lifting. So thats mostly what I did. Lifted with Kai spotting me and Tomura just playing his games watching til dinner. I could barely lift my arms while eating and once dinner was done Kai kept having me lift til almost midnight. I slept clear through the night and woke up feeling beat still. Once breakfast was done I headed out with Tomura and Kai to these Hazard Zones and apparently Kai owned a car. And inside said car was his own massive mansion. Are you serious The cars too I asked Kai putting the thing in auto pilot and just sitting down reading a book. Well gotta stay comfy somehow. Tomura shrugged as he checked his gear. With technology like this why bother making the worlds so big I asked. Possibilities. Kai said still looking through their book. The whole point of this reality set up is to deliver unlimited possibilities. Keeps people happy and keeps madness away. Really Yeah. Not much is known about Triggers madness but they believe it might be related to extreme sadness boredom and all kinds of negative emotions. The stronger they get the more likely they believe Madness to trigger. As it is Madness is almost like a berserker state. So imagine how bad it can get when a really powerful person falls to it. The time walkers like Mom get informed of the person and date and typically show up a month or two before so the person can get their affairs in order before getting taken in. And if they run Bad things happen. Tomura said simply. In the end you cant escape Madness. Most people accept the reality after time to process and settle things before leaving with the time walkers. From there people dont actually know what happens but its assumed they are perma killed. Oh Doesnt sound like that good of a job or life. I said. But its needed. Maybe one day Mother will be able to correct Madness make it go away. We can only hope. But in the meantime time for some monster hunting. After an hour we arrived and woah We were in a massive hilly valley filled with trees and floating hills linked to the earth by roots or vines and woah. Welcome to the Hazard Zones The Gydamino Hills. Kai stated. Its a simple area for first timers. Tomura said honestly. And with the both of us here...unless a Blood Moon happens youll be fine. Bblood moon I asked. Yeah. Theres two varieties for event nights. Blood Moons and Blue Moons. Blood Moons spawn monsters in higher quantity and buffs them way stronger. They also drop much higher quality items and money as well. Blue Moons are basically the opposite. Enemies are nerfed pretty well and spawn less if at all and they still drop a lot of good stuff. The trick is finding enemies. They spawn so less and actually run rather than fight so they are pretty hard to get to. Overall its pretty simple. Tomura shrugged. So what kind of monsters are around here This area specifically some Shadow Creature variants a few zombies and I think a giant or two Cant remember. Easy. Tomura said simply. I dont even know what a Shadow Creature is and Zombies and Giants How am I supposed to fight those Its best if its shown rather than explained. Tomura said honestly. Especially Shadow Creatures those are...a bit weird to explain. Well come on then Midoriya. Kai said leading the way. We were hiking a few miles until we saw one. It looked like a person but small plants and vines were growing out of its body. Theres a zombie. Basic one too slow dumb easy to kill. Does it work like in the movies I asked. Thats the quick way so if you can a shot or two to the head works fine and fast. Decapitation works too or just bask the head til its jelly so you got options. So have at it. Tomura told me. Just dont get bit if you try to stab it. Or I become a zombie Well if left untreated. Kai said. You gain an undead race class and to get back to being human can be a pain and buying a new profile slot to stay human and swap between. Wait what Theres this feature called Profile Slots. Basically you buy them for about a million rem each and in each slot you can have a form for each of the different races. And before you ask no Tomura and I dont have any. Theyre expensive as hell and getting a new race form is often hell in its own right. Oh yeah. Tomura shook his head. Its a lot more hassle than one would think and while the upsides are good...its not really worth the effort. Well some race types are harder to get than others but yeah some people make it a goal to grab them all. An expensive hobby if you ask me but hey their life. Kai shrugged. Are there benefits to being an undead I asked. Now Im curious about all this I even had my notebook out. A few immunities to most forms of poisons and parasites cant get tired dont feel pain and the usual fair for zombies if they actually used their brain. He shrugged. The negatives is everything that an undead would normally have like holy damage decapitation depending on the area youre own body might just crap out on you due to the weather because everything that would help you be alive is turned off. But upgrading your race helps negate most of those negatives. Kai added. You can upgrade your race Does that include Humans too Oh yeah. Every race can be upgraded and the final upgrade of every race is called the Godhood race. Godhood race They were created by Asmith the Admin of Genetics. Tomura said. Its basically the pinnacle of each race strong enough to rival some Admins but extremely difficult to get to. Yeah. Upgrading your race and therefore body into a Godhood takes a fuck ton of time and skill points. The last guy I heard who managed to unlock his Godhood race it took him twenty five sextillion years and almost triple that in Skill Points. Kai said. Holy crap I said realizing I swore but shook it off. If it takes that much time and effort is it even worth it Depends on the person. Kai shrugged. It definitely looks worth it the things they can do and without even being an admin its insane. On paper it looks like the biggest waste of time this side of known existence but in practice its been said to be extremely worth the trouble able to take on level four dungeons solo without much of a scratch and if you manage to get a group of them together some level five dungeons just fall over if rumors are to be believed. Woah I said writing all these notes down. Alright enough note taking head on over and kill it. Kai said. If you wanna be a hero then this is your first step cause before you can fight against the villain guilds you have to be able to handle yourself against mindless monsters Tomura put your phone away and stop playing Pokemon Go There was a Gible here damn it Tomura countered. Kai facepalmed. Okay just why You can catch a real Gible why are you trying to catch a digital one While Kai and Tomura kept arguing I got up and over to the undead. It looked so grotesque. I sighed taking out the handgun and lifted it. Being this close I cant miss. I took a deep breath and pulled the trigger. Pop crack and it fell to the ground. Loot 1 pocket watch 1 .32 bullet case 10 rem. Huh. Not much loot but I guess that makes sense. I looked at the handgun this still feels wrong I put the handgun away and pulled out my magic book. Lets see here huh Telekinesis. A basic beginners spell most commonly used to lift and move heavy objects this spell has many vast applications in combat as well. Its like Moms quirk but stronger. There was a diagram some matrix I needed to keep mentally as to cast the spell. Hmm this is actually pretty simple and if I cant keep it memorized I can draw it on paper or clothes or something so I can keep casting. Hmm I took out my pen copying the matrix onto the back of my hand. Lets put a pin in that what are you doing there Midoriya Tomura asked curiously. Using a gun just doesnt feel right or sit well with me. I saw when flipping through my magic book just now these spell Matrixes when drawn on clothing or paper can let you use the spell without memorizing it mentally. I wanna give it a try. It reminds me of Moms quirk. I said looking the matrix over. A perfect copy from the book. Well drink this first. Kai said handing me a bottle with a blue liquid inside. Its a Mana potion. Cant cast spells without drinking one of those or absorbing a Mana gem. I nodded drinking the potion and once it was all down tasted like flat lime soda a new bar percentage appeared under my HP. MP 50. I looked around seeing a rock on the ground. Now how did mom used to use her quirk How does my quirk work Well sweetie its a lot like imagining I have lots of arms. When I want to float something over to me I imagine grabbing it with one of the extra arms and bringing it over. Even heavy fast stuff Well sorta. I can mostly just lift up what I can physically carry and even then I can still feel the weight of all the objects Im lifting even when Im not physically holding them. Imagine arms reaching out and grabbing them. Mentally I invisioned a pair of arms stretching out over from me and grabbing each side of the rock. Lifting it up. The rock was floating there I watched as my MP was draining. From 50 to 49.9. guess this spell doesnt take all that much MP to use. It went down another percent of a point every few seconds. Now I imagined throwing the rock and watched as it was thrown hard into a nearby tree. The bark was toughed up a little as it hit and bounced off to the floor. Huh throwing it made the MP drop to 47.8. Thats really impressive for your first time using a Telekinesis spell. Kai said. I just remembered how mom always told me using her quirk was like and applied it. I said looking at my hand and the drawn matrix on it. Oh yeah your mother did have a levitation quirk. Tomura said. So how does it feel using it like that Honestly better. Theres just something about guns I wasnt liking. Maybe magic is just more your thing Kai said with a shrug. If thats the case Mana gems are gonna be a top priority for you to get as well as potions if I remember right Tomura when he binged watched the show thats based on our home worlds your dad could breathe fire right Yeah. I said with a nod. Then flip to some Pyromancy spells maybe since your mom was a telekinetic you are more attuned to telekinesis which is why it came so easily to you. Same should go with Pyromancy given your Dads quirk. I nodded flipping through the book. Now where is Pyromancy spells...Lets see if youre gonna be better with Fire than Todoroki. Tomura brought up. Who I asked finding the spell matrix and began copying it into the palm of my hand this time. Once that was done I remembered what dad told me his quirk was like. My quirk Well my boy when using my quirk I have to feel some emotions. Emotions Yes. When Im angry or mad or anything like that the fire I make burns hotter and more wild. But when Im happy calm or even just bored its not as hot is more controlled and burns only what and where I want it to. Lots of other fire based Quirk users can tell you the same cause our emotions fuel the fires into sparking before they even touch something flammable. Emotions fueling the fire to spark into existence positive emotions produce more controlled calm fires negative emotions produce stronger wildfires. I remembered what Karla told me when I got here. I can become a hero. I felt a heat in my hand and saw a small flame burning just above my palm. Now then I thought of this fire like a ball and threw it. The flame was thrown just like a baseball hitting a small bush that it set ablaze and died once the bush was nothing but burnt twigs and ashes. Damn. You are a natural at both. No wonder mom is trying to make sure you are worthy of Pyrokinesis. Kai said with a smile. Pyrokinesis I asked. Is that her friend that female reflection of me was that her quirk Endeavors quirk but none of the downsides. Tomura said simply. Basically its a perfect combination of your mom and dads quirks. She was able to create and control fire. Shed spark the fire from her mouth and then mentally control it like part of her body. Just by spitting into a fire she was able to control that one too. It was really impressive. Kai said. Theres a lot of old videos online you can look up to see for yourself. Ever heard of The Last Airbender Tomura asked. Cause if you have then it works a lot like the fire bending in that. No and Ill be sure to look up those videos. A perfect combination quirk she was lucky she and Katsuki got along great much better than Kacchan and I ever did. I wonder if he even noticed Im gone or cares This definitely feels better. So I should be on the look out for Mana gems I asked. Yeah we should actually hunt those down to give you a good pool of self recharging Mana. I think theres a dungeon nearby that spawns them Kai said checking his maps through his Assistant. Man these things are useful. And none of the enemies just naturally drop them I think an elemental or two spawns in the area. Tomura brought up. Not many and its only a twenty percent chance. At least in the dungeon its guaranteed we get more than one. Drop rates...even in real life they taunt me Tomura grumbled. So what is this dungeon I asked. The Root Mine. Kai said an image like a hologram displayed out in the air from his Assistant. It looked like a giant tree that was cut at the base and roots uplifted andany holes both in the roots and around them littered the ground. Place is a raw ore and gem gold mine. Enemies always drop at least one or the other and the ores and gems spawn in the walls and roots all the time. The enemies arent all that strong either in fact the greatest threat are other explorers. Not everyone likes to play nice when in the dungeons. And this is why I mostly play by myself. Tomura crossed his arms. Well be fine. Four can easily top Midoriya off for an easy two hundred MP and set his recharge rate pretty fast. Come on Kai said holding out his arm showing the Assistant. Tomura sighed and tapped his Assistant to Kais. You two Midoriya this is how we register as members of the same Party. Youll be able to see our hp and mp in your hub as well as where we are on your map. I nodded doing as Tomura did and I saw smaller head images of Kai and Tomura with their HP and MP displayed in my top left. See our health now Tomura asked me. Yeah holy cow. I was speechless. Tomura 2700 HP. 950 MP. Kai 3500 HP. 750 MP. Woah. You guys have really high HP and MP. Its not really that high. Tomura shrugged. Early on it might be but its nowhere near how high it can really go. How high does it go No one knows. Kai shrugged. So far nobody has actually reached a cap or limit. And considering how old people here can live thats saying something. Even so without a good defense even a large HP pool can drop to zero fast. And then theres those annoying bastards that have both stupidly high hp and a stupidly high defense. Tomura grumbled. Thats...how I learned not to entirely like my quirk You forget they deserve it. Kai said. Plus the last time they saw you they ran away so they learned their lesson. Yes they did. Tomura nodded. Alright how big is it I asked. Its pretty big. Its a mixed dungeon. Theres usually about four types of dungeons. Tower Arena Field and Mixed. Tower dungeons go either deep below the ground high above or both. Arena are well arenas. Get caught into one or volunteer to participate and you cant leave til all the challenges are beaten or you die. Arena dungeons are large sections of land that take the form of ruined cities towns ect where lots of monsters and loot spawn. Mixed are well a combination of two or all three dungeons into one. This one is a mix of a field and tower dungeon. It goes down five floors but the top area is massive and the floors below go on for thousands of miles. Kai explained. So hope you like dungeon crawls. Tomura said as he readied his sword and pistol for the upcoming monster fights. Is it dark I asked. Theres glowing crystals that are pretty well placed here and there. Kai said. The dungeon in person was amazing. We entered through one of the many tunnels the scent of metal filled the air as we walked deeper in. These tunnels had massive caverns that went easy ten to twenty feet up. Huh some bronze. Kai said kicking a wall of brown metal. Common ores are found pretty close to the entrance. Tomura brought up. How much bronze is here I asked looking over the ore deposit. Strange it almost looks like the pure metal Id wager Kai said placing a hand onto the metal. There was a pause and then the ore was out of the wall and in small bars around Kai. Fifteen pounds. Woah you did that with just your Quirk I can materialize and deconstruct any material I touch. Helps when the ore is already pure when it spawns. Even if its bronze its still pure and it can sell for quite a bit to the right blacksmith. Tomura brought up. Ive never seen such pure metal before. I said lifting one of the small ingots. And this just appears here Every year yes. Kai said with a nod. Or sooner depending on the dungeon. Tomura added. We walked deeper in Kai stopping me from falling into a spike pit and Tomura dealing with what looked like I wanna say Goblins So where do these Mana Gems spawn Second Floor. The floor boss should be dead already so we can just walk right through and get to digging them up. Kai said. We could also just kill some monsters get enough rem and buy him a mana regeneration bracelet. Tomura brought up. Nah internal regen is better in the long run and a bracelet can break. True. Tomura conceded. We walked further in and actually came across another adventurer. She was in all riot armor and just waved at us as we passed. Well that was nice. The boss room was massive filled with tree vines and glowing crystals. He wasnt here so we moved on through. The second floor was a but darker and there were more zombies and even walking skeletons held together by dead tree vines. Between the three of us they werent hard at all and with my fire spell it was only a few minutes lost. As we walked around a corner I saw a small light blue glowing gem unlike the other crystals that give light. Theres one. Kai said placing a hand on the dirt around it and making it all move away from the gem. How bigs the gem Tomura asked. So far it looks about average. Hopefully this is a deposit of them and not just the one. How big can these ore and gem deposits get I asked. On Dechamore Well You know how big these planets get so to the core maybe the size of the moon back in your old world. Bigger. Are you serious Yes and they keep getting bigger depending on what planet youre on. Tomura answered readily. Not counting whats on the moons suns comets and asteroids. Kai added. Wait suns You can explore the suns here Oh yeah been there once. Pretty neat not as hot or blinding as youd imagine. Theres even people living on the suns. Tomura added. Thats wow I said blankly. At some point you just stop getting surprised. Kai said with a shrug. And when you do get surprised its all the sweeter. Tomura pointed out. There were two of the Mana gems there and Kai told me how to absorb them. Once I did my Mana changed to be one hundred. Two more and youd be good. Letsgah Kai said Tomura pushing him aside. I looked down the way and saw the figure of what looked like an adorable brown fox maybe Its an Eevee Tomura was really happy about seeing that really fluffy fox thing. Its adorable. What is it I asked. Kai shook off the shove Tomura gave him. A Pokemon. Eevee. Pretty unique one and thats saying something given their breed. Its not a monster is it Technically yes but also no. Pokemon are a lot like animals but with powers and such. You can capture them in these things called Pokeballs and from there train them. Should...I let Midoriya do it Tomura asked already having a red and white ball in his hand I guess that was what was used to catch this pokemon You go ahead you look you want them and youd probably know better how to take care of them than I do at the moment. Well...youre not wrong. He said. And thank you. He said as he tried to catch it. He threw the ball the little creature getting bumped on the head by the ball. The ball opened up and a flash if white light and it was on the floor. It shook three times before clicking. Yay Tomura cheered happily walking over and picking up the ball. You did always want a pet. Kai said with a chuckle. Gonna name it Hmm He hummed as he tossed the ball the ball opening as a flash of light poured out of it and the Eevee came out just fine. Not sure yet you gotta name Kai Depends is it a boy or girl Tomura picked up the Eevee and looked them over. Its a girl. He said as he started to cradle the Eevee and started to pet her. Shes so cute. I said seeing the Eevee look like they really enjoyed the affection. Maybe name her Ura Kai shrugged. Ura sounds good. He nodded. And yes Eevees are just adorable and this is only one of the...many many pokemon in the world. You said it was unique what makes it so unique I asked. Well all Pokemon can evolve. And Eevees are unique in that they can evolve into any of the different types. After the war that was expanded. Eevee is the most diverse and versatile of pokemon. People have used magic and genetic cloning and other such methods to make Eevee copy cats but over all the original is best. Kai explained. Eevee is the only pokemon that can evolve into one of the sixteen element types and through some weird genetic shenanigans with certain items they can be dual typed versions of its evolutions. Tomura added. Originally now thanks to The Mother its basically all the elements and combo elements and theres a lot that little fox dog thing can do. Eeva The Eevee Ura said happily. It can talk I asked. Well most of them can only say their species name or some noises but some can learn to speak English with a lot of effort special items or by giving them a telepathy ability. Kai said. Or you can learn their language cause damn near everything has its own specialty language no matter the race or age funnily enough. Huh. Thats really interesting. I was honestly surprised such a small adorable creature had so much potential. We went further in after a while Tomura letting Ura the Eevee ride on his head like a hat. We ran into a few more zombies and large mole monsters that werent too difficult and even got a pickaxe from one of those moles. We did come across another Mana Gem but it was just the one and we kept on after I absorbed it. We came across a large chamber where someone was setting up camp. Either theyre quite literally camping this area or we finally found a safe area. Tomura said honestly. Neither We jumped seeing a wideeyed blond girl with a fairly round face and large smile pop out from the tent. Hi Im Himiko Toga. Hello Toga. Tomura nodded. Im Tomura Shimura. He introduced himself politely. Kai Chisaki. Kai said. Izuku Midoriya. I said with a nod. Sup So what brings you three here Were finding Mana Gems for Midoriya here. Kai said. You Im hunting for those Mole Monsters. Ironic we just killed some a while back. Darn it I swore if I made enough noise here theyd go for me. Or maybe its because youre being too loud and they are not going for you. Tomura pointed out. Theyre monsters they should be attracted to all the noise. She huffed. Ive been here for two days already. Why I asked. The Moles I need their blood to learn about their abilities first hand. Toga stated. Their blood She nodded. Yup its how my Quirk Transform works. I take a few drops of blood and I can transform Into the person or animal whose blood I drank. When it comes to monsters and animals I can transform into them and use their abilities and all that but with people I can only use their power based abilities so gathering monster blood is just more useful for me in combat and such. Oh wow Does the amount of blood you drink determine the time you can stay in a form She smiled nodding. Yup the more blood the longer I can stay in a form. Its why I need this Mole form theres a Vampire here as a secret boss and if I can get bit and become one the Vampire racial skill branches will so help me out in terms of my quirk. Sounds good. Tomura nodded. Where would the secret boss be Right below us. Toga said simply. Only way in is by finding a mole monster tunnel that leads there but if I catch one and drink some blood from it I can just dig myself down to him. Yeah that sounds about right. Tomura nodded. If its a tunnel you need I can make you one. Kai offered. My quirk lets me deconstruct and reconstruct matter so making a tunnel will be easy. But wheres the fun in that Tomura joked. Either way. Toga shrugged. So you three gonna head off or do you wanna help a girl out Help you become a vampire I asked. She nodded. Yup Help me out with that boss and become a vampire and I promise I can pay the favor back. Well that also depends on if Midoriya wants to tag along. Tomura brought up. Well yeah. If Im gonna be a hero in this world then I have to help. I said. What is this Vampire anyway His name is Count Phineas and as a secret boss hes about level two in strength. Hm any weapons we should be concerned about Kai asked. Just a short sword but its also imbued with a vampiric enchantment so with each cut it drains some of your blood and heals him. Thats a bit of a bitch with him being a vampire. Tomura sighed. Well that is probably the point. Kai shrugged. Can we handle that I asked. Oh yeah Tomura and I can handle him easy enough. Poor bastard wont know what hit him. Tomura chuckled. Awh thanks you guys I have some spare stuff and gear here so if you need or want anything go for it most of it is just drops from monsters and stuff I brought out just to drop and make noise to attract the moles. Well what do ya got Tomura asked wondering what Toga had to offer. Ammo some weapons spell scroll nicknacks. Some food too. Toga said. Spell scrolls I asked. Yup theyre in a box inside the tent. Just open them and youll have the spell learned instantly. Alright well check and were allowed to enter your tent Tomura asked. Even if you told us we can its better to double check cause...certain rules might crop up sometimes. Of course. Its mostly just full of stuff. Take what you need or want and well head down When you three are ready. Thank you. Tomura nodded while heading into Togas tent first. I followed and found the spell scrolls. There were five. I opened one and jumped when it incinerated the second I opened it. Spell Learned Blessed Barrier Create a Sheild of magic that is especially effective at repelling unholy magics and entities. That wasnt what I was expecting I said surprised. The matrix amount of magic all of that was just in my head. Woah. What did you learn there Midoriya Tomura asked while perusing what was around. Blessed Barrier. I didnt expect it to imprint the knowledge into my head though. Scrolls tend to do that when you first read it. He said honestly. And thats good with that spell you can block anything that Vampire would normally have. Well thats useful at least. I looked at the four others and began opening them. Spell Learned Conjure Wolf Created an ethereal wolf to attack or defend at your order. Spell Learned Thunder Shoot out a bolt of lightning that deals high damage. Spell Learned Sonic Clap By clapping your hands you can send out a sonic wave that harms enemies and people that have ultra sensitive hearing. Spell Learned Slumber Song Make enemies fall asleep simply by gently singing a lullaby. If the lullaby in use is personal to the target the effect of the sleeping spell is doubled and the time spent in sleep is also doubled. Conjure Wolf Thunder Sonic Clap and Slumber Song. Huh I thought aloud. Sounds like a pretty good list of spells so far. Tomura nodded. Its definitely diverse. Theres a lot of possible ways of using them. They almost sound like Quirks if Im being honest. Especially Slumber Song and Sonic Clap. Maybe thats why I prefer Magic it feels more like a quirk Maybe. What did you find Standard stuff. He said. Knives swords lightsabers an M203 Grenade Launcher simple stuff. Uh huh. While Kai and Tomura kept looking through stuff I skimmed through my spell book. Woah theres even an Explosion spell. Hm I wonder I drew the matrix in the palm of my other hand and aimed up. It shouldnt be too big the book said the size of the Explosion is dependent on how much Mana I pour into it. One percent lets see there was a small spark in my palm followed by a rush of heat and wind. Ive seen Kacchan make way bigger but it was good enough. I grinned looking back through my book. Gonna show off youre better at explosions than Bakugo Tomura asked having seen the small little explosion. Uh if you mean the one from back home how can I No way back. And I doubt I could surpass Katsuki shes from before the war and a Time Walker. I kinda doubt I could pass her in terms of fire power. There are more than just that one Katsuki out and about. Tomura brought up. ... Even so it wouldnt be the same they arent Kacchan same name voice quirk still not him. You never know you might just find your Bakugo someday. Tomura shrugged. What do you mean Its...pretty rare but sometimes people meet others from their same world. Tomura said. I dont know the statistics but its like...uncommon is not having a quirk rare is being born with two quirks and pretty rare is being born with three quirks. I have a feeling its more uncommon than that still Id prefer to run into my mom again for all I know its been a day there too a year or even a lifetime. My dads always working so I mostly grew up with mom. Shes always been super prone to worrying about me I cant even imagine what me being gone is doing to her Best not to think about it too much. Tomura said nervously. Think one day well be able to go back Or bring them here somehow Impossible to tell. He sighed out. If Mother hasnt even figured something out about how isekais work then probably no one will. Im sure something will happen. Kai said. I asked mom about that once and she just said to wait and see. Given her job and all that she knows something but clearly isnt allowed to tell so she just told me to wait and see. That means something in our lifetimes will let us see our Homeworlds again. We just have to be patient is all I guess. How much you want to bet that its not were in a different realm and just we havent found the right planet yet Tomura pointed out. Doubt it all planets not colonized are blank slates remember Pitch black like coal til someone lands on it. Kai said tossing a few books aside. Besides if it was that easy the Scouters Guild would have found something. Scouters Guild I asked looking the books over. Prize People and You Familiars Monthly and Enchantments 101 101 basic beginners enchantments. They sail out deep into space past the borders of the colonized areas of space and planets looking for anything and everything of interest. Or first dibs on new dungeons or resources. Theyre probably not looking in the right places then. Tomura pointed out. So its basically anything you can consider a possibility about us is on the table then I asked picking up the last book. Popular Guilds to Consider. Pretty much. Tomura shrugged. Mother fought for that future during the war as far as we know or whoever or whatever she was beforehand given Mother is more of a title from what some historians say Why is she called that Why Mother Theres debate over it given that practically no one ever sees them no one remembers her origins after god knows how long and a lot of other things. Tomura explained. But Mother is theorized to be exactly that the Mother of Creation the one that started mothering Admins way back when and her abilities making you incapable of fighting due to reasons unknown but could be guessed as a child is near its mother so why would they be mad. Tomura explained. Youd have to ask either historians priests of the Church of Mother or Time Walkers or Guild Master Lord but good luck talking to that old man hes almost as reclusive if not more so than Mother. Tomura explained. And before you ask on how or why I know this much random knowledge I was really bored waiting for a shipment on a new game even Assistant Shops have wait times. Huh. And this Family of Heroes I believe those were the people that helped fought in the ancient war that started all of this. He said. Their names were sadly lost to time but what they were wasnt if memory serves. So does that make Katsuki part of the family of heroes That made the both pause. I never thought about it. Kai said clearly trying to think about that. Well...I doubt it. Tomura said. Cause the Family of Heroes hasnt been seen since the war and theres not much if any information on who or what they were before the war and Katsuki is here with us even if they fought in the war as they said. But if they arent remembered anymore then wouldnt it make sense they are just living around and among us like everyone else I asked. Possibly. I know of at least one member of The Family that now is a Familiar hard to find her but I hear those that have said shes unbeatable. Who was it again Tomura asked. Peppermint Black. Kai said. Oh yeah. Tomura nodded. Now I remember yeah theyre extremely powerful. How strong is she I asked. I heard that she got found by a level three adventure and she dragged him to a level five and cleared it for him just to give herself a stretch. Kai said. Which to clear out a level five dungeon the only level to be not only the hardest but truly lethal to people as a stretch truly shows how powerful she is. Tomura said. Dont remember how she was found cause the lucky bastard might have gotten them from either a super boss in that level three or the Loot Dimension. Theres a loot dimension Where else do you think all the crap monsters and dungeons drop Kai said. Everything a dungeon can drop and does comes from there. And if youre stupid lucky and I mean istupidlyi lucky you can get a ticket to that dimension for like ten minutes. Tomura said honestly. A complete free for all. Kai said. Woah. Thats really cool. I said. I think the last one to get a ticket was some homeless person that had nothing to their name besides a knife beat a level one dungeon and became a world renown adventurer after he used that ticket. How does one in a world like this end up with nothing other than a knife to their name Gambling pissing off bad people laziness and thieves. The Thieves Guilds can really rob you blind if they get the opportunity. And on that day he learned to never squander anything again and to make sure at least someones sober before going on a binge. Oh. Well Im glad things worked out for him. So are you both ready to go I had the books and used the spell scrolls so Im good. I just picked up a few potions and that was it. Kai said. You ready Tomura Hmm Tomura hummed again as he looked over things only to grab three bracelets and tossing me and Kai one. Resist All minor bracelets wear them and you get minor resistances to everything. He explained while putting his on. Fair enough. Kai said putting it on. Guess its better than me not having any resistances. I said placing it on too. Alright Toga were ready I called out the blond girl rushing into the tent now. Sweet She said raising a fist into the air. Lets go meet this Count. One stairway. Kai said placing both hands on the ground. There was a pause then some small cracks quickly followed by the ground violently shaking as suddenly a stairway down opened before him. Ladies first. Heh such a gentleman. Toga said as she began her way down followed by the three of us. So know anything else about the boss besides his vampire abilities and the knife Tomura asked Toga. Well he drops a lot of stuff and the Adventures Guild pays in good loot and money for beating him. He does always drop some raw ores and gems. Toga said. Mana gems too I asked. Yeah. Average of three to five I think. Perfect. Anything else of note His sword too from what Ive seen. Some other good Vampire based gear. Good enough. Tomura nodded. So after you become a vampire...will you have to follow his orders or will you have your own free will Ill have my own will youre thinking Ghouls. Toga said. We emerged from the stairway into a chamber filled with glowing red crystals lighting the room in a crimson glow. In the center of it half buried was a black wooden coffin covered in chains and surrounded by rusted metal crosses. Thats worrying. I said swallowing as we kept moving. Tad over dramatic. Tomura shrugged. Its a boss thats their thing. Kai said as we got to the floor I screamed seeing the blood and the bones and the oh God Dude relax its all fake. Kai said. Wait what I stammered. Yeah its decorative. So its not real Oh it is its just not from people. Its like if amusement park attractions actually had real effort put into it and the clowns were paid to stab you. Tomura shrugged. ... Isekai Toga asked. Its his second day. Kai informed. Heh cute. Hes handling it rather well. Tomura added. Are all dungeon bosses this bad I asked. About an even half. Mostly depends on what they are and how strong they are. Kai said with a shrug. It also gets worse. Tomura chuckled. It pays good though from what I hear. Toga said. This is a job How Why You didnt think all the bosses just randomly spawned in did you Tomura asked. I uh did actually Well very few work like that. Tomura said honestly. But most have people from the guilds be bosses for dungeons mostly. Its a living and a show of powermeans of finding a good challenge. Toga said. Also if youre outstandingly bored. Tomura added. Or a nap Came from the coffin the lid flying off breaking the chains and making the crosses fall over. He had silver and black hair with green eyes and wore a dusty cloak. Christ I enjoy my naps here when you all dont bother me. No need to be all grumpy besides you could have gotten your sleep at home. Tomura pointed out. This is my home. The Boss Count Phineas said. He sighed jumping out of his coffin. Honestly I thought Id get to nap more given those stupid moles almost never dig their tunnels down this way. Well anyways. Tomura started. Toga here wanted to ask you something. He said while motioning to Toga. Son of a if youre another Twilight fan girl I swear He groaned. She said becoming a vampire will help with her quirk. Tomura said simply. It would help a lot. Toga said. If I turn you will you leave Phineas said. Do we get your drops Kai asked. No Thats not how this works Oh just bite me and you boys can argue it out with bullets and swords. Toga said holding up a bare arm. Fine. Phineas groaned as Toga walked over to him. He bit her arm and I watched as her skin turned just a shade paler. Once he stopped bitting and let her go she walked over back to the steps. You boys can keep what he drops Ill wait for you over here. Toga said watching as her bite mark healed leaving only a scare. Alright. Tomura nodded as he prepared to fight. Wait but were fighting a person. I said worried about this. Hes a dungeon boss if it helps just think of him like a villain. Kai said inching his hand closer to the ground as he began to kneel down. Sure kid whatever gets you to sleep at night. Phineas said pulling his sword from his scabbard. Lets just get this over with so I can get back to sleep. Then lets get started. Tomura said as he fired a shot at the vampire. I watched in shock as Phineas deflected it with his sword jumping as Kai turned the ground below him into large spikes. Phineas slashed at the ones that got close then kicked them back at Kai making him stop attacking to dodge as Tomura kept shooting off while Phineas kept dodging Wait maybe. I reached out grabbing a bullet that was still in mid air and lowered it. I winced as it hit Phineas in the knee. Oh son of a He huffed his leg fixing itself as he began casting fire spells at us. I brought up Blessed Barrier. Tomura got under it quickly as Kai kept using his quirk to stay on the offence with Phineas. I didnt think moving the bullet would work. I said keeping my eye on Kai and Phineas. A lot of things work if you try them out. Tomura said simply. Hes faster than I expected He can deflect your shots and dodge Kais attacks. Hes still a vampire so that makes him an undead right Yes. Tomura nodded. Whats the plan Well your Quirk can decay him then even if you can get a limb off on him that should cripple him enough for you or Kai to deliver a final blow. The question is how do we get him still long enough for you to get at him Kai could hold him for long enough with his quirk. Tomura brought up. If he can get an opening he could. Do you have any other weapons aside from your handgun and Sword My hands. Tomura said simply. And some minor magics why do you ask We need to create a big enough distraction for Kai to trap him. Wait. I remembered looking through my assistant. Will these work I asked handing Tomura a box of Spiral Nuke Bullets. He cant deflect them theyll explode and I can use telekinesis to move them so at least one hits him. And you wondered why people made bullets as strong as nukes. Tomura chuckled. Its probably overkill but should work. I said. Tomura loaded up the Spiral Nuke Bullets and began firing. Phineas tried to deflect one into to have it blow up on impact. The Explosion shook the chamber and sent him into the nearby wall. Kai quickly touched the ground sending a large chunk of dirt up and around him encasing him in hard dirt. Tomura gave off a few more shots around him. Oh fuck Phineas yelped as they exploded. Secret Boss Count Phineas Defeated. Rewards Count Phineas Sword Leech Tooth 1 Vampiric Pig Leather armor set 1 Gold Ore 10 Silver Ore 12 Iron Ore 9 Mana Gem 7 Fire Gem 5 Terra Gem 3 Prize Pod Person 1 Wait we we won a person I asked worried. As I said that a large pod pure white and metal with a light blue glass cover appeared in front of us. We could only see someones silhouette inside and on the glass was the engraving of a heart. And a Lover class. Someone here might be getting a girlfriendwife. Kai said with a grin. Wait what I asked. Did we forget to mention that Tomura asked. I know you mentioned something about a princess in a tower thing with people who appear in dungeons like this but not this. Its like this. There are several classes if Prize People. Allies are people who will fight with you for a year while you journey after a year they can choose to stay with you or leave and do their own thing. Servant class do housework and tasks for you also for a year then they can do whatever. Theres other various classes but in this case we have the Lover class which is by far the most interesting. They dont just open up they only open for the person who can love them and they can love back. In other words there are lover class people in pods like this that Havent even gotten out cause no one has been a match for them. Kai explained. So theyre just stuck in there if no one is compatible I asked. Asleep til their love finds them. Sad really. Its the whole reason the Match Makers Guild exists. Well lets see who theyll open for. Tomura said while walking over to the pod. He placed a hand on it. Nothing. He shrugged Kai doing the same and still nothing. Well go on lay a hand on it Midoriya. Kai said. I uh are you sure I doubt it will even work for me if it didnt for you two. I said looking at this persons silhouette. They looked pretty tall. Third time is the charm. Tomura shrugged. Besides youre more likable than either of us. Speak for yourself bro in case you forget I do get laid. Kai said. In your dreams. Tomura rolled his eyes. Which is technically still a real place fuck you. Kai just laughed. I shook my head and slowly placed a hand on the pod. I jumped as the glass on it glowed brightly then vanished in a puff of light that floated up and disappeared. I looked inside seeing she had cat ears and tail long claw like nails and she wore an all white jumpsuit. Her skin tone was a light orange and her hair color a dark orange. She sat up opening her eyes and yawning. Her eyes were a deep amazing emerald color. Hey there love She said at me with a wink. Ll what I stammered as she got up. She was just shy of my height and gifted. Quite gifted in her body. You opened my pod so youre my love. She said almost simply as she then hugged me. It was then I found out just how thin her jumpsuit is. Kai could not stop laughing at my blush. Way to go there casanova. Tomura laughed at my plight. Iuh so I said managing to get her to let go of me. Whats your name Delilah. She said. No last name. At least not yet. She winked at me then licked my cheek. You think hes got enough blood I heard Tomura ask someone as I slowly came to. Cause he kind of acted like a rocket with that nose bleed. Still hilarious though. I heard Kai say. Ugh what happened I asked sitting up as I felt something soft and heavy on my arm. I looked and bbb Boobs Morning sleepy. Delilah said to me holding my arm between her breasts tightly. Whats the last thing you remember Tomura asked curiously. I uh we we were fighting Phineas then Delilahs pod I stammered trying to get my arm free from her ironclad grip. And then she licked you on the cheek to which your nose projectile shot out blood with enough force to rocket you into the wall. Kai finished. We brought you home and mom gave you a blood transfusion to make up for the blood you lost. Delilah here hasnt let you go the whole time youve been out. Oh I said. How tight is her grip From what we can gather Delilahs race has a stupidly high base strength and are natural grapplers...so have fun trying to get away if shes into cuddles. Tomura said having noticed my failing attempts at escape. I am. Plus I can never lose you either. She said finally letting go of my arm. What you an expert tracker Kai asked. Its her abilities. One in particular We looked at the doorway seeing Katsuki enter. Allow me to show it off. She then brought out a pistol. My eyes widened and jaw dropped as she fired hitting Delilah between the eyes. Katsuki why what I turned back to yell at her and saw Delilah standing next to Katsuki. I looked back at where she was before... nothing. Hhow Yeah respawns take an hour usually and and leave a body behind. Kai said looking concerned. Like I said its her ability. The Legendary Ability Shrodingers Cat. A living paradox the likes of which the Time Walkers have been looking for since forever and you get a wife with that ability in a dungeon the high ups are gonna flip but thats life. She sighed. Its even more funny considering this ability is only given out once and cant be obtained til the current owner dies naturally from madness. And no one would really know who had it before cause it wouldnt be common knowledge if they didnt do an Arena match. Tomura shrugged. And I dont plan on being in any. Delilah shrugged walking back over to me and sitting next to me. So how is this going to work I asked pointing a thumb at Delilah. Well her pod opened for you. So shes your girlfriendwife. You two are sharing the room. Katsuki said. Bbut shes a Look I know its weird to you know but trust me when a pod opens for you the person inside is someone you will learn to love. Shes already very smitten with you Midoriya get to know her. She is a person after all. Y... Yeah. I said looking at Delilah. She was smiling at me well she is cute... Well shall we give the two lovebirds some privacy Kai asked. Everyone nodded and left leaving Delilah and I alone in my room So I said. How old are you Fifteen. She said. Wait really Yeah. She said with a nod. Huh. I wasnt sure given your height. Oh dont worry Ill grow bigger Heh right so what other abilities do you have Advanced accuracy rank 1 through 4 wall climbing iron steel and titanium claws and primal senses. No quirk abilities Nope. Hm What about you I was in a prize pod so sure I have likes dislikes and all that but no real past to speak of just knowledge on stuff Ive never actually seen or studied. Tell me about your life Izuku. I wanted to correct her about my name but I decided not to this isnt home isnt japan. Going by my first name shouldnt be too bad. And her voice saying my name does sound nice. I sat there for hours with her telling her all about Japan and the heroes and quirks about mom kacchan everything big or small and she sat there listening about it all. When I finished she leaned against me and I didnt flinch away. Well I know someday you will be a hero to everyone but today and forever you are my hero Izuku. If you didnt try and open my pod who knows how long Id have been stuck there waiting with the Matchmakers guild. I surprised myself and took her hand. Thank you Delilah.,Teen And Up Audiences,Not Found
https://archiveofourown.org/works/33562567,Open World: Level Up,I couldnt take it anymore. The insults the rejection the loneliness My hooves hit the ground hard and fast. My vision was blurred as I let out my cries and sorrows to the moon. Im Button Mash and Im a loser. Fourteen and no cutie mark the filly of my dreams or at least my crush since I was nine rejected me for that dragon Spike. To make it all worse it finally dawned on me that aside from I had no friends. The others at school were more or less just talking to me because of school work. Those who talk to me after or before school just laugh at my lack of a cutie mark and push me around. I finally just stopped somewhere and let it fall out. Holding all this sadness in has been hard and I dont want to worry mom with all my problems she has enough to worry about. I wasnt sure how much time passed before I calmed down enough to give a sigh and think things over. Stupid Tiara and her ugh. Stupid Spike. Damn it. I huffed. Diamond Tiara was my bully for a long time growing up. Shes nice and changed but still the hurt is there from the past but I cant hate her now. And I cant hate Spike just because Sweetie Belle fell for him. Ive never even talked to him before but Ive heard hes nice and considerate so at least I know Sweetie will be cared for. I took a long deep breath and sighed. I needed this to just vent out privately. I rubbed the red out of my eyes and looked around. Huh where am Growling echoed around me. My eyes went wide and pupils shrunk as soon several glowing green pairs of eyes were watching me from some nearby bushes. Timber wolves crap I ran into the Everfree I jumped up the wooden wolves slowly walking out ready to chase me down as they matched my movements I gulped chuckled and bolted. The living sticks barking as they chased me and trying to bite at my legs. How did I not realize I was running right into the Everfree I just had to run off to cry and vent I couldnt just bottle it all up and let it fester til it turned into brain cancer and killed me like a normal pony. What I developed a morbid sense of humor and way of looking at things as I got older dont judge. I yipped as one nearly bit my hind right leg. I responded with a still running buck to its chin and thankfully didnt fall down and kept moving. I made a rapid turn into the denser trees to lose them and found myself falling down a small cliffside hill into the mud well at least I didnt break anything. I sat up and wiped the mud off my face and looked up at where I fell from. Thats pretty steep. At least two stories. Well it looks like the Timber wolves Dont wanna try their luck. And screw off you walking firewood. I huffed at them why did that rock move I got up and began walking backwards as one two five nine snakes Nope not snakes heads. Heads with long necks Oh fuck thats a baby Hydra that would be kinda cool if it wasnt looking at me like a midnight snack It roared at me and I was running again. Next time I get the idea to vent and cry Ill just do it in my pillow like a filly who got her heart broken. I rushed myself through more trees and bushes hopling the thicker foliage would hold them back. It at least seemed to slow them down. I in my complete lack of perception fell down another hillside cliff. Ouch what the I blinked swearing I just saw numbers In the dirt a few spots where green numbers flashed along the ground. Just one and zero though in rapid fast movements they ran along the dirt then were gone Ugh I think I hit my head on this fall. I began my prior work of running for my life when the baby Hydra made itself known on the cliff above me and worked its way down. Thankfully nearby was a whole thick and near maze of trees I ran into. Even for a baby Hydra its still too big to squeeze through all these trees. I didnt stop till I ran into a much taller cliff wall largely made of rocks. I ran along the side of it for what felt like an hour til Finally finding a cave of sorts. The entrance was too small for that thing also. I entered the pitch black darkness worried of anything in here this is a dumb idea Hello Anything here wanna eat me I yelled in echo dying echo silence more silence and yay nothing is in here. I sighed finally sitting my flank down and letting my legs rest. Fuck they are sore. Earth Pony endurance my ass. Then again Ive rarely ever been physical so odds are its still my own fault for being a weak earth pony. As I let myself rest I could hear this faint echo like running water. Is there a river in this cave Shit I wish I could see cause I am so thirsty. Do I risk it well if Im gonna bunker down for a while at least having water would be nice. Slowly I began moving into the caves deeper areas. I felt around feeling only dirt and small rocks around my hooves before stepping. Each step was a mystery even with my eyes a bit more adjusted to the dark it was too dark to properly see anything unless it was right in front of me. As I turned a corner into another area that water echo started to sound clearer and kinda high pitched Must be moving fast or something I shrugged and kept going careful as I felt around another turn and blinked. I spotted a glow in the back of this chamber. A glowing almost dark neon green. Maybe some of those glowing plants they talked about in school mushrooms or moss. Doubt I can eat it but light is light. The closer I got the louder that noise got. It began sounding a bit more like static from a TV than water. Finally I arrived as the source of the noise and saw numbers. A glowing bunch of numbers running up and down along itself in a circle giving off that glow and noise. Damn it. I cursed hoping for water and got whatever this is. Is this wild magic or something I sat down next to it wondering what the heck to make of it other than a convenient light source. It has to be magic or something like that. I sighed. Well at least I can sorta see the cave better. Rocks rocks ground and ceiling rock spikes I can never remember the names of. Those are made from dripping water right I got up and thanked Celestia a small pool of water formed between three close together ones and I drank the small bowel empty. Better but still what is that weird magic. I backed up a bit the small pool of strange green number magic got very big all of a sudden and kept growing. Shit I yelled trying to get around it but it already blocked the way I came from. It began covering the walls and such and I tried to stay out of it the floor beneath me getting covered in that magic that showed nothing but one and zero. To my horror the ground began sinking and then I fell into that magic screaming. Ugh fuck I groaned from under my sheets what a nightmare. Was so damn vivid. I got up blinking as The sunlight hit my eyes. I swear Princess Celestia does that on purpose to ponies. Shaking my head as I got up I rubbed the tired out of my eyes and What I yelled. I was in a fairly empty room. The only thing in it was the bed Im on a table with a vase and a small bunch of flowers in it and a picture of some weird looking like a smaller minotaur female wearing a dress made of large leaves and I think shes pregnant Where the hell am I I saw the door and got up to open it peeking outside I saw a hallway where walking out from one room was a dragon She was dressed in a nuns attire but pink and blue over black and white. She turned to look at me and She has large yellow stilted eyes orangered scales and something that looked like leathery hair along her forehead. Wow two in one day. She said looking surprised as she closed the door. I gulped. Uh Hi. I said nervously. Hello there. She said sounding so nice and gave me a warm smile that calmed my nerves down. She walked over and kneeled down to me. Wow she was tall a little over twice my height. Did you just wake up here too Yes. Yes Wait too There are others Lets talk inside the room real quick. She said. The two of us went back inside the room and both took a seat on the bed. So what is your name Im Button Mash. And you are I am Carla. Button what is the last thing you remember before waking up here I was running. I had some monsters chasing me and took shelter in a cave. I thought I heard running water and left to find it and found this glowing weird magic filled with ones and zeros. I turned around for a second and it suddenly became huge and and I fell into it am I not in Equestria anymore Did I get teleported to the Dragon Lands or something Carla looked at me giving me a sad smile and held my hoof. Button this isnt even your world. My what This is the church of The Mother. One of many and people like you sometimes show up here from other worlds other realities entirely. We call them Displaced or Izikai. Another reality Like a parallel universe or something This cant be real thats thats science fiction then again Princess Twilight does have that mirror How do I get back home Im afraid there is no known way. Since this reality was made people like you have been showing up and not a single one has ever found their way back to their original reality most settle in on this realitys version of their home. This worlds version That is a long story. Do you want to hear it now or after youve had time to process this information I I think I wanna hear it now. Well this reality was once a massive co existing mix of parallel realities called Reflections or Realms. One day a great threat came to destroy it all. A family of the most powerful people in the realms combated this evil. United they matched this evil but then they became one. One all powerful being called The Mother. She motioned to the picture of that lady creature on the wall. She defeated the evil and saved all realities and then remade all the realms into what they are now. Infinite ever expanding ever exploring. Dangerous and safe beautiful and terrifying. Perfectly in Harmony between good and evil. Thats wow and where am I Location wise We are some miles outside the town of Coal Vien. Its a mining town. Lemme guess coal Heh. Yes. Some iron and whatever else spawns in and Im sorry Spawn Like in video games Heh that is a good comparison. You see what makes this reality infinite isnt just the ever growing size its also the worlds themselves. Once a year on the first day of the new year things like mines dungeon bosses and such all regain all the ores items and such they had mined out over the year. So this reality is more or less a giant video game Pretty close yes. Huh I said thinking hard about that. So what happens to me now Well most Izikai after processing this information try to do something. Most go off to explore and adventure and others try and regain some sense of normalcy. So do I have to go back to school School You were in school Yeah. Im fourteen. Ah I thought you looked a bit small. Well in that case there is a place you can go to finish school up and learn about this world and choose what you want to do. What is it The Caretakers Guild. The what Theyre like a boarding school for Isikaied children like yourself. They train and teach you about all this world has to offer and when you graduate whether you want to adventure travel or just love normally youll be ready for it. So this school guild thing has others like me Other izikai kids Well guess Ill at least fit in then I know it might not sound the best but they are the best option given your age. I promise they will take care of you and you will have fun. Yeah okay then. I was surprised when it was another pony who picked me up for the Caretakers Guild. He was a Pegasus all white with purple eyes and yellow mane. Button Mash. He asked looking me over. I nodded. I am Echo Dash. Are you feeling well I guess. I said. Honestly I felt empty. Hollow actually. Same thing I guess. Before I take you to the Caretakers Guild I am going to equip you with an Assistant. He said his wife pulling out a white slip of paper with some symbol on it. An Assistant Its a techno magical device everyone in this reality has. It makes life easier in every aspect. Do you primarily use your right or left hoof Right. I said. I held up my left leg and he placed the paper along it just above the joint to my hoof and I watched with wide eyes as it melted into my skin leaving that mark on me almost like how a cutie mark would appear. So what happens woah New Registered User. Name Button Mash. Race Equestrian Earth Pony Age 14 Cutie Mark NA Those worlds appeared for a bit then were replaced by a small line of hearts in the bottom left of my vision and a small map of where I was in the right bottom corner. Woah What is this thing Why are their hearts and a map in my vision Those hearts tell how healthy you are. Get sick or get hurt and they go down. They go all the way down and youll either pass out or die. The map helps you navigate places. You can customize them or just remove them if you want. Huh. Ill keep them for now. So if I get hurt Ill know how close to dying I get to good to know I think Yeah dying sucks. ... Have you died before Mostly when I was exploring and it wasnt fun. Never is. ... Im sorry what Oh she didnt tell you Echo Dash asked looking over at Carla by the door way who shook her head. Ah. Well you see Button there are only three things in all of this wide and vast reality that can actually kill us and keep us dead. Anything else well just wake back up in our beds and if for some reason our beds arent around then we wake up in a church like this one. ... So we respawn after dying Yes. ... Cool. I said genuinely surprised that Im pretty much immortal now. That goes for me too right Yes. All Izikai also gain our realities ability to respawn after dying and our longer lifespans. Longer life spans Yes. We can effectively live well forever. Once we stop growing physically we dont actually age or grow older unless we want to look older. Basically we can do whatever we please here Button. ...how old are you 2083 years old. ... And are you also Izikai Yes. ... Wow Heh and compared to some I am still basically a child. Echo Dash said with a laugh. Well come in then. The Caretakers Guild already has a room in one of the dorms for you. Rright. I said getting off the bed and walking over to Echo Dash. He did something on his Assistant and What the I yelped and jumped. There was a flash of white and we were now in a hallway that looked almost like Canterlot. Did we teleport Yes. Echo said with a nod. But youre a Pegasus I told you Button we can do as we please here. Magic is just the tip of the iceberg. ... Cool. I said in awe. Come along. Echo said as I followed him down the hall. We are in the Caretakers Guild Equestria section. The familiar environment should help you adjust to life here and keep you comfortable. Your classes begin tomorrow and your roommate is waiting for you. Huh. So how often will I see you around Ill check in with you two daily. I oversee the dorm you both are living in so fairly often. I am your appointed guardian while you live here. Ah. And how many classes do I have What kinds Typically in a day youll have three to five ranging from the basics in mathematics science history and of course magic combat and other optional classes. Combat I get magic but why combat Youll learn soon enough. Your roommate will inform you on more also here is your key. They held out a small chrome key with their wing that I took in my hoof. So whats my roommate like Smart talented same as us walks on four hooves and has been Izikai for about three years now. Wow. Yeah shes a trooper. Wait she Yes. Im sharing a dorm with a girl Youll both have private rooms that are only sharing the livingroom and kitchendinning room. The doors to your bedrooms are enchanted so only you can enter yours and only she can enter hers and the shared rooms have cameras so well know if you two get up to some funny business. Uh that works I guess. There was a bit of science til we arrived at a room that shared a number with my key. Room 400. Ill see you in the morning before classes start alright Uh sure. Your room has a few things youll be needing a weekly allowance bags books cloths ect. Thank you. Think nothing of it. With that said Echo teleported away. So neat. With a sigh I opened the door and walked inside holy crap its huge The living room had a large fluffy looking couch nice carpet rug neat white wall paint and a massive tv with a flat screen Is it plastic How did they do that Hi I tensed up that that voice I turned around seeing a pink filly with a purple and white striped mane Diamond Tiara Shes my roommate No no calm down Button. This cant be the same Tiara. Carla said this reality was made up of multiverses so that should mean shes a doppelganger no that sounds like shes a fake Shes a something. Hello She said poking me with the feather of Wait I blinked. She has wings Are you broken I shook my head. Sorry sorry you just Your name isnt Diamond Tiara is it She nodded. Yeah. I guess you knew a version of me from your world too then huh Lots of the others here all say the me from their worlds was mean or a bitch or worse. Same for you I take it She was but she changed. Shes nice just still would freeze up when she was around is all. Yeesh She hurt you bad then huh Heh only emotionally. Oh Well So any questions Well have you died and respawned before Once. Combat class got a little too intense and I woke up in my bad an hour later. Oh. Is there like a penalty for dying No just an hour or two missing and the old body to clean up. Old body Well they dont just up and vanish. If you wanna get rid of it you just tap the spot where your Assistant was and poof gone. And it has to be who previously owned it Yup. Gross. Yup. Can you use magic She raised a hoof a small ball of fire appearing in it I just stared at. Fire Ice Terra and Electronium. So cool How do I do that Various ways easiest is to absorb Elemental gems like I did and most everyone does. Instant means of learning basic spells and such. You can read books and such and practice them. There are a lot of ways. She said the fire poofing out. What will my classes be like Fairly basic. For this reality at least. Math and all that is so much more advanced most Izikai like us are all only studying what we can understand and only a few try and learn the more advanced stuff. Ah. So where is my room Oh left hall on the right. Cool. So we cook our own meals then Heh. Come one. Diamond Tiara said. Confused I walked over with her to the stove in the kitchen. Wow this place is neat. She gave me a smile as she tapped this screen Yeah a screen on the stove and clicked an image of what looked like a Haybruger and frise And I watched as potatoes hay pots pans and oil all began floating about and The kitchen cooks by itself Yup. I still sometimes watch it cook with no one there. So cool. Ill say. Now then anything else How did you move on. I finally said looking at the floor now. When you I didnt. She said putting a hoof to my chest and I looked up at her. She had a smile on but tears fell from her eyes. I miss them all the time. I was going to be a big sister and now Ill never know if I had a little brother or little sister. Ill never see mom and dad get older never get to work in dads store It hurts to think about it to remember but all in all I keep hope. Someday maybe something will happen and I can see them again and if that day comes be it going back or them arriving here I wanna be someone somepony they can really see did something amazing with their life and have so many stories to tell them. I did something in that moment I have never done before. I hugged Diamond Tiara. She returned it. She isnt like the Tiara I know. Nothing at all the one I knew became better through understanding and a second chance. Shes been through hardships Im experiencing and working to live with it. After a bit we broke the hug she cleaned off tears with her eyes with her wings. Heh good thing I dont believe in make up. And its official this is SO not the Tiara I know. So I guess youll wanna check your room. Ill be here watching TV. Heh sure. Ill be out in a bit with more questions. I said with a nod and headed towards where my room was. I felt better. Everypony wait everyone Yeah Everyone here knows what Im going through they all have been there. They understand. The door on the right. Here it is my room. Hope its as good as the rest of this place has been so far. I opened the door and HOLY FUCK This room is the size of my house Two stories Couch tv bathroom study table bed wow. I looked over the small amount of things on my bed on the second floor. Saddle bags brand new textbooks pencils notebooks a dagger a what Why the fuck is there a dagger here I askedyelled while picking it up. It was built to be gripped in the teeth but it also stuck to my hoof pretty well while holding it Combat classes Okay now Im worried. I put the dagger aside and put all the school supplies into my saddle bags and noticed a fair sized pouch. Opening it showed hundreds of small pebbles They were weird and all had strange marks on them. Okay thats two questions for Tiara then. I said putting the saddle bags at the foot of the bed and put the pouch on my back and headed back out. In the living room I saw Tiara setting up plates with the hayburgers and fries. Back already She asked. Yeah uh question why was there a dagger with my school supplies Combat class. Its the basic weapon they give for it but you can get your own. Just as long as you dont go starting fights the guild lets you carry them on you. I figured. And this bag of pebbles I asked shaking the bag on my back a bit. Oh thats Rem. Its the money in this reality. Basically think of it like this one Rem is equivalent to one bit back on Equestria. So we get a weekly allowance of five hundred rem a week. Five hundred a week Is that a lot here cause back home that is a lot. Its less than minimum wage here but its more than enough for personal expenses and such. Oh. Cool. So put this in my saddle bags then Or in your Assistant thats safer. I looked at the small imprint on my leg. How Tap it. Confused I sat down using one hoof to tap the imprint and Woah A gowing display thing popped out in front of me. Little square bubbles were here and there. Woah what is this Youre menu. Heh here this will take a bit but its easy once you know what is what. Tiara spent the next few hours teaching me about the Assistant. How to customize my hud store rem inside it for safekeeping how buying things work how to work the tv. Almost everything is done with this thing imprinted on my leg. The best part was when she told me I can buy and play games on it. So cool I know right I still dont think Ive learned everything it can do. Tiara said with a nod as we finished off our dinner. Oh and the most important feature. She tapped a few things on my display downloading an app that was a red squarish oval with a sideways triangle on it. Youtube. Whats a Youtube I asked. Its like TV but anyone can upload their own videos and make their own movies and shows and such. Oh. Neat Trust me especially in studying this is a life saver. I owe so many Bs and Cs for tests I forgot to study for thanks to the videos on that app. Cool. So what will my classes be Odds are same as mine. Thats typically how the guild likes to run things. Dorm mates also take the same classes unless they are older or younger than one another but typically they are good at keeping them all in the same age range. Oh so youre fourteen too Yup So that means for the mornings well have history followed by math science Study Hall Magic and Combat class at the end of the day. How bad is Combat class Depends on who you are paired with to spar. Youre new so most likely youll be fighting some low level monster. They have us fight each other and monsters Yup. Wow this place is nuts. Trust me it only gets worse the longer you live here. Tiara said giving a laugh to my sigh. You get used to it but at the same time you dont. Thats gonna be a headache. I sighed. The little clock I now had in my hud told me it was already 1034. What time do classes start tomorrow Ten. Oh I see. She said likely seeing the time in her own hud also. Heh thats just neat. Guess we better get to bed. Yeah. Thanks for telling me how to set an alarm. Heh just remember to tap your assistant to turn it off otherwise that nose wont stop. With that she took the plates and placed them in the sink pushing a button on the faucet and magic dishwashing I know. So chores are basically non existent here. Not too bad. I said with a laugh as I got up. Night then Tiara. Night Button. Tiara said as we both headed to bed. Once inside my room I went up to my bed and climbed up onto it so much happened in so little time. Its been just a day and already it feels like it should have been longer I sighed tapping my Assistant and bringing up Youtube. Might as well see Holy shit a whole section of nothing but video games BEEP BEEP BEEP My brain I jumped falling out of bed with an oof and a thud and finishing that off with a groan as I tapped my assistant. Note to self ask Tiara how to lower the damn volume on this thing Ugh so tired. So many games not enough time to watch them all so many subscriptions to those funny people. I got up turning my neck as it popped and the short jolt of pain then relief woke me up a bit. I went to the bathroom thankfully there are towles here and I was able to take a quick shower. Guess Ill have to buy my own soap soon since the bottles they give are pretty small. Once out I began drying off. Yay free toothbrush and toothpaste too. I cleaned off the fog from the mirror and began to brush my teeth then dropped my toothbrush as I saw my teeth. My teeth are different The front ones were a lot thinner I had four smaller sharp ones like a dogs and the rest behind the sharp ones looked normal. What the Why are my teeth like this I poked a sharp looking one with a hoof they were sharp. Nothing that can draw blood by touch but with a hard bite After brushing my apparent new teeth I headed out with my bags packed with my supplies and the dagger and saw Tiara at the dining table eating some waffles. Morning. Morning So why do I have new teeth I was wondering if youd notice that. She said swallowing her food then giving me a tooth filled smile. Woah Her too Its part of the changes. On top of being able to respawn aging til an adult then basically staying the same physical age forever or until we change it we also get omnivore teeth. So we can eat meat Dont have to but we can now and it wont bother us. Huh maybe not soon Its not bad once you get over the initial fear the taste is pretty good. ...huh I thought for a while after that eating breakfast and finishing it of my licking the syrup on the plate. So when should we leave for class They start at ten. Well be auto teleported there til then. I looked at my clock. 904. So anything else you wanna know about Yeah. I was up late watching Youtube Everyones addiction. And there was this one guy who kept talking about in game abilities being nothing like the real world ones So what are abilities exactly Abilities perhaps some of the most important things to know about whether you explore and adventure or not. Abilities do everything from give you powers you can use to boosting things about yourself like your speed strength ect. Huh. How many are there Nobody knows. The Family makes new ones and variations of existing ones all the time and that just makes things more interesting and confusing at times. Cool do you have any Two. Scan its one of the first abilities you can get once you gain your first skill points and Projectile feathers. She then flapped her wings and I looked at the floor and some of her pink feathers were in the ground. That is amazing. Theres all kinds and what you can unlock first all depends on how you use your skill points to improve yourself or completely change yourself. All up to you. Neat. And Skill points unlock them How do I get them Damn near any way possible. You can fight and earth them in dungeons complete challenges ranging from easy for a few to super complicated and specific for a bunch join a guild and complete their guild affiliated goals and they give you some as rewards among other stuff. The Caretakers guild here even gives them out for things like good team work good behaviour good grades ect. Cool. You cant buy them then huh You can but they are two trillion rem each. Excuse me what While yes you can earn a lot doing the work for them to sell one for all that labor even just one is like just handing someone over a free pass for less work. So they sell for a ton of money. You ever sold one Heck no Im working towards unlocking a new ability that takes three skill points and I only have one. Oh. So what ability are you working towards Minor Self Healing. Basically little bits of damage I get will heal itself over a few minutes. Bigger wounds will take hours. Self healing abilities are a good investment. Well guess when I get some Skill Points I should invest in Abilities like that. Go with Scan first it tells you how much health your opponent has. Its a mandatory first ability. Okay then. So any super epic abilities that everyone wants Tons. Generation Copy Cat Amplify Transfer Foresight Loop Analyze. Thats just a few of the Legendary class abilities. Huh. What do they do Well Generation lets you create and generate power of the different energies you can acquire. Magic Void Nothingness Balance Fire Water ect. It lets you generate as much as your body can hold and the stronger you get the more of the energies you can hold. Copy Cat is the one that if you have it you just win at life. All you need to do is see someone use their ability and you have that ability for yourself. Thats pretty overpowered. Hence why its a Legendary ability. Amplify makes the energy you have naturally more potent. Boosting its power and potential as if you had more in the tanks to pour in. Transfer actually les you take abilities from one person and keep or give them to other people. You just need to touch them to make it work. Foresight is really cool. While in combat if you use it you can catch glimpses of your opponents moves before they act giving you an edge in combat. Loop is a lot like Generation. So long as you have one other person to use it with Loop will cycle all your energies together and between you two boosting their power and amount by nearly double or more each loop. Hence the name. Analyze lets you look at anything machines mostly and instantly understand everything about it from how it works to how to build and take them apart. So if I had that I could just immediately know everything the books have in them Tiara laughed. Yeah but thats not the best use for a legendary ability. No way its the best way to use it I declared jokingly. And IF you ever get it you can use it that way. But thats a big IF. Legendary abilities arent unlocked like the rest they are received either as level five dungeon prizes or as a prize in the Grandmasters Arena or just appear to you randomly sometimes. They can appear randomly Why No one knows. Some think its the Family watching us and helping us when they think we need it. Others think its some unknown requirement to receive it. Its all just guess work. Huh. What about The Family You mentioned them before Remember the Family of heros that merged to create The Mother I nodded. That family. Oh. That makes sense. So they rule this reality then Not sure if Rule is the right word more like oversee it. The guilds were all founded to help manage various things here and there from big to small so yeah. No real kings or queens. Some people worship The Mother and The Family like gods they are way more than that but you know its up to if you want to. Huh. So are we allowed off campus We are so long as its after the school hours and if it gets to ten at night we are auto teleported back. Safety measures and all that. Teleporting is useful huh. So useful. She said with a nod. Still have about forty minutes to kill. Wanna watch TV Whats on Better question is what isnt on. Tiara said as she flew up and onto the couch. I quickly made my way over and sat down. She held up her Assistant to the TV a beam shooting out from it to the TV as a remote made of light appeared floating under her hoof. Woah Yeah. She said the TV turning on as she flipped through channels. She stopped on what looked like a cartoon from home no not a cartoon Comic. Is that Power Ponies I asked surprised. Yeah. They were a comic that got a TV show back on my world. Wow. Back home it was still just a Comic. TVs were still fairly new mostly just showed news and a few cartoons. Nothing like Power Ponies. Even so I mostly stayed at home playing or at the arcade. Neat what did you play Mr and Mrs Packmare Space Invaders Diskus Hunt and Dance Dance. Dance Dance seriously Hey that game gave me some of the best reaction times and hoof eye coordination ever. I am eighty percent sure that game is how I got a perfect score on Diskus Hunts pro shooter mode. Heh Ive only ever played Frogger. But arriving here I played a few others over the years. Mostly just time killer games like Temple Run and Fallout StableShelter. StableShelter Theyre the same game but ya know multiverses all merged into one reality so. Ah Right. So think maybe you can show me around after school Sure. Around town then I take it Yeah Decorate my room and such. You can buy some from the Assistant but yeah. Youll have to show me how. I said with a laugh. We watched the show til I blinked and we were in class. The room was pretty normal looking I suppose. Dang it. Always at the good part. Tiara sighed as she took out her books. I looked around. This did look like a history class. Tiara and I were in a row with about three other empty desks. Behind and in front of us were other rows of desks filled with others. Some ponies some other races some races I didnt know the names to. Looking over I saw the teacher. He was a pony I think. He stood on two legs and looked kinga like how the minotaur look but not at buff at all. I just shrugged and too my books and notebooks out as well as a pen. Now class The teacher started. We have a new commer to the Guild Button Mash. So to help them catch up will will be doing a quick review of the semesters lessons. Those of you who want to listen to refresh your memory and notes can follow along if you dont then please try not to make any noise. He stated simply. My name is Reference Point but you can call me Me. Point. With that Mr. Point began the review. Majority of this stuff I already knew but there was more details to it now. Names like Cript King Eclipsa Max John The Foretellers and other major members of the family and what they did in the war. After that it was mostly talk about all the different worlds colonized across the stars which is so damn awesome and the places of significance between them. Huh so I was on a different world when I arrived and when Echo Dash picked me up we teleported all the way to the first world of this reality. Homeworld. The largest and most populated. Which makes sense. Next up was Math and thankfully it was stuff I knew from back home so it wasnt that difficult at all. Science was neat. Rather than just writing out formulas for chemical equations we got to watch the teacher bring a dead frog back to life using various chemicals. Study hall was calm just all of us in a room reviewing notes. Those who werent reviewing notes got an early start on homework or were killing time doing whatever. Finally this is a class I have been waiting for Magic. I sat eagerly but turned to Tiara when she gave my side a poke. So before she gets here you know who Twilight Sparkle is right Yeah. She became Princess of Equestria back home. Wait is she our teacher Yes but its a reflection of her. I raised a brow. Its what we call parallel version of others. I nodded. So thats the term. This Twilight Sparkle is actually part of The Family. My eyes shot up. Yeah. Married to Cript himself and sister to Eclipsa of Grey. Shes insanely powerful. Then why is she teaching magic here and not at some advanced school Cause she wants to. Just letting you know beforehand. Hand Hoof hand eh. Same meaning. She shrugged. A short time later the teacher entered. She was definitely Twilight Sparkle. Not the princess from back home more like the librarian turned Alicorn back when I was a foal. Bit taller I think. Good evening class. I understand we have a new student here. She then looked at me. Button. Welcome to the class and to our world. Uh thanks. I said sheepishly. Now then since you are new youll need some spells to get started. Her horn lit up and on my desk suddenly appeared two things. A scroll and a glowing light blue gem. Thats a Mana gem it will let give you a starting amount of Mana to use for spells more than what you can grow on your own and the scroll holds a basic telekinesis spell. It will come in very useful. Tiara as his roommate please help Button learn to utilize the spell. Everyone else please turn to page 56 of your textbooks and study the matrix diagrams. Everyone did as told and Tiara turned to face me. So ready She asked. Yeah. I said with a smile and a nod looking the gem over. So how does it work Take it in your fetlock and squeeze it. Once you have youll see some text in your hud asking if you wanna absorb it. Select yes. I did that Squeezing the gem and blinking as the text appeared. New Elemental Gem Detected. Mana Gem. Absorb into DNA for use Yes No How do I select yes I asked. Just focus on it for a bit. I did just that and after a bit the yes button glowed and the gem melted in my grip and flowed inside my coat and skin. That felt weird. Mana Gem Absorbed. Current Mana usage 50MP. Recharge time when used is 2 hours. It self recharges my Mana Yup. Now for the scroll. Just open it if youd please. Inside just that and once I did the scroll lifted itself out of my hooves and proofed in a puff of smoke and was gone. New Spell Learned Telekinesis That thats it Thought I had to read it. I dont really get it either but thats how it is. Now then Telekinesis hardly used any mana to use. Maybe one MP a minute at most. So basically you just gotta focus on an object and imagine holding it with your hoof or even fetlock and moving it that way. Try with your pencil. I nodded looking at my pencil and trying to imagine holding it in my teeth or in my fetlock and hey it worked I blinked and smiled as it flew around writing my name on the paper like how Id write with it in my teeth. This is easier than I expected. How come theres no aura around it though Youre not a unicorn. Ones magic manifests on objects and in spells differently. Heh well guess I dont have to deal with chewed up spit covered pencils anymore. It was a blessing when I realized that too. So typically you can only lift what you can physically hold so dont go trying to lift up boulders and houses. The rest of class I learned about spell Matrixes and the basics of that. Ways if keeping an object enchanted or to use the matrix to boost a spell I cast with ambient mama in the air or soil. Finally it was Combat class. It felt a lot more like Gym class. I had my dagger on my back and Tiara had The fuck is that I asked her. Tiara looked back at her weapon it was a long metal thing strapped to a weird looking saddle she wore that linked a little lever it has to a bite grip the saddle placed just in front of her mouth. An M1918 Browning automatic rifle. Its a machine gun. Do they not have guns on your Equestria I shook my head. Hmm. Cannons I nodded. Its a more compact cannon that shoots more than once and way faster. Woah Attention The teacher said making everyone stand up straight. I followed suit. The teacher here wasnt a pony. In fact I am pretty sure hes what did Tiara say he was Anthro No Human yes yeah that was it Human. He had a light caramel skin color with black sunglasses over his eyes and a very short amount of hair on his head. I was told we have a new student. Up front newbie I jumped stepping forward. Name Button Mash. Alright Mash Im MR. Collins. You ever been in a fight No. Ever take self defense classes No. Ever get bullied by the older kids and fight back Just emotionally and no. Jesus Christ kid you sound sad. Well today that all changes Into the arena He noticed I was looking at him confused while everyone else was taking steps back behind some lines in the floor. Just stand there and wait alright I nodded as he left to the outside line to and over to a wall screen he taped his Assistant to. The floor I was on immediately began going down a ways til it was about thirty feet below with the rest of this floor. Alright then Im gonna summon in a basic Shadow Creature for you to fight. Mr. Collins said from above. Shadow what I questioned as in a puff of dark mist appeared a small dark purple creature with bug like antenna atop its head. It had no visible mouth and body looked like a bad childs drawing with thin legs and arms ending in some claws. It looked at me with bright glowing white eyes. The fuck This is a basic Shadow Creature. A very common monster to appear outside the safe zones. They can also appear inside the safe zones but only under certain events. One alone isnt much of a threat they arent too smart either. Your assignment for class here is to kill it. Uh alright I gulped using telekinesis to place the daggers grip in my mouth as I walked up to the twitching thing. I tried kicking it with a leg and it dodged Ouch I winced the thing swiped its arm cutting me. It wasnt deep but was deep enough to bleed. Now I was a bit pissed as I swung with the dagger the thing jumped on my head and I moved frantically to shake it off feeling it slice at my head. Fucking get off Use your magic Button I heard Tiara yell out. Magic All I know is oh I cast Telekinesis on the small monster getting it off my head and just to be safe I spun it around and then swung with the dagger. The small thing was cut in half splashing silver liquid all around the floor that quickly evaporated. About seven rem fell from where its body melted. I pocketed that. The floor came back up Mr. Collins was clapping. Good job. Better than most their first fight with a shadow. Tiara take him to the nurses office for a quick fix. Tiara flew up next to me and walked me down the halls. Not bad. Better than mine. How so I asked with a smile. The cuts stung but oddly I felt great. I just flew above it trying to drop the dagger in it. She said with a laugh. That was bad. I laughed too. That does sound bad. This ever get easier Only if you work hard. Tiara said with a sigh. Helps if you have a goal. Huh whats your goal Hmm been here three years and never really had a goal in mind. Really Yeah. Sight see maybe but all in all I never had a goal in mind. Huh I said. I wonder what could my goal be Back home I only ever wanted the high scores on all the arcade games. Had most of them. Hey Tiara is there like a leader board thing Hm Well sorta yeah. A list of the strongest people in all the guilds and such. Strongest right now in reality is Jericho the Undead. Why I looked at the floor smiling a bit. Why not. Im gonna beat his high score. You want to be number one strongest in reality Sure. Even if its just for a little while. Huh you know with Injuries you got from one Shadow Creature youll need a medic to heal you up. You wanna be my medic The path to unlocking self healing abilities also branches into other healing spells and the likes. Might as well. Not like I have any plans for myself. She laughed. Sounds like it could be fun. Thanks Tiara. And like that I had a goal. A goal and a friend.,Mature,Crossovers & Fandom FusionsMultiple CrossoversCrossover
